NZS Capital, a public equities hedge fund, bases its investment philosophy on [[complexity_investing_principles | complexity theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This approach stems from the recognition that markets, like the world, are complex adaptive systems where the future cannot be precisely predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Instead of focusing on predictions, their strategy emphasizes adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Complexity Theory as a Foundation

Complex adaptive systems are ubiquitous and govern how the world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. These systems create "emergent behavior," rendering precise future prediction useless in most cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. While heuristics and guidelines are helpful, exact outcomes are difficult to foresee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This perspective contrasts sharply with traditional economics, which often relies on models that don't reflect real-world market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

The Santa Fe Institute, founded by scientists from Los Alamos National Labs, explores these concepts, connecting hard sciences with economics to understand complexity and how to think about the future in such systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. NZS Capital members have taken courses at the Santa Fe Institute, delving deep into these ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Core Investment Principles

NZS Capital's investment philosophy is built on two primary concepts: **resilience** and **optionality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Resilience
Resilience refers to the ability of a company to achieve durable, long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. NZS Capital defines this as companies that can grow steadily (e.g., 10-12% annually) for decades, yielding tremendous value creation through [[value_investing_vs_growth_investing | compounding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

An analogy used to explain resilience is the behavior of ants: half the ants in a colony are often inactive, as ants are optimized for longevity and resilience rather than pure productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This contrasts with many modern companies optimized for short-term productivity and quarterly earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Companies that embrace long-term thinking, often founder-led, are more interesting from a resilience perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

Characteristics of resilient companies include:
*   **Mission Criticality and Switching Costs**: Products or services deeply embedded in customer operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   **Scale**: Companies like TSMC that leverage power laws, where one company captures a significant portion of industry profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Network Effects**: Digital markets where a few players dominate economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

NZS Capital is wary of the traditional concept of "moats" if it implies extracting maximum value from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Their firm name, NZS Capital (Non-Zero Sum), reflects a desire for win-win outcomes across all stakeholders, including employees, customers, society, and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Companies that "create more value than they take" are seen as more resilient long-term, even if it means giving up some short-term profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

> "15% growth over 10 years would deliver more than a 300% return, but 15% growth over 15 years would almost double the 10-year return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

### Optionality
Optionality involves making investments where the future outcome is uncertain but the potential upside is asymmetric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. This is akin to venture capital investing, where a small probability of a massive win outweighs the higher probability of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. NZS Capital seeks to expose itself to such opportunities in public equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

For example, a broad prediction like "electronics will push deeper into the world" is safer and likely to happen in "nine out of ten copies of the multiverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. A narrower prediction, like "Tesla will dominate the EV market," might only happen in "two out of ten copies of the multiverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. The latter represents an optionality play: highly asymmetric if correct, but not catastrophic to the portfolio if incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

## Integrating Principles: The Portfolio Structure

NZS Capital constructs its portfolio with two distinct parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>:

*   **Resilience**: A concentrated portfolio (around 15 names, over half the total portfolio) of mature, healthy growers like Microsoft or TSMC, with low turnover (around 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. These are "set it and forget it" investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   **Optionality**: A distributed portfolio (around 40 names, just under half the total portfolio) with smaller position sizes (max 1.5% of portfolio), focusing on earlier-stage public companies with high upside potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. This part of the portfolio turns over more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.

Some companies combine both, possessing a resilient core business with layered optionality. These are dubbed "Root Moats" (Resilience with Out-of-the-Money Optionality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. Classic examples include Amazon (where AWS was unforeseen optionality) or eBay (where PayPal was undervalued optionality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. The best CEOs also apply this thinking, balancing core business resilience with investments in future options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

## Power Law Distributions vs. Normal Distributions

Traditional [[the_role_of_skill_and_luck_in_investing_and_decision_making | risk models]] are based on normal (Gaussian) distributions, but the world often operates on power law distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. In a power law distribution, a few events (or investments) yield disproportionately large outcomes, while many yield little or nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

This concept is illustrated by a coin-flipping contest where winning nets $50 and losing costs $40. While the *ensemble average* (average across many participants) is positive, the *time average* (individual experience over time) is often loss or bankruptcy because a few people win massively, while many go bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. This is known as a non-ergodic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

For investors, this means focusing on "slugging percentage" over "batting average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>. It's acceptable to be wrong frequently in optionality bets if the few wins are significant enough to drive overall portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>. "Conviction" in investing can be viewed as overconfidence, leading to bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. Instead, NZS Capital seeks to maximize the probability of getting lucky by diversifying optionality bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. This aligns with Warren Buffett's idea that "it's better to be approximately right than exactly wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

## Portfolio Management in Practice

In managing the optionality portion of the portfolio, NZS Capital often trims winners that have grown significantly and hit a predetermined cap, preventing them from dominating the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. Sometimes, these companies may transition into the resilient bucket if their business structurally changes and matures into a durable compounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. The key is to admit when an investment thesis is wrong and move on quickly, especially with smaller, optional positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

The current market environment, characterized by high valuations across all asset classes, forces predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. NZS Capital responds by shifting the portfolio more towards resilience, focusing on foundational building blocks of the information age, such as semiconductors, where valuations are considered reasonable and importance is enduring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

## The Human Element and Culture

NZS Capital views investing as a team sport, with team members actively calling out each other's biases, recognizing that bias is hard to self-identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>. They intentionally build a culture that expects failure in optionality positions, allowing them to take risks without torpedoing the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

Their research process incorporates "unstructured research time," where they can explore topics without a predefined outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. This allows for unexpected "aha moments" and insights that might not emerge from highly structured work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:16">[01:55:16]</a>. This approach highlights the importance of [[learning_evolution_and_openmindedness_in_investing | learning, evolution, and open-mindedness in investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

NZS Capital's approach values slow, methodical, and governed growth over short-term hyper-growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. A 20% annual growth rate over 30 years, for instance, leads to immense value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:37">[01:52:37]</a>. This is achieved by having "negative feedback loops" or natural governors on growth, which ultimately ensure the long-term health and duration of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:12">[01:52:12]</a>. This philosophy contributes to [[investment_strategy_and_personal_suitability | skill set alignment in investment strategies]] by emphasizing endurance and adaptability.

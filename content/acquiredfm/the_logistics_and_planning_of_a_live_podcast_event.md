The [[history_and_growth_of_acquired_podcast | Acquired podcast]] embarked on an unprecedented venture by hosting a live event at the Chase Center, showcasing the intricate planning and strategic partnerships required to bring such a large-scale production to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This event marked a significant milestone, transforming the audio-first experience of a [[podcasting_and_content_creation | podcast]] into a grand physical instantiation of the [[history_and_growth_of_acquired_podcast | Acquired]] brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Origin of Acquired Live at Chase Center

The idea for the Chase Center show originated from a conversation with the JP Morgan team, who initially mentioned a small event in a corner of the Chase Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This sparked the realization of potential access to the venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The JP Morgan Payments team then took the initiative, proposing a dedicated [[event_planning_and_production_for_acquired_live | Acquired Live]] event at the Chase Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Strategic Partnership with JP Morgan Payments

A critical component of the event's success was the deep partnership with JP Morgan Payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The collaboration was deemed "really special" due to JP Morgan's understanding of the [[history_and_growth_of_acquired_podcast | Acquired]] show, largely because their team members are listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This alignment meant that any ideas for joint ventures "fit like a glove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The partnership enabled the achievement of something neither entity could have done alone, making it a "spectacular example" of collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. JP Morgan Paymentsâ€™ approach was to allow [[history_and_growth_of_acquired_podcast | Acquired]] to "be [[history_and_growth_of_acquired_podcast | Acquired]]" while wanting to be a part of it, recognizing payments as a centerpiece in building businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Event Preparation and Design

Preparing for the event was described as a "mad dash" to create an amazing experience for thousands of attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Key decisions included determining the show's opening, such as whether to start "hot" with a Jensen video or to walk out with Perkins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

A significant aspect of the [[event_planning_and_production_for_acquired_live | event planning]] was the design and artwork, led by artist Don <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The collaboration with JP Morgan Payments extended to the visual elements, from posters to stage art and everything in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The goal was to create a "big and grandiose and bright" visual experience that would resonate at the live event and bring together all themes in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Seeing the entire stadium lit up with custom artwork was a unique experience for the design team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Key Preparatory Activities:
*   **Ticket Sales**: Tracking ticket sales closely, with rows disappearing quickly as the event approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Guest Confirmations**: Securing prominent guests like Emily Chang, Daniel X, and Mike Taylor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Mike Taylor, a major recording artist with hundreds of millions of Spotify listens, was arranged to sing the [[history_and_growth_of_acquired_podcast | Acquired]] theme song live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Refinement**: The final days involved "sprinkling into the stew" to perfect the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The team recognized that the planned spectacle would be so grand that "it doesn't matter what we say" on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Audience Engagement and Pre-Show Traditions

A unique element of the [[acquired_podcast_segments_and_community_engagement | community engagement]] for [[event_planning_and_production_for_acquired_live | Acquired Live]] was a pre-show run with over 100 listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This tradition, stemming from the hosts' personal routine of running together, allowed them to interact with the [[podcasting_strategy_and_audience_engagement | audience]] and work out nerves before the main event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## The Live Show Experience

The event was described as "unbelievable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> and "beyond anything that we could have hoped or dreamed for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The arena was completely filled for the main discussion with Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Mark's appearance was "electric," as he deviated from the playbook from the moment he stepped on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. A key moment included Zuckerberg's candid admission of a "20-year mistake" regarding Facebook/Meta's political miscalculation, which stunned the [[podcasting_strategy_and_audience_engagement | audience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Impact and Future Outlook

The [[event_planning_and_production_for_acquired_live | Acquired Live]] event served as the "ultimate physical instantiation" of the [[history_and_growth_of_acquired_podcast | Acquired]] brand, a feat previously thought impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The success of the event left the hosts in a mindset of both "let's go big" and "never again," balancing ambition with the demands of such a large-scale undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The positive impact and reception suggest a possibility for future events, with murmurs of "2025" for the next one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

This episode is dedicated to Tom Alberg, a long-time Amazon board member and founder of Madrona Venture Group, who sadly passed away between the recording and release of this episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Influence and Contributions
Tom Alberg had a profound [[impact_of_history_and_relationships_in_silicon_valley|impact]] on the careers of the Acquired hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His influence extended to Seattle and the broader [[history_and_strategy_of_technology_companies|technology]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Alberg was instrumental in establishing:
*   The law firm Perkins Coie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Telecommunications firms Western Wireless and McCaw Cellular, which contributed significantly to the infrastructure used for modern phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

He was also the longest-serving Amazon board member, other than Jeff Bezos himself, serving for 23 years and holding the position of lead independent director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. His role had a huge [[impact_of_history_and_relationships_in_silicon_valley|impact]] on Amazon as a company and on the hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

## Role in Amazon's Early Days
Tom Alberg was an early investor in Amazon, providing an "early check" in the company's $1 million seed round at a $5 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>. He was one of the most involved local business figures in Seattle who contributed to this initial funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:16">[01:31:16]</a>. He also maintained his position as a board member through the late 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>.

During a pivotal moment, Alberg recounted how legendary venture capitalist John Doerr persistently sought to connect with him to invest in Amazon, calling every 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>. Alberg noted that this persistence was one of John Doerr's great strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. Amazon ultimately chose Kleiner Perkins, led by John Doerr, for their Series A round, which was $8 million at a $60 million post-money valuation, despite competing offers with close to double the valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>. Jeff Bezos, with Alberg's counsel, insisted that Doerr himself join the board for the deal to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:24">[01:34:24]</a>.

Tom Alberg's background as a high-profile corporate lawyer made him a valuable asset during key business meetings, such as the dinner with the Rigo brothers, founders of Barnes & Noble, who were Amazon's direct competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:31">[01:52:31]</a>.

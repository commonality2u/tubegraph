The end of the Cold War in the early 1990s marked a significant shift for the United States' defense industry, leading to a period of intense mergers and consolidations that reshaped the landscape of American defense contracting.

## The "Last Supper" and Industry Consolidation

By the early to mid-1990s, it became evident that the Cold War era of arms build-up was over, and defense budgets were set to shrink massively, necessitating nuclear disarmament and the destruction of nuclear warheads [02:35:18]. This realization led to a pivotal event in July 1993, dubbed "the last supper" by the CEO of Martin Marietta [02:35:37]. The then-Deputy Defense Secretary, William Perry, called the CEOs of all major prime defense contractors to a dinner in Washington, explicitly informing them that defense spending would decrease substantially and instructing them to consolidate and merge with one another [02:35:41]. This direct government intervention signaled that the Defense Department could no longer support the existing number of contractors [02:36:07]. This event kicked off an era of intentional government policy around combining defense companies [02:36:47].

The government's intent was to maintain America's industrial base and capability to build defense systems, even as the market for these products was shrinking [02:37:38]. The logic was that without consolidation, companies would go out of business, leading to a loss of skilled personnel and manufacturing capabilities essential for national security [02:37:50]. This policy, unique in American industry, prioritized maintaining the military industrial base over fostering traditional market competition [02:37:07].

## Key Mergers and Acquisitions

Following this directive, a rapid series of mergers and acquisitions reshaped the industry:

*   **Lockheed's Acquisition of General Dynamics Fighter Jet Business**
    In 1993, Lockheed purchased General Dynamics' fighter jet business, including the F-16 [02:38:52]. This brought the F-16, a plane that [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed]] had previously lost the bid for to General Dynamics, back into the company's portfolio [02:15:17].
*   **Lockheed and Martin Marietta Merger**
    In 1994, [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed]] and Martin Marietta announced a "merger of equals" that was finalized in 1995, forming [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed Martin]] [02:38:58]. This combined company comprised 17 previously independent entities, including General Dynamics, Sanders, GE Aerospace, RCA Aerospace, and IBM Federal Systems [02:44:22].
    *   **Spin-outs**: Not all assets were merged. Martin Marietta's minerals and mining business spun out as a separate, publicly traded company [02:39:15]. Additionally, L3 Communications was formed from a set of assets that did not combine into [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed Martin]] [02:39:35].
*   **Acquisition of Loral's Defense Business**
    In January 1996, shortly after the [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed Martin]] merger, the new entity acquired the defense business from Loral for almost $10 billion [02:40:25].
*   **Attempted Merger with Northrop Grumman**
    In July 1997, [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed Martin]] attempted to merge with Northrop Grumman, but this merger was blocked by the Department of Justice due to concerns about reduced competition [02:40:31]. The DOJ recognized that combining [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed]] and Northrop, two primary competitors for large defense contracts like the B2 bomber, would eliminate too much competition [02:41:02].
*   **Boeing's Merger with McDonnell Douglas**
    Also in 1997, Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas [02:41:25]. This consolidation was partly driven by the intense competition for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) F-35 program, which was expected to be the largest military contract ever [02:41:40]. When McDonnell Douglas was eliminated from the competition, its merger with Boeing became necessary to create a formidable competitor to [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed Martin]] [02:42:25].

## Characteristics of the Consolidated Industry

The post-Cold War consolidation resulted in a highly concentrated defense industry, dominated by a few "prime contractors": [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed Martin]], Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics [02:39:47].

*   **"Too Big to Fail" Entities**: These prime contractors are described as "too big to fail" entities, cooperating closely with the government and mutually dependent on each other for existence [02:59:28].
*   **Government as the Sole Customer**: The U.S. government acts as the single primary customer, influencing industry structure and directing activities [03:19:39]. [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed Martin]] is the single largest recipient of federal spending as a contractor, with approximately 75% of its total revenue coming from the U.S. federal government [03:00:45], and the rest from allies [03:01:35].
*   **Profit Margins and Cost-Plus Contracts**: Profit margins for these companies are relatively low, typically around 8-10% net income [03:01:51]. This is attributed to the prevalence of "cost-plus" contracts, where the government pays for the cost of development plus a predetermined profit margin [03:02:03]. While useful for unknown costs in critical projects like the U2 spy plane, this model discourages innovation that aims for operating leverage or risk-taking common in the tech industry [03:03:56].
*   **"Pork Barrel" Politics and Job Creation**: Large defense programs, such as the F-22 (built in 46 states, employing 95,000 jobs) [02:53:01] and the F-35 (requiring 95,000 people to build), are spread across many states and countries to ensure political support from members of Congress who seek to create jobs for their constituents [02:53:50]. This makes it challenging to cut programs even if they become inefficient [02:53:54].
*   **Impact on Innovation and Agility**: This highly structured and centralized approach contrasts sharply with the "Skunk Works" model of rapid iteration and small, autonomous teams that characterized earlier periods of innovation at [[lockheed_martin_and_its_role_in_american_defense | Lockheed]] [02:57:50]. The sheer scale and political entanglement of modern defense projects slow down development and increase costs [02:46:53].
*   **New Entrant Challenges**: It has become extremely difficult, if not impossible, for new companies to become a "prime contractor" in the defense industry, given the established relationships, massive infrastructure, and complex integration capabilities required [03:16:41].

The consolidation reflects a strategic decision by the U.S. government to ensure the maintenance of essential defense capabilities in a shrinking budget environment, resulting in an interdependent relationship between the public and private sectors in defense [02:59:22].

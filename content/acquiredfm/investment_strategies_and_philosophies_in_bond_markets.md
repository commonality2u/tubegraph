## The Peril of Rigidity in Investing

A significant impediment to profitability in [[Investing strategies and approaches | investing strategies and approaches]] is rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Open-mindedness and the continuous evolution of one's thinking are crucial for effective [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | investment strategy and decision making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This philosophy is especially pertinent in bond markets, where conventional wisdom can often overlook profitable opportunities.

## Discovering High-Yield Bonds

When tasked with managing money in Citibank's bond department, the speaker was asked to understand high-yield bonds and establish a fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This was considered a "backwater" area at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Most [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | investment organizations]] had strict rules against purchasing bonds rated below "A" or "Triple B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, leading many to avoid single B bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The absence of other bidders in such an overlooked market is typically a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Milken's Early Insights

Mike Milken, who graduated from Wharton in the same year the speaker graduated from Chicago (1969), had an early interest in low-rated bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He reportedly found inspiration in a book by Hickman, which detailed bond experiences from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This book suggested that the lower a bond's rating, the higher its actual rate of return was, not just its promised yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Even with defaults and bankruptcies, including those during the Great Depression, the excess yield received from these bonds more than compensated for credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

At that time, it was nearly impossible to issue low-rated bonds, often labeled "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Major banks and investment banks were not involved in issuing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Moody's manual, in 1978, even defined a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, stating they were "not proper for investment regardless of price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## The Life Insurance Analogy for Risk Assessment

A key [[Investment Philosophy of Howard Marks and Andrew Marks | investment philosophy]] for high-yield bonds parallels the business model of life insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. When asked how one could invest in bonds knowing some would default, the speaker drew this comparison:

*   **Awareness of Risk:** Like life insurance companies knowing people will die, investors in high-yield bonds are aware of the risk of default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Analyzable Risk:** Just as insurers analyze health to price policies, bond investors analyze the creditworthiness of issuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Diversifiable Risk:** Insurers diversify their policyholders (not just skydivers or smokers); high-yield bond investors diversify across various issuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Well-Compensated Risk:** Insurers price policies to be well-paid for the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>; similarly, the excess yield in high-yield bonds compensates for potential losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This creates a "margin of safety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

This approach enabled steady and safe returns from investing in what were considered the "worst public companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Contrasting with the "Nifty 50" Era

The speaker's entry into the investment business in 1969 coincided with Citibank's focus on the "Nifty 50" â€“ companies deemed the "best and fastest growing" in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The prevailing belief was that these companies were immune to bad outcomes and that "there was no price too high" to pay for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

This was the "polar opposite" of the high-yield bond market, where bonds were deemed "not appropriate for investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> and no price was considered low enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Both stances were ultimately proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

[[Lessons from past investment trends and their outcomes | Lessons from past investment trends and their outcomes]] show that those who bought the Nifty 50 in 1969 and held for five years often lost almost all their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This was primarily because they were priced excessively high; many sold at 60-90 times earnings, compared to a normal S&P P/E ratio of 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Examples of Nifty 50 companies and their fates:

*   **IBM:** While not bankrupt, it faced significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The common saying was "you can't be fired for buying IBM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Xerox:** Lost market share to imports and had to find a new business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Patterns:** Once a major consumer company in the Nifty 50, its business model became obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The concept of "disruption" and the vulnerability of "moats" were not considered in the Nifty 50 era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The assumption that high pricing by Xerox would not invite foreign competition proved false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Many Nifty 50 companies experienced losses of over 90% from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Core Philosophical Takeaways for Bond Investing

The contrast between the "Nifty 50" and high-yield bonds underscores a fundamental principle in [[comparing_investment_approaches_in_global_markets | comparing investment approaches]]: the price paid is paramount, regardless of the perceived quality of the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Even the "best" companies can become poor [[Investment Strategies Resilience and Optionality | investments]] if bought at an excessive price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, while "undesirable" assets can yield strong returns if acquired at a sufficiently low price that compensates for inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Hermès operates with a unique approach to branding and marketing, largely rejecting conventional strategies embraced by other luxury brands. Its philosophy centers on enduring quality, craftsmanship, and a carefully cultivated mystique, rather than aggressive advertising or mass-market appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>.

## Core Philosophy and Identity

Hermès prioritizes craft and a reputation for quality, remaining independent while other luxury brands merge into conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>. The company emphasizes that 85% of its production is still done by hand by master craftspeople in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Its deep roots in French and Parisian history are a key part of its identity, evoking a nostalgic, pre-modern era where the horse was primary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.

> "At Hermès, these are not different people. Now, obviously, there is a different CEO and artistic director that are both members of the same family and who are cousins, but in spirit they're cut from the same cloth and they apprentice as creative craftspeople and they collectively and the family is in charge as much of the creative side of the house as they are of the business side." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>

The company also maintains a "no consultants" policy, a lesson potentially learned from past recommendations to outsource production and lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

## Evolution of Identity and Products

Originally a saddle maker, Hermès adapted its business as the world shifted from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The **Haut à Courroies** bag, initially designed to carry saddles and boots, became the spiritual heritage to the iconic Kelly and Birkin bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>.

### The "Dream" and Whimsy
Robert Dumas, from the fourth generation of the family, introduced an element of "whimsy and real art" into the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. This is evident in:
*   The **Shen donra bracelet**, inspired by boat anchors on a foggy beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.
*   The **silk scarves**, introduced in 1937, which feature whimsical artwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. These scarves became a huge phenomenon, even popularized globally by Queen Elizabeth wearing them as headscarves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   The [[Rolexs Marketing and Branding Strategies | Hermès Orange Box]], which became iconic after being adopted during a wartime shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. Hermès even claims ownership of this color, asserting control over a spectrum of oranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   The **Hermès logo**, a hitched carriage waiting groom, designed post-WWII to ground the brand in its unique history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
*   **Window displays** at the flagship store, designed by theater set designers, which are seen as "portals into this world of dream and art" rather than product showcases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>.

### Luxury as Art
Hermès operates on the principle that luxury means paying more not for utility, but for intrinsic pleasure or as an extrinsic signal of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. Art, having "zero utility," is seen as luxury taken to its logical extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>. When customers buy an Hermès product, they are buying "a piece of art, a piece of their heritage, a feeling that connects you to the maker and the place it was created" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. This allows Hermès to disconnect from conventional value evaluation, as the priceless feeling bundled with the product makes its value unknowable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

## Strategic Differentiation

Hermès distinguishes itself by upholding traditional craftsmanship and refusing to compromise on quality or accessibility.

### The Saddle Stitch and Production
The signature saddle stitch, an incredibly strong and durable hand-stitching technique, is used for every bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:02">[02:23:02]</a>. One artisan makes a single Kelly bag from start to finish using 36 unique pieces of high-quality leather, a process taking 20 hours over a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. This knowledge, referred to as "savoir-faire" (know-how), is transmitted from one craftsperson to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

To scale production while maintaining this ethos, Hermès has built its own training pipeline for master craftspeople. They open trade schools in rural French areas with high unemployment, ensuring 100% graduation rates and offering jobs to artisans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:23">[02:48:23]</a>. The average age of an Hermès artisan is 30, and 80% are women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>. Today, Hermès has 31 workshops across France, each with no more than 250-300 craftspeople to maintain a "workshop" feel, not a "factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>. They aim to increase production capacity by 7% annually, hiring 500 new artisans each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:21">[02:47:21]</a>.

### The Birkin and Kelly Phenomenon
The Kelly bag, renamed after Princess Grace Kelly in 1977, and the Birkin bag, conceived by Jean-Louis Dumas in 1984, are prime examples of **Veblen goods** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:02">[03:12:02]</a>.

[!NOTE] **Veblen Good Defined**
A Veblen good defies typical economic principles: as its price increases, demand for it also increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:20">[03:12:20]</a>. The price itself signals desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:39">[03:12:39]</a>.

Hermès intentionally sells Birkin bags below market-clearing price, creating scarcity and further desirability. This scarcity elevates the overall status of the brand and drives demand for other Hermès products, as customers purchase them to build relationships with the company in hopes of being allocated a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:39">[03:19:39]</a>. Hermès increases prices across its product range by about 7% per year, which is above inflation but not an egregious amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:31">[03:18:31]</a>, ensuring that the goods appreciate in value over time, making them feel like an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:25">[03:20:25]</a>.

### Branding vs. Marketing
Hermès maintains that it has "no marketing department" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>, asserting that everyone at the company is responsible for marketing. They spend only 4.5% of revenue on "communication" (marketing) compared to LVMH's 12% on advertising and promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:39">[03:30:39]</a>. Two-thirds of Hermès' communication budget is for events, not media buys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:26">[03:31:26]</a>.

Hermès avoids celebrity endorsements, unlike most other luxury brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:02">[03:33:02]</a>. Instead, celebrities pay full price for Hermès products, which is seen as a more powerful and authentic endorsement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:50">[03:33:50]</a>. The brand thrives on word-of-mouth and the lore surrounding its products, cultivating a global community that aspires to own Hermès <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:22">[03:34:22]</a>.

## Sales and Distribution

Hermès employs a "pull model" for merchandising its stores, allowing store managers to pick what is stocked for their local clientele, rather than headquarters dictating inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:58">[03:35:58]</a>. This ensures no two stores are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:38">[03:37:38]</a>. They have strict policies: no calling other stores to check stock, and no photos allowed in stores to prevent online flipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:50">[03:37:50]</a>.

Their e-commerce strategy is distinct: while they sell some items online, there's no buy button for Birkin bags, only an educational page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:56">[03:43:56]</a>. Online buyers are often new to Hermès <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:02">[03:39:02]</a>. Airport stores also serve as an approachable entry point for first-time buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:06">[03:40:06]</a>.

### Controversial Partnerships
The partnership with Apple for the Apple Watch band, launched in 2015, is seen as a compromise to Hermès' traditional stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:48">[03:00:48]</a>. While the bands are elegant, they are machine-made and priced significantly lower than other Hermès leather goods (e.g., $540 for a band vs. $640 for a luggage tag) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:05">[03:01:05]</a>. This lower price point and mass-market association feel like a "profanity" to some, defying Hermès' usual extreme luxury positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

## Responsible Growth and Future

Hermès' strategy has three pillars: "creation, craftsmanship, and an exclusive distribution network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:37">[03:43:37]</a>. This commitment to their unique model has resulted in incredible financial success, with revenues growing from under $100 million when Jean-Louis Dumas took over in 1978 to $14 billion (Euros) in the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:09">[03:05:09]</a>.

[!INFO] **Key Metrics (Last 12 Months)**
*   Revenue: €14 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:09">[03:05:09]</a>
*   Operating Income: €5.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:45">[03:42:45]</a>
*   Gross Margin: 71% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:50">[03:42:50]</a>

*   Employees: 21,000 (7,000 artisans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:27">[03:13:27]</a>
*   Annual Employee Turnover: 6% (4.5% voluntary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:53">[03:40:53]</a>

Hermès' success in scaling traditional methods, such as the saddle stitch, stands in stark contrast to other brands that have embraced mass production. This "rate-limited flywheel" ensures exclusivity and maintains the brand's unique allure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:26">[02:54:26]</a>. The company aims to perpetuate this by ensuring the business remains "fun" for the family, prioritizing identity and long-term vision over short-term financial maximization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:14">[03:55:14]</a>.

> "The luxury industry is built on a paradox: the more desirable a brand becomes, the more it sells; but the more it sells, the less desirable it becomes. I believe Hermès' vision provides a solution to this dilemma." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:44">[02:45:44]</a>

This [[lessons_from_successful_company_strategies | strategy]] of intentional scarcity and unparalleled quality ensures that Hermès and Louis Vuitton, though both from France and connected to Empress Eugénie, are two entirely different businesses built around the same product category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:21">[03:29:21]</a>. Hermès sells a unique bundle of exclusivity, service, craftsmanship, shopping experience, and a great brand, a bundle not easily replicated by competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:22">[03:44:22]</a>.

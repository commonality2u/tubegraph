This article covers the early [[history of Standard Oil | history and facts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> of Standard Oil, focusing on its growth and monopolistic practices up to 1890 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> and the early stages of its [[legal and regulatory challenges faced by Standard Oil | legal and regulatory challenges]].

## Introduction
Standard Oil was an oil monopoly founded in the 1870s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> by [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]], who became the wealthiest person in modern human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> before gasoline became the primary use for oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The company primarily dealt with kerosene for lamps until much later in its life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Standard Oil predates the Ford Model T by about 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Despite being famously broken up, remnants of Standard Oil are still present today, including Exxon and Mobile, Marathon, Amoco (now part of BP), and Chevron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This episode delves into the company's early history up to the Sherman Antitrust Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Roots of [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]]
The story of [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] transports to a time when industrial capitalism was raw and new in America, and "the rules of the game were unwritten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Standard Oil effectively wrote these unwritten rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Early Life and Family Influences
[[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] was born on July 8, 1839 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, in Richford, New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. His parents were William Avery Rockefeller, known as "Big Bill" or "Devil Bill," and Eliza Davison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

*   **William "Devil Bill" Rockefeller:** Born in 1810 in Ancram, New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, he was literally a snake oil salesman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. He would pretend to be deaf to gauge people's character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. He had a "sensual love of cash" and enjoyed flashing plump rolls of bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] admired his father's ability to make money and would intensely defend him throughout his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Eliza Davison:** From a wealthy, upstanding, and devout Baptist family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The Baptists believed money was good for spreading influence and recruiting followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. This profoundly impacted [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]], who stated, "I believe the power to make money is a gift from God... I believe it is my duty to make money and still more money and to use the money I make for the good of my fellow man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. This intertwining of business and philanthropy was central to his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### Move to Ohio and Early Career
In 1853, when [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] was 14, his father moved the family from New York to Strongsville, Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, near Cleveland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This move was partly to expand his father's business and partly to create distance from another girlfriend in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

At 16, [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] was deputized as head of the household by his father and had to drop out of school to support the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. He paid $40 for a three-month crash course in bookkeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. He then sought employment by targeting businesses with the best credit ratings in Cleveland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. After six weeks of pounding the pavement and being rejected, he secured a junior bookkeeper position at Hewitt and Tuttle, a merchant trading firm specializing in produce commodities, on September 26, 1855 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. He famously celebrated this "Job Day" more sacredly than his birthday for the rest of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

[[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] excelled as a bookkeeper, quickly earning a 50% raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. He had an "almost mystic faith in numbers" and considered ledgers sacred books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. In 1858, at age 18, he partnered with a much older gentleman named Maurice Clark to form Clark and Rockefeller, a merchant firm trading in foodstuffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>, investing $2,000 of his own capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

### The Civil War Boom and Entry into Oil
The American Civil War, starting in 1861 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>, proved to be a significant boon for commodity prices, especially foodstuffs, as armies needed supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. In 1862, Clark and Rockefeller made a trading profit of $17,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>, four times their earnings from all previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

During this time, people in Cleveland started hearing about oil discoveries in Titusville, Western Pennsylvania, which for decades was the center of the world's oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. The oil was refined into kerosene, primarily used for lamps in cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. Kerosene was significantly cheaper and more plentiful than whale oil, which was facing shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

A chemist named Samuel Andrews, who knew how to refine oil in cities, approached Clark and Rockefeller for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. While Clark was hesitant due to lack of cash, [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] saw the opportunity and invested $4,000 on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. Later that year, they opened the Excelsior Works refinery in the Flats area of Cleveland, strategically located with access to the Cuyahoga River and rail lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## [[Impact of Standard Oils monopolistic practices | Monopolistic Practices]] and Consolidation
[[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] became obsessed with efficiency in the refinery, constantly tweaking the process and focusing on profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Unlike other refiners who saw it as a "gold rush," he thought long-term, buying crude when prices crashed and making his operations more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

### Vertical and Horizontal Integration
Standard Oil pursued both vertical and horizontal integration:
*   **Vertical Integration:** They hired their own plumbers and blacksmiths to save costs on piping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. They even bought forests to cut down trees and build their own barrels, innovating the process to reduce transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   **Horizontal Integration:** They sought to use all byproducts of the refining process. They commercialized petroleum jelly (Vaseline) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a> and found new markets for every little byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. They also ran their factories on gasoline byproduct, using less coal than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.

### The Purchase of Clark's Share and Renaming to Standard Oil
Clark was unnerved by [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]]'s aggressive capital ties and bank loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] engineered a coup, baiting Clark and his brothers into threatening to dissolve the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. He then immediately placed a notice in the local paper for an auction of the partnership's assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.

With pre-arranged financing, [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] bought Clark's 50% share of the oil business for $72,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a> in February 1865 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. This happened two months before General Lee surrendered, ending the Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. With the war over, the oil industry's importance surged due to urbanization and industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>, and kerosene became an economic staple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>.

In December 1865 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>, [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] opened a second refinery, the Standard Works, signaling his intent to set the quality and operational "standard" for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.

### The Role of Henry Flagler and Railroad Deals
In 1866, Standard Oil was already selling two-thirds of its kerosene overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]]'s brother, William, was dispatched to New York City to handle the export business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.

Henry Morrison Flagler joined Standard Oil, bringing with him a $100,000 investment from his wealthy relative, Stephen Harkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. Flagler, serving as treasurer, was a ruthless negotiator. His desk quote was, "Do unto others as they would do unto you, and do it first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

Flagler took over negotiations with railroads. Previously, [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] used Cleveland's access to Lake Erie as leverage for good shipping rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. Flagler proposed guaranteeing a large volume of minimum oil shipments to the three biggest railroads (Pennsylvania, New York Central, and Erie) in exchange for unbelievably low rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. This allowed railroads to run dedicated oil tank car lines with no stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>, significantly reducing their operating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. Standard Oil also pioneered the use of metal tank cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.

Flagler then approached other Cleveland refiners, presenting a deal where they could pool their shipments to get the same great rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>. This was a "gentleman's agreement" with no written documentation to avoid federal scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. This agreement, known as the Lakeshore Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>, made Cleveland the number one oil refining center in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.

### The South Improvement Company and Cleveland Massacre
To expand control beyond Ohio, Standard Oil needed a structure to operate across state lines and acquire other companies, which was not legally possible for corporations at the time <a class="yt-yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. Flagler devised a plan using a joint stock company structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>, which could buy and sell shares in other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. On January 10, 1870, the partnership was abolished, and its assets were poured into the new Standard Oil Company of Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>, capitalized with $1 million in liquid assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.

To further consolidate, they created the **Standard Oil Trust** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>. This trust would hold shares in companies across the country, with trustees (Standard Oil officers) dictating how these corporations would operate. Dividends from all subsidiary companies flowed directly to the individual shareholders of Standard Oil of Ohio, bypassing the company itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. This was a groundbreaking financial and corporate law innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>, effectively giving them national reach. In its first year, the trust paid a 105% dividend while reinvesting massive cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.

In 1871, Standard Oil and the three major railroads formed a shell corporation called the South Improvement Company (SIC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>.
The SIC agreement dictated:
1.  All railroads would set a new, very high fixed price for shipping oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:58">[01:24:58]</a>.
2.  Members of the SIC (primarily Standard Oil) would receive a 50% discount on this fixed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:12">[01:25:12]</a>.
3.  SIC members would also receive a "drawback" or kickback from the revenue generated by other oil producers who shipped on the railroads but were *not* part of the cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>. This meant competitors were literally paying Standard Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>.

News of this deal spread, causing "literal rioting in the streets" in Titusville <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a>. While the railroads hesitated, Standard Oil used the threat of the SIC to approach other refiners in Cleveland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>. They presented an ultimatum: sell their operations to Standard Oil for 25-50% of book value in cash or stock, or face ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:18">[01:31:18]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] argued he was doing them a favor, as most would go out of business anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. This period, from February to April 1872 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>, saw Standard Oil acquire 22 of the 26 other refineries in Cleveland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:59">[01:31:59]</a>, an event known as the **Cleveland Massacre** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>.

The SIC agreement was never formally implemented or used for shipments; its purpose was solely leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:38">[01:32:38]</a>. After Cleveland, Standard Oil used the same tactic to consolidate refiners in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and West Virginia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>. By 1877, Standard Oil controlled 90% of the oil business in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>.

### Control over Transportation and Distribution
Standard Oil's power extended to controlling the transportation network. They began to manufacture their own tank cars and lease them to the railroads at low rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:59">[01:35:59]</a>. This gave Standard Oil unassailable leverage: they could crush a railroad by threatening to withdraw their tank cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:20">[01:36:20]</a>.

They also co-opted the emerging pipeline technology. In 1877, independent refiners formed the Tidewater Pipeline Company to build a long-distance pipeline from Titusville to Williamsport, Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. Standard Oil fought them politically but failed to stop the pipeline from turning on in 1879 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]]'s counter-plan was to instruct his railroad allies to cut shipping rates so low on that line that using the pipeline became uneconomical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a>. By March 1880, Tidewater Pipeline Company was forced to sell a minority stake to Standard Oil, giving them control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>. Standard Oil then built four more major pipelines, often on land leased from railroads, as a constant reminder to the railroads of their dispensability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:30">[01:43:30]</a>.

Standard Oil also controlled distribution to customers. In the early 1880s, they dictated that all kerosene be sold in their standardized canisters at fixed prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:18">[01:46:18]</a>. They sent letters to grocers, threatening to open their own grocery store chains and sell goods at cost if stores refused to comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>.

## Public Opinion and the Sherman Antitrust Act
By the mid-1880s, Standard Oil was the "biggest and richest, the most feared and most admired business organization in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:26">[01:47:26]</a>. In 1883, official Standard Oil headquarters moved to 26 Broadway in Manhattan, New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>.

Despite providing consumers with consistent, cheaper, and higher-quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:38">[01:58:38]</a>, public sentiment, fueled by competitors and those coerced into cooperation, began to turn against the "Standard Oil octopus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>.

Ohio Senator John Sherman, brother of General William Tecumseh Sherman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:14">[01:52:14]</a>, proposed an anti-trust bill in 1889 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:43">[01:52:43]</a>. This was despite [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] being one of his biggest campaign supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>. The Sherman Antitrust Act passed in July 1890 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:32">[01:53:32]</a>, outlawing "trusts and business combinations... in restraint of trade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:46">[01:53:46]</a>. However, it did not define "in restraint of trade," leading Standard Oil to initially view it as a superficial win that would appease the public without curtailing their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:20">[01:54:20]</a>. Indeed, [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] was again one of Sherman's biggest donors for his re-election in 1891 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>.

## Legacy (Part 1)
[[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] effectively retired in 1896 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:18">[01:55:18]</a> to focus on his [[john_d_rockefellers_legacy_and_philanthropy | philanthropy]], leaving lieutenants and his son, [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] Jr., in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>. However, he remained chairman in title, and the public continued to associate him with the company, leading to future legal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:58">[01:55:58]</a>.

At its peak, Standard Oil employed 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:01">[02:18:01]</a>. In the mid-1880s, it paid dividends of 50% to 200% annually to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:22">[02:18:22]</a>. By 1900, Standard Oil's annual earnings were 60 million dollars, representing 0.25% of the entire country's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:10">[02:23:10]</a>. The immense value tied up in Standard Oil is evidenced by the scale of the companies that emerged from its [[the_breakup_of_standard_oil | breakup]], such as ExxonMobil, which was the world's largest market cap company before the rise of tech giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>.

Standard Oil's strategies of massive fixed costs and volume to drastically slash unit costs were a precursor to modern venture capital and "strength leads to strength" business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:09">[02:14:09]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] believed that consolidating the industry, though seemingly anti-competitive, was for the "general good" and a "moral imperative" to provide cheaper, higher-quality products to the public and stabilize the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:25">[02:01:25]</a>. He argued that unfettered competition would lead to chaos and ruin, preventing the industry from reaching its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:02:04]</a>.

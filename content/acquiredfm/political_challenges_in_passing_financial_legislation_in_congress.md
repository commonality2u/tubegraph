A member of the House Financial Services Committee estimates that approximately one-third of their term is spent on crypto-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Beyond cryptocurrency, the committee member's primary focus areas have been [[congressional_focus_on_financial_institutions_and_china | China work]] and capital markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Key Areas of Congressional Focus

A significant portion of time during the first year in Congress was dedicated to [[congressional_focus_on_financial_institutions_and_china | China work]], specifically reforming [[congressional_focus_on_financial_institutions_and_china | International financial institutions]] like the World Bank and the IMF, which have been significantly influenced by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Substantial effort was put into advocating for reforms in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The three primary areas of focus for the committee member have been:
*   **China** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   **Capital markets**, particularly addressing the GameStop [[disappointment_in_legislative_outcomes_from_meme_stock_hearings | Meme stock craze]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Crypto** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

## Case Study: The Meme Stock Phenomenon and Legislative Outcomes

Despite extensive work, including four hearings and significant national media attention, no meaningful legislation resulted from the [[disappointment_in_legislative_outcomes_from_meme_stock_hearings | meme stock mania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The committee member expressed disappointment that legislative outcomes did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Challenges in Bipartisan Legislation
A key proposed measure was to shorten the settlement time for trades from two days to one day, which would have reduced systemic risk and potentially prevented situations like Robinhood halting trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, instead of passing this potentially bipartisan bill, the Democrats, according to the committee member, bundled it with other long-standing legislative desires into a single bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This bill passed the House but is not expected to advance in the Senate, resulting in no change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The committee member noted this isn't partisan, stating Republicans would likely do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Political Casualties and Frustration
The failure to pass effective legislation is attributed to Washington's political frustrations, where issues often become "political casualties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This outcome was particularly frustrating for the committee member because significant work, including multiple hearings, was put into understanding the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Public Engagement and Reaction
The meme stock hearings were notably engaging, even followed live by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. During a remote hearing, the committee member simultaneously monitored the Wall Street Bets forum on a personal computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Members of Congress speaking during the hearing were "absolutely eviscerated" by comments on the forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, with the committee member even being compared to "Hitman" characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

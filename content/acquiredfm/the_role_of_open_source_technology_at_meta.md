Open source technology has played a vital role in the development and success of Meta, formerly known as Facebook. During a live interview at the Chase Center, [[mark_zuckerbergs_reflections_on_facebooks_past_and_mistakes | Mark Zuckerberg]], CEO of Meta, discussed the significant impact and strategic importance of open source for the company. Here, we delve into how Meta has benefited from and contributed to the open source community.

## Meta's Foundation on Open Source

Meta was one of the first major companies built on the LAMP stack—Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP—an open source software stack that facilitated rapid development and iteration. Zuckerberg acknowledged this foundational choice as crucial in Meta's ability to scale quickly and efficiently, stating, "We wouldn't have been able to get built without open source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.

## Sequential Development and Strategic Release

Zuckerberg highlighted an interesting dynamic in Meta’s approach to open source versus proprietary development, explaining that the company came after Google, which had developed proprietary distributed computing infrastructure first. Recognizing that keeping this technology proprietary wouldn't provide a competitive edge against Google, Meta opted to release its technology as open source, fostering a wider community of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

He cited the example of [[metas_strategy_for_future_technologies_such_as_ar_and_ai | Open Compute]], Meta's initiative to develop and share efficient server designs. By making these designs open source, Meta not only helped set industry standards but also stimulated a broader ecosystem while benefiting from improved supply chain efficiency and substantial cost savings.

## Open Source in AI Development

The significance of open source continues with Meta's strategies in artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg confirmed Meta's commitment to open source by releasing its AI models publicly, which he described as an ecosystem that "gets better when other people use them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

By choosing to open its AI models, Meta not only aligns with a philosophical stance against the limitations imposed by proprietary platforms but also benefits from a community-driven approach to [[ai_and_machine_learning_advancements | innovation and improvement]]. This decision resonates with Meta's broader mission to foster a more open and connected world, empowering developers globally to contribute to and build upon Meta's work.

## Balancing Open and Closed Source

Despite its heavy reliance on open source, Meta does not shy away from using closed source strategies where appropriate. Zuckerberg stressed that while open source forms a critical part of Meta’s technology strategy, the company balances it with proprietary solutions when they offer strategic advantages. This pragmatic approach ensures Meta can leverage the strengths of open collaboration while protecting its competitive edges where necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Open source technology has been and continues to be a cornerstone of Meta's growth and innovation. By utilizing and contributing to open source, Meta has effectively expanded its technological capabilities and rallied a global community around its platforms. This strategy not only showcases the power of open collaboration but also positions Meta as a leader in shaping the future of technology.

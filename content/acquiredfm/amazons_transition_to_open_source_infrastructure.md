Amazon's infrastructure historically relied on proprietary, high-margin servers from companies like Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), specifically DEC Alpha servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. These were highly bundled hardware-software platforms, leased from manufacturers, with significant markups and gross margins of around 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This monolithic structure meant that the [[amazons_founding_and_early_years | amazon.com]] codebase was installed directly on these owned servers, making it impossible to simply "rent out" unused capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## The Impact of Linux and Open Source

A pivotal shift occurred with the advent of Linux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Linux, as an open-source operating system, allowed companies to move away from expensive Unix workstations and run applications on more affordable, diverse hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This development laid the groundwork for infrastructure to become less expensive and challenged the traditional profit pools held by companies like DEC, Oracle, and IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

### Financial Imperative for Change

By 2000, [[amazons_ipo_and_subsequent_challenges | Amazon]] faced severe financial constraints, almost going out of business due to high infrastructure spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The move to the open-source ecosystem, coupled with a massive rewrite of the [[amazons_founding_and_early_years | amazon.com]] platform to run on Linux and HP servers (instead of DEC), became a crucial cost-saving measure that effectively "saved the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Beyond the "Excess Capacity Myth"

Despite the widespread "excess capacity" narrative often associated with the origin of [[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]], this transition to open-source infrastructure was a strategic and intentional move, not a spontaneous byproduct of spare server capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. As [[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]] CTO (and later Amazon CTO) Werner Vogels clarified in a 2011 Quora post:

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a> "The excess capacity story is a myth. It was never a matter of selling excess capacity. Actually, within two months after launch, [[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]] would have already burned through the excess amazon.com. [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon Web Services]] was always considered a business by itself with the expectation that it could even grow as big as the [[amazons_founding_and_early_years | amazon.com]] retail operation."

Amazon always viewed technology as an investment, not a cost center, anticipating advancements like Moore's Law to drive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. The shift to open source was part of an "incredibly intentional strategy" to create a new market rather than merely monetize idle resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. This foundational change in infrastructure paved the way for the future development of [[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]] and its [[aws_business_strategy | business strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

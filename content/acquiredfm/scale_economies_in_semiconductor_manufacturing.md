[[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC|TSMC]]'s strategy often involves forgoing current profits for future gains, aiming for increased future revenues through customer retention and acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach prompts an inquiry into whether higher customer numbers and revenue in the future will yield greater differential returns, leading to a discussion on scale economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While scale economies are present in the semiconductor industry, they are considered to be of a "pretty unusual type" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Unusual Industry Characteristics Driving Scale Economies

Several unique characteristics distinguish the [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc|semiconductor industry]]'s scale economies:

### Lumpy Capital Investment
The industry requires exceptionally large and lumpy capital investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For instance, a new fabrication plant (fab) can cost $10 billion or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Predictable Performance Advances
Unlike most industries, the [[the_evolution_of_the_semiconductor_industry|semiconductor industry]] benefits from "predictable material performance advances," primarily governed by [[evolution_of_moores_law_and_advanced_chip_design|Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This means companies can have a high assurance that making the right [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement|technology choices]] could lead to a 10x improvement in performance within 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Such predictability is highly unusual in other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Reliance on Upstream Suppliers
Technological advantages in the [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc|semiconductor industry]] are significantly driven by [[influence_of_upstream_suppliers_like_asml_on_semiconductor_technology|upstream suppliers]] such as [[influence_of_upstream_suppliers_like_asml_on_semiconductor_technology|ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Decisions related to these supplier relationships can be challenging; historically, [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc|semiconductor companies]] engaged in extensive discussions, for example, regarding the adoption of x-ray lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

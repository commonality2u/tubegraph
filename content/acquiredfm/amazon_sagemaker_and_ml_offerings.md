Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a significant pillar of Amazon's business, standing alongside compute and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While new database offerings are announced annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, ML has gained prominence with dedicated announcements and services.

## Key ML Offerings

[[Amazons investment in machine learning | Amazon's investment in machine learning]] is evident through several initiatives:
*   **Sagemaker**: Amazon has announced Sagemaker as a key ML offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Keynotes**: The company now features a custom ML keynote at its events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Cloud-Hosted Services**: [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] provides a wide range of cloud-hosted ML offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **TensorFlow Support**: [[Amazons transition to open source infrastructure | AWS]] runs TensorFlow, an ML framework originally created by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Container Services**: [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] offers its own custom Amazon Container Service (ECS) while also providing Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to serve customers who prefer Kubernetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Despite supporting Kubernetes, Amazon aims to encourage the use of their proprietary ECS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Strategic Positioning of ML Capabilities

Amazon's strategy regarding its machine learning capabilities is closely tied to its dominance in data storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Importance of Data Locality
> Running machine learning models near the data is considered the most critical factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

This means that while Amazon's ML capabilities need to be competent, they do not necessarily need to surpass those of competitors like Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Once a customer has chosen [[Amazon Web Services AWS | Amazon]] as their storage vendor and migrated their data to [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] data centers, they are unlikely to seek out other providers for ML services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Customers will typically run their ML workloads on [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Therefore, although [[Comparison of Amazon and Google ML capabilities | Google may be better positioned]] to offer superior ML capabilities, it "kind of doesn't matter" if customers are not storing their data with Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This highlights [[Amazons strategy in cloud storage and machine learning | Amazon's strategic advantage]] in the ML space, leveraging its position as a primary data storage provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. While [[Amazon Web Services AWS | Amazon]] cannot afford to fall significantly behind in ML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, its core strength lies in its expansive data storage infrastructure.

Twitter's current state is significantly different from its past, largely because users are now "scared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This shift is attributed to fundamental design choices that impacted the platform's nature.

## The Intended Nature of Twitter

Ideally, Twitter "should have had disappearing tweets from day one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. It was envisioned as a "just in the moment sort of Social Network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, where content would be transient and impermanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This approach reflects a broader understanding of the [[impact_of_platform_and_tech_infrastructure_on_growth | nature of the internet]] as being transient, not permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## A Critical Misstep: Persistent Tweets

One of the biggest mistakes Twitter made was not implementing disappearing tweets from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This decision, while perhaps understandable at the time given that "no one could have seen it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, created long-term issues.

## Impact of the Archive

The permanent archive of tweets has had several negative consequences:
*   **Fear and Ruin** Users experience Twitter as an "in the moment product" but are then "stuck with this archive that induces fear, induces ruin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Reduced Authenticity** The archive "reduces the facade of what it's like to be on Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, making users less willing to engage freely.
*   **Decline in Quality** The speaker states this is "a big reason why Twitter is not what it used to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> because "people are scared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Suggested Remedial Action

Despite the current state, it is suggested that Twitter "should still do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> implement disappearing tweets. This would align the platform more closely with its perceived ephemeral nature and potentially alleviate the issues stemming from content permanence, offering a [[lessons_from_the_history_of_technology_companies | lesson for other platforms]] in [[the_challenges_and_opportunities_in_content_creation_and_distribution | content creation and distribution]].

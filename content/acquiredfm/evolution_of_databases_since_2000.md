In 2000, the database sector was the largest segment of software, with the aggregate enterprise value of companies primarily deriving revenue from databases estimated at approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. At this time, a guiding principle among some in the tech industry was that "not all software is created equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Drivers for Change

The subsequent evolution of the database market has been significantly influenced by two key factors:

1.  **Exponential Data Growth**
    Since 2000, there has been an unprecedented increase in [[impact of data accumulation on technology | data accumulation]], with more data being produced annually than in all preceding years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This ever-increasing volume of data requires a scalable and efficient "home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, especially as the future promises even more data gathered through advanced sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

2.  **Vision for Data-Driven Decision Making**
    Around 2000, Bill Gates articulated a transformative vision for the future of data. When asked if "all the interesting stuff" in computing was already done, Gates emphasized the "barbaric" nature of current decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He predicted a future where vast amounts of data would be stored, and machines would analyze this data to facilitate better decisions across various domains, including:
    *   Diagnosing illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
    *   Educating dyslexic children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
    *   Maintaining aircraft engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
    This vision underscored the necessity for robust and intelligent database systems capable of handling and processing massive datasets for analytical purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Shift to Cloud-Based Databases

Given these drivers, there was a strong conviction that the entire database market would be "remade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The prevailing view was that this transformation would occur specifically in the [[cloudbased database market | cloud]], with databases being "purpose built for the cloud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Consequently, significant focus was placed on developing the infrastructure layer within the [[cloudbased database market | cloud]] to enable enterprises to migrate their operations and data to cloud environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This strategic focus proved to be highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, validating the prediction of a fundamental shift in how databases are developed, deployed, and utilized.

The podcast *Acquired*, hosted by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, is dedicated to exploring the history, strategy, and stories behind prominent technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While their primary focus is on deep dives into companies like Nvidia, Sony, TSMC, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, they also occasionally venture beyond technology, covering topics such as Berkshire Hathaway, the NFL, or even Taylor Swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A key component of their content often involves direct conversations with significant individuals.

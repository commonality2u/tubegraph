Launching a new business, especially one with an unproven [[Subscription business model in internet media | subscription]] model, presents significant challenges requiring constant adaptation. The initial stages are often marked by skepticism, product failures, and financial strain, necessitating rapid pivots and a deep understanding of customer psychology.

## Overcoming Initial Skepticism and Product Failures

When launching a [[Subscription business model in internet media | subscription]]-based online business, the prevailing sentiment in the early 2010s, even among venture capitalists (VCs), was that [[Subscription business model in internet media | subscriptions]] were not a viable model on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This skepticism was initially confirmed by the product's poor performance.

### Disastrous Launch and Immediate Product Pivot
The initial launch of the product, Stratechery, was plagued with technical issues and design flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   A security certificate error prevented any purchases for the first 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   An "artificial deadline" set by a pre-scheduled announcement from a tech journalist added unnecessary pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   The product itself was confusing and failed to deliver a good experience for both paying and non-paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Initial subscriber goals (one-day, one-week, one-month) were significantly missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Recognizing that "the [[platform_business_models | business model]]'s right, the product's wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, the entire new website was torn down over a weekend and reverted to the old format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The pivot involved emailing subscribers the promised "extra stuff" daily, shifting the primary delivery mechanism from a complex website experience to a simpler email-first approach, with website archiving as a secondary option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Financial Strain and Personal Commitment
During this turbulent period, the founder faced substantial financial pressure, including business school debt and giving up a six-figure job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This led to extreme measures such as stopping credit card payments to preserve cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The workload was immense, involving writing seven times a week, producing and editing a podcast, and handling customer support and refunds due to double-charging errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Despite these challenges, a sense of pride and an unwillingness to "bail" due to the initial skepticism from others fueled perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Finding Early Traction and Adapting the Business Model

After the initial struggles, the business began to show signs of life. Monthly subscriber numbers, though small, started increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Simplification and Psychological Barriers
The business model was further simplified by reducing multiple pricing tiers to a single price point and one product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

A significant breakthrough in subscriber growth occurred when it became clear the business would be an "ongoing entity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Many potential subscribers were hesitant to pay because they feared the venture would fail and they would lose their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Once stability was demonstrated, a surge of 250 new subscribers occurred in 24 hours, representing the biggest single "step change" in growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This highlighted the psychological aspect of customer trust in [[Subscription business model in internet media | subscription]] services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Evolution of Content Delivery
While initially "backed into" an email-first delivery due to website issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, email proved advantageous as a direct feed that people check daily, without needing permissions or contending with algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

The vision for Stratechery evolved into a publication that strives to make content as easy as possible to consume in various formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This included:
*   **Email:** The accidental initial pivot became a core delivery method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Website:** Retained as crucial for growth, discovery via social media, and sharing links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Podcast:** Articles could be consumed as podcasts, offering another feed that feels like a "push" notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **SMS and RSS:** Additional delivery methods for articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Leveraging the Subscription Model for Feedback and Stability

The [[Subscription business model in internet media | subscription]] model provides powerful benefits for content creators.

### Direct Feedback Mechanism
A key advantage is the direct [[Scaling and feedback mechanisms in subscription businesses | feedback mechanism]] provided by subscriber numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Unlike relying on social media engagement (which often represents a small, vocal minority) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, a rising subscriber count indicates that a large, often silent, audience values the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This direct financial validation incentivizes creators to focus on satisfying paying customers rather than chasing clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### Customer-Centric Approach and Niche Stability
The [[Subscription business model in internet media | subscription]] model allows a focus on serving existing customers and making their experience as good as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This includes implementing features like "tokenized" links in forwarded emails, allowing recipients to access one paid article deep, which aids in discovery and organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

As the subscriber base grows and becomes stable, it creates a "recurring revenue" stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, enabling the creator to:
*   Be less concerned about individual cancellations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   Filter out rude or disrespectful customers, even refunding their entire purchase and asking them not to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   Maintain editorial independence and avoid "pandering to your audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

The early timing of the launch, when there was less competition and prevailing opinions (e.g., Apple was "doomed") provided "lowest hanging fruit" for content topics, making it easier to attract an audience without being overly controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This allowed the business to reach a size where it became resilient to external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

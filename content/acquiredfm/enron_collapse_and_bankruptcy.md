The story of Enron, once the seventh-largest company in America by market capitalization, is revisited in 2022 due to uncanny parallels with the FTX collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Enron was heralded as a pioneer of a new business model during a new technology era, with executives enjoying friendships and public appearances with multiple U.S. presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The Houston Astros baseball stadium, Enron Field, bore its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Fortune Magazine named it the "Most Innovative Company" for six consecutive years, including 2001, the year it filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Less than a year after its stock hit an all-time high, Enron went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The parallels to FTX include being a financial trading company that became overleveraged, thought they could do no wrong, and got tangled in self-dealing to paper over problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Individuals profited richly while shareholders were unaware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The main difference is that Enron managed to operate as a public company in plain daylight with much bigger dollar amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Kurt Eichenwald, author of *Conspiracy of Fools*, describes the Enron story as "more than the tale of one company's fall from grace" but rather "the story of a wrenching period of Economic and political tumult" in America at the turn of the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This type of scandal can only occur "to this height in a bull market" where capital saturates opportunities, leading people to take significant risks in search of returns and fostering a "FOMO" environment where investors lose incentive to ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Enron's Origins: Deregulation and Innovation
The origins of Enron trace back to the 1970s and a series of oil and energy crises, starting with the 1973 OPEC oil embargo that tripled energy prices and led to a massive recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Unemployment hit 10%, and CPI inflation was above 5% for most of the decade, peaking at 12.4% in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. In response, the U.S. government began [[enron_business_practices | deregulating]] energy markets in the mid-1970s, shifting away from the regulated monopoly structure that followed [[the_breakup_of_standard_oil | the breakup of Standard Oil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. President Jimmy Carter signed the National Energy Act in 1978, which started opening up parts of the energy economy to free market competition, with natural gas being the first deregulated area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Ken Lay's Early Career and Market Innovation
[[ken_lay_and_jeff_skilling | Kenneth Lee Lay]] was born in rural Missouri in 1942, growing up poor but believing in education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. He attended the University of Missouri, where he developed a passion for economics, eventually earning a PhD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. He worked in the oil industry and, in the mid-1970s, joined the federal power commission as Deputy Under Secretary of Energy in the Department of the Interior, precisely when deregulation began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

After a few years in government, Lay moved to Florida Gas, a pipeline company, as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. In 1982, Lay joined Transco Energy in Houston, the "Silicon Valley of the oil and gas sector" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. As energy prices fell for the first time in a decade, Lay, using his economics expertise, proposed setting up a trading market for oil and gas, particularly for deregulated natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. This innovation allowed producers and consumers to trade directly on a spot market at real-time prices, rather than relying on long-term contracts with pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This "massive innovation" established Lay as an industry legend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

In June 1984, Lay was poached to become CEO of Houston Natural Gas (HNG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

### Merger and Rebranding
In 1985, HNG merged with InterNorth, the largest pipeline company in America, based in Omaha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. The [[merger_of_houston_natural_gas_and_internorth | merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth]] was partly a defense against corporate raider Irwin Jacobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. InterNorth acquired HNG for $2.3 billion, a 40% premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. Although InterNorth was the larger company, Lay and the HNG team were clearly set to run the combined entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. A culture clash emerged, particularly over the headquarters location, with InterNorth favoring Omaha and Lay pushing for Houston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

To resolve the headquarters debate, the company hired McKinsey & Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. The assignment landed on the desk of [[kenneth_lays_relationship_with_mckinsey_and_jeffrey_skilling | Jeffrey Skilling]], a "young hotshot superstar Junior partner" from McKinsey's Houston office, who had a reputation for being "effing smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>. Skilling presented his findings, arguing that Houston was the logical choice for the largest pipeline company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

Natural gas was seen as the "next great frontier of pseudo clean energy," driving interest in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. At the board meeting in Omaha, Lay engineered a coup, becoming CEO of the combined company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. Lay and Skilling met for the first time, and Lay invited Skilling to lead strategic initiatives for the new company as their McKinsey partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

Lay decided to rename the company, disliking "HNG InterNorth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. They hired expensive naming and branding consultants, who initially proposed "Enteron" (a portmanteau of energy and InterNorth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. However, "enteron" is a medical term meaning "the intestinal digestive tract of a living creature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. Public ridicule led Lay to demand a new name, resulting in "Enron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. The famous Enron logo, designed by the legendary Paul Rand, was his last before he died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

### Early Warning Signs: The First Trading Scandal
Soon after the merger, Enron faced its first trading scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. Two traders in New York embezzled money through fake trades, tax returns, and bank accounts, including one named "Mr. M. Yass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. Enron's auditors, Arthur Andersen, recommended firing them, but Lay resisted, citing their trading prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. Lay's decision allowed them to continue, and they subsequently racked up almost a billion dollars in trading losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. This time, Lay fired them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>, and the trading floor managed to reduce the reported losses to less than $100 million, allowing the company to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

## Rise of Financial Innovations and Fraud
[[financial_innovations_and_fraud | Financial innovations and fraud]] became central to Enron's business model. While originally a logistics company, traders were initially brought in to match supply and demand, quoting spreads to make profit on transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. This marked the beginning of Enron as both a logistics and a "proto financial institution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

### "Bank for Gas" and Mark-to-Market Accounting
Skilling, still at McKinsey, proposed a brilliant idea: Enron becoming a "bank for gas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. This meant buying future production from producers, repackaging it, and reselling it to consumers on various timelines and terms, essentially creating a [[financial_innovations_and_fraud | securitization]] and derivatives market for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. This enabled "true futures contracts" for natural gas, allowing utilities to hedge price risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>. Enron pioneered the market for "energy derivatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>.

To bootstrap this market, Enron began funding producers and drillers, financing their exploration and drilling in exchange for rights to securitize future production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. This strategy of using capital to incentivize ecosystem participation is not inherently malicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.

In 1990, Lay and Vice Chairman Rich Kinder convinced Skilling to leave McKinsey and become CEO of the new Enron Finance division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. A telling condition for Skilling's joining was his insistence that Enron adopt Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

#### Mark-to-Market Accounting: A "License to Steal"
MTM accounting, typically used in financial trading, allows companies to immediately recognize unrealized gains or losses based on current market values, rather than waiting for cash transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>. Enron became the first non-financial company to use this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. While seemingly legitimate for some assets, it opened the door to widespread abuse for an operating company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

Skilling convinced the SEC to approve MTM for Enron, a surprising decision given the SEC had initially rejected it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. The SEC's approval was notable as it involved an entity without an obvious conflict of interest, unlike Enron's auditors and lawyers who were financially incentivized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, received $50 million a year from Enron, half from audit and tax fees and half from consulting fees, creating immense pressure to keep the client happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.

Under MTM, Enron would sign a deal with a producer, inflate projections, and immediately recognize 20 years of projected cash flows as revenue, with minimal associated expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. Additionally, Enron would then "sell" these projects to [[financial_innovations_and_fraud | special purpose entities]] (SPEs), which allowed them to book these "phony sales" as additional revenue, effectively "double dipping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>. This was possible as long as at least 3% of the SPE's capital came from outside investors, despite Enron potentially owning 97% of the entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. Crucially, no cash actually changed hands in many of these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.

This system created a massive flaw: recognizing all future revenue today meant starting from zero the next year, forcing Enron to constantly seek bigger and more deals to show growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. The deals themselves became bad because everyone was incentivized to inflate numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

### The Rise of Andrew Fastow and LJM Funds
[[ken_lay_and_jeff_skilling | Skilling]] hired [[ken_lay_and_jeff_skilling | Andrew Fastow]], a former banker from Continental Illinois Bank (which had the largest bank failure in history until Washington Mutual in 2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. Fastow was tasked with structured financing, specifically packaging and offloading Enron's investments in producers to SPEs to keep them off Enron's books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.

In the mid-1990s, Skilling was promoted to President and CEO of Enron, with Lay transitioning to an "Elder Statesman" role, focusing on political connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>. Fastow became CFO of the entire company, and structured finance evolved into a profit-generating division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.

As Enron expanded globally, particularly in developing countries like India, Brazil, and Argentina, it financed multi-billion dollar energy projects, such as an LNG power plant in India that became a "smoking crater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. These projects, often co-development deals with governments, allowed Enron to book billions in revenue and offload assets, despite often having no real operational success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. Enron's ability to finance energy development internationally also provided political leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>.

The sheer volume of deals created a problem: finding enough outside investors for the 3% capital needed for SPEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. To solve this, Fastow and Skilling devised a "brilliant idea": create their own fund, part of the Enron "family" but separate and independent, to put up the 3% equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>. The board approved this, despite the obvious conflict of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>. Fastow, as General Partner, received 2% management fees and 20% of profits from these funds, eventually totaling hundreds of millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>. Since Enron paid all the expenses, the management fees flowed directly to Fastow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>.

Fastow named his suite of funds LJM Capital, after his wife, Leah, and children, Jeffrey and Matthew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:36">[01:20:36]</a>. The use of this name underscored who benefited from the scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. The funds became key to turbocharging the flywheel, getting bad assets off Enron's books, and booking revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. Major financial institutions like Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan were also involved, further incentivizing them for Enron's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>.

In 1999, Fastow campaigned to be named CFO of the Year by CFO Magazine, receiving an award for "CFO excellence in the category of capital structure management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>. Fastow's role expanded to head of Corporate Development, meaning he controlled both sides of the transactions between Enron and his funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The LJM funds: Fastow's decision to name the funds "LJM Capital" (after his wife and children) should have signaled the blatant conflict of interest and who was truly benefiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:36">[01:20:36]</a>.

### Power Trading and California Blackouts
Enron expanded into electricity trading in the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:19">[01:33:19]</a>. Unlike natural gas, electricity cannot be easily stored, making its market much harder to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>. Enron became a key player in the disastrous California blackouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Enron traders exploited loopholes in California's partially [[enron_business_practices | deregulated]] power markets through strategies with names like "Death Star" (filing imaginary transmission schedules to get paid for non-existent congestion), "Fat Boy" (submitting schedules for non-existent demand), "Get Shorty" (selling power Enron didn't have as reserves), and "Ricochet" (exporting power out of state and then selling it back at higher prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This market manipulation led to real-world harm, including blackouts, and contributed to the recall of California Governor Gray Davis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

### The "War Room" and Enron Online
In 1997, Enron Energy Services (EES) became a new focus for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. EES used a "War Room" to impress analysts, which was a "veritable sham" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:54">[01:40:54]</a>. The room was staged with Enron employees from other departments, including secretaries, who were told to look busy and even bring personal photos to make their desks look authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>.

Enron also ventured into bandwidth trading, becoming an "Internet company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. They even signed a deal with Blockbuster for a video-on-demand product that never launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:17">[01:42:17]</a>. Despite the service's failure, Enron booked over $100 million in revenue on day one and then offloaded the project to an SPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a>. Later, when the contract was terminated, they recognized an even larger positive revenue impact by claiming they now had the ability to do deals with anyone, effectively profiting from the *lack* of a contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>.

In November 1999, Enron launched Enron Online, an exchange that allowed counterparties to trade electronically, but Enron itself was the counterparty to every trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>. This gave Enron a "savvy data advantage" to manipulate markets and control commodity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:55">[01:45:55]</a>.

## The Beginning of the End
From 1996 to 2001, Enron's revenues grew 7.5x, from $13.3 billion to over $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. In 2000, Fortune Magazine named Enron "America's Best Managed Company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>. The company's slogan was "Ask Why," which became ironic as its finances grew impenetrable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:48">[01:52:48]</a>.

### Growing Scrutiny and Skilling's Outburst
In September 2000, short seller Jim Chanos began questioning Enron's fundamentals, noting the financial reports were "completely impartial" and questioning how Enron made money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This attracted journalists, including Bethany McLean from Fortune, who published "Is Enron Overpriced?" on March 5, 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>. The article highlighted Enron's complex businesses and impenetrable financial statements, questioning its high stock multiple compared to peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>. In March 2000, Enron traded at 55x trailing earnings, compared to Duke Energy at 2.5x and Goldman Sachs at 17x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:31">[01:53:31]</a>. Critics noted the lack of free cash flow and poor return on invested capital despite reported high revenue growth and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:17">[01:54:17]</a>.

On April 17, 2001, in his first earnings call as CEO, [[ken_lay_and_jeff_skilling | Jeff Skilling]] notoriously called analyst Richard Grubman an "asshole" for questioning why Enron, unlike 99% of other companies, only reported an income statement and not a balance sheet or cash flow statement simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:39">[01:57:39]</a>. Skilling later apologized, citing lack of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>.

### Skilling's Resignation and Executive Stock Sales
As the tech bubble burst and news of market manipulation emerged, Enron's stock fell from an all-time high of over $90 to the $40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:36">[01:59:36]</a>. This market downturn, akin to the tide going out, exposed companies with poor fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

In August 2001, Skilling resigned as CEO, citing personal reasons and claiming mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:21">[02:01:21]</a>. However, it is speculated that he foresaw the collapse and wanted to exit, immediately selling a significant amount of his Enron stock upon leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:57">[02:02:57]</a>. All executives, including Lay and Fastow, were selling stock at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:09">[02:03:09]</a>.

[[ken_lay_and_jeff_skilling | Ken Lay]] had been using margin loans against his Enron stock to invest in other things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:43">[02:03:43]</a>. As the stock collapsed, he faced margin calls and repaid them by taking cash loans from Enron, using his Enron stock as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>. This complex scheme allowed Lay to get cash out of Enron without publicly disclosing stock sales, which would have signaled trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:30">[02:05:30]</a>. Lay sold about $300 million worth of Enron stock, and Skilling sold about $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:21">[02:06:21]</a>. Fastow made $60 million from his LJM partnerships alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:34">[02:06:34]</a>.

## The Collapse
Upon Skilling's resignation, Lay returned as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:19">[02:09:19]</a>. He asked Fastow for a complete picture of Enron's debt obligations, including off-balance sheet entities, only to discover that the company's actual obligations were $34 billion, far exceeding the $12.8 billion reported on the balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:51">[02:09:51]</a>. Compounding this, Enron had no cash flow to service this debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:35">[02:10:35]</a>.

A VP in Corporate Development, Sharon Watkins, wrote an anonymous memo to Lay, later putting her name on it, stating, "I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>. Lay met with her but took no action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:20">[02:11:20]</a>.

### The Final Days
September 11, 2001, provided a temporary reprieve, distracting the public and press from Enron's issues and offering cover for the falling stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:41">[02:11:41]</a>. However, on September 12, Enron's commercial paper (overnight loans for daily cash obligations) failed to turn over, meaning no buyers were willing to repurchase them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:09">[02:12:09]</a>. This was a critical sign of impending doom, but the post-9/11 distraction delayed the inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:35">[02:13:35]</a>.

By early October, the financial community resumed its scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:55">[02:13:55]</a>. The Wall Street Journal published stories on the LJM funds and Fastow's potential earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:06">[02:14:06]</a>. Arthur Andersen, fearing an investigation, began a massive document shredding operation on October 12, sending an email directing the destruction of "non-finalized documents" related to Enron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:16">[02:14:16]</a>. This effort involved shredding a ton of paper daily for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:54">[02:15:54]</a>.

On October 16, Enron reported $638 million in losses and announced a restatement of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity related to "improper accounting of off books entities," including the Raptor entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:53">[02:17:53]</a>. These Raptors were off-balance sheet vehicles used to hide losses and debt, and their underlying collateral was Enron stock itself, exacerbating exposure to market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:02">[02:19:02]</a>.

The SEC announced an inquiry into Enron's accounting on October 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:42">[02:19:42]</a>. The next day, the board confronted Fastow, learning of his earnings from LJM, and promptly fired him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:49">[02:19:49]</a>. His replacement, Jeff McMahon, discovered that Fastow did not know the company's total debt, cash holdings, or debt maturity schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:10">[02:20:10]</a>.

With the company near insolvency and no cash flow, Enron pulled down all its revolving credit lines with banks, which totaled $3.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:12">[02:21:12]</a>. Despite a press release asserting strong financial footing, credit agencies immediately downgraded Enron's rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:57">[02:21:57]</a>.

Lay sought a bailout from the Bush Administration, but it was denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>. He then pursued a merger with Dynegy, Enron's largest competitor, to save the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:02">[02:23:02]</a>. Dynegy agreed to acquire Enron for $8 billion in an all-stock deal and lent Enron $1.5 billion in cash to help with liquidity, secured by Enron's core pipeline assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:02">[02:24:02]</a>. JPMorgan, involved in the loan, also mandated all future Enron investment banking business for 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:40">[02:24:40]</a>.

However, during due diligence, Arthur Andersen's review uncovered issues with the "Chuco" entity (short for Chewbacca), a front created by Fastow and his direct report, Michael Kopper, using Kopper's domestic partner, Bill Dodson, as the "outside investor" to buy out assets from CalPERS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a>. Andersen determined this was not independent, requiring a restatement of years of assets and liabilities back onto Enron's balance sheet, undoing MTM accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:52">[02:25:52]</a>. This led to a further liquidity crisis, quickly depleting the Dynegy loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:26">[02:26:26]</a>.

On November 28, 2001, Dynegy walked away from the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:25">[02:27:25]</a>. Ten minutes before the news hit the press, Ken Lay's wife sold 500,000 shares of Enron stock from the Lay Family Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:50">[02:27:50]</a>. The stock crashed to 61 cents a share from over $80 earlier that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:14">[02:28:14]</a>.

On December 2, 2001, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:17">[02:29:17]</a>, then the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:23">[02:29:23]</a>. It would be surpassed six months later by WorldCom, and since then by five other bankruptcies, including Lehman Brothers and GM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>.

## Aftermath and Consequences
The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>. Many executives, including Michael Kopper, cooperated by cutting plea deals to testify against [[ken_lay_and_jeff_skilling | Lay]] and [[ken_lay_and_jeff_skilling | Skilling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:36">[02:35:36]</a>. Enron executive Cliff Baxter sadly died by suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:44">[02:34:44]</a>.

Fastow initially fought charges but caved when his wife, Lea, was busted for tax evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:46">[02:35:46]</a>. Fastow served six years in prison, while Lea served one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Fastow has since publicly admitted fault and speaks about corporate responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:06">[02:36:06]</a>.

News of Lay's close ties to the Bush family emerged, leading President George W. Bush to publicly downplay their relationship, despite traveling on Enron's corporate jet for his inauguration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:09">[02:37:09]</a>.

Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, was devastated by the scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:29">[02:37:29]</a>. Although not found guilty of direct involvement in the fraud, they faced criminal action for destroying documents, leading the SEC to revoke their CPA license in mid-2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:48">[02:16:48]</a>. This, combined with their auditing of WorldCom, led to the demise of the firm, which had employed 85,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a>.

### Sarbanes-Oxley Act
On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed the [[sarbanesoxley_and_its_impact | Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] into law, pushed quickly and almost unanimously through Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:51">[02:37:51]</a>. This act was a "kitchen sink" response to Enron and other scandals, designed to "put a lid on the cookie jar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:42">[02:38:42]</a>. Key provisions include:
*   Requiring CEOs and CFOs to personally certify the accuracy of financial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:53">[02:38:53]</a>.
*   Imposing more severe penalties for fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:04">[02:39:04]</a>.
*   Restricting tampering with or destroying evidence, making it a felony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:07">[02:39:07]</a>.
*   Requiring outside auditors to be more independent, forcing tax firms to spin off their consulting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>.
*   Increasing required disclosures for public companies, including all off-balance sheet entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:23">[02:39:23]</a>.

[[sarbanesoxley_and_its_impact | Sarbanes-Oxley's impact]] was significant, making IPOs and public company operation more complex, potentially contributing to companies staying private longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:27">[02:39:27]</a>. It's argued that this shift may have moved fraud from public to private markets, as seen with Theranos and FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. A provision of Sarbanes-Oxley regarding impeding official proceedings was even used to prosecute January 6th Capitol rioters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:03">[02:40:03]</a>.

### Trials and Sentences
In May 2006, a jury convicted [[ken_lay_and_jeff_skilling | Skilling]] on 19 of 28 counts of wire fraud and securities fraud, and [[ken_lay_and_jeff_skilling | Lay]] on six counts of securities fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:39">[02:42:39]</a>. On July 5, 2006, before sentencing, Lay died of a heart attack at his Colorado vacation home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:52">[02:42:52]</a>. His death resulted in the verdict against him being vacated, meaning any money he had was not seized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:34">[02:43:34]</a>. Lay's funeral was attended by George H.W. Bush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a>, and his obituary portrayed him as a benevolent man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:40">[02:44:40]</a>.

On October 23, 2006, Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:01">[02:46:01]</a>. After appeals that reached the U.S. Supreme Court, his sentence was reduced to 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:26">[02:46:26]</a>. Skilling served 12 years and was released in February 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:31">[02:46:31]</a>. In 2020, he founded a new energy trading company in Texas called Veld LLC, rumored to be working with Lou Pai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:49">[02:46:49]</a>.

### Bankruptcy Proceedings and Unexpected Payouts
In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the debtor (company) remains in control under court supervision to reorganize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:45">[02:30:45]</a>. John Ray, who is now managing FTX's bankruptcy, was brought in as Enron's chief administrative officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:18">[02:31:18]</a>. Ray secured $13 billion for creditors (about 36 cents on the dollar), significantly more than the initial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:10">[02:32:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Enron stock price, which had plummeted to 61 cents a share on December 2, 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:14">[02:28:14]</a>, saw an unexpected return. In September 2008, the post-bankruptcy shell of Enron finalized settlements from lawsuits against banks that participated in the company's shenanigans, totaling $7.2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:24">[02:50:24]</a>. This resulted in a distribution of $6.79 per common share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:41">[02:50:41]</a>. Anyone who bought Enron stock for 61 cents between the Dynegy merger collapse and the bankruptcy would have seen over a 10x return if they held for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:48">[02:50:48]</a>.

### Other Post-Enron Successes
*   **John Arnold:** A successful Enron trader, who was never accused of wrongdoing, received an $8 million bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:01">[02:55:01]</a>. He later used this as seed money to start Centaurus, one of the highest-performing hedge funds ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:24">[02:54:24]</a>.
*   **Richard Kinder:** Enron's former Vice Chairman, Kinder was a "pipeline guy" who prioritized the ethical and real value creation of the pipeline business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:33">[02:55:33]</a>. When Enron's focus shifted away from this, he left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:24">[02:56:24]</a>. He received a sweetheart deal for a set of pipeline assets, which became the foundation for Kinder Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:03">[02:56:03]</a>. Today, Kinder Morgan is a $40 billion company, and Kinder is a billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:12">[02:56:12]</a>.
*   **Berkshire Hathaway:** After the Dynegy deal fell apart, Dynegy seized Enron's core pipeline assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:26">[02:48:26]</a>. Dynegy later sold these valuable assets, and [[legacy_and_breakup_of_standard_oil | Berkshire Hathaway Energy]] ended up buying them, bringing the original InterNorth assets "home to Omaha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:46">[02:48:46]</a>.
*   **GE:** Bought Enron's wind business, which became a cornerstone of their wind energy business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:54">[02:56:54]</a>.
*   **Chevron:** Reportedly bought Enron's building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">[02:57:07]</a>.

## Analysis: Company vs. Business
Enron's story clearly illustrates the difference between a corporation ("company") and a viable "business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:31">[02:57:31]</a>. Enron was a massive corporation with structure, people, and impressive reporting, but its underlying business lacked sustainable profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:15">[02:58:15]</a>.
*   **Power:** While the initial pipeline business had elements of monopoly (a [[legacy_and_breakup_of_standard_oil | cornered resource]]), these were geographically limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:06">[03:01:06]</a>. The energy derivatives market, while innovative, would likely have led to an oligopoly where Enron was merely one participant, not a dominant force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:50">[02:59:50]</a>. Enron Online could have provided market power through information advantage, but this depended on consistent, fair trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Playbook:** Enron's playbook involved using off-balance sheet partnerships to conceal billions in losses and debt, a practice largely made impossible by [[sarbanesoxley_and_its_impact | Sarbanes-Oxley]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:46">[03:04:46]</a>. The underlying fraud was exacerbated by linking all internal incentives and external collateralization to the company's stock price, creating [[financial_innovations_and_fraud | correlated risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:41">[03:05:41]</a>. Enron's fatal flaw was "borrowing from the future until there was no future left to borrow from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:52">[03:08:52]</a>. They recognized 20 years of potential upside as immediate revenue, then applied a large multiple to this already inflated revenue, essentially "double dcfing" and "triple multiplying" the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:43">[03:09:43]</a>. This created an unsustainable "path dependent spreadsheet" that lacked any resiliency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:22">[03:10:22]</a>.

> [!INFO] Charlie Munger's famous quote: "Show me the incentives and I will show you the outcome." This was abundantly clear at Enron, where incentives were dramatically misaligned, leading to fraudulent behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:37">[03:11:37]</a>. Everyone, from employees to ratings agencies and investment bankers, benefited from the stock price going up, thus incentivizing them to not ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

While Fastow was directly stealing money through the LJM partnerships, Lay and Skilling also greatly benefited from the fraud through board-approved compensation tied to the stock price, making hundreds of millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:22">[03:13:22]</a>.

### Value Creation and Capture
Enron managed to create very little value but captured far more value than it created, by orders of magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:18">[03:22:18]</a>. The legitimate value-creating activities included:
*   The pipeline business itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:30">[03:23:30]</a>.
*   The creation of a spot market for natural gas to provide real-time pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:36">[03:23:36]</a>.
*   The ability to use a derivatives market to hedge prices and stabilize cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:45">[03:23:45]</a>.

However, once the business became about derivatives trading as an end in itself, rather than a means for hedging or stabilization, "everything after that was bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:02">[03:24:02]</a>.

### Coda
The Enron story has been adapted into a Broadway play called "Enron the Musical," featuring literal raptors dancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:53">[03:24:53]</a>.

Nvidia, founded in 1993, has a history marked by continuous innovation and bold adaptation strategies, enabling it to transition from a highly competitive, low-margin graphics chip market to a dominant position in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>. The company's co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, famously "bet the company" three separate times, nearly going bankrupt each instance, but ultimately securing Nvidia's long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a>.

## Early Challenges and First Adaptation (1993-1997)

When Nvidia began, the computer graphics chip market was "brutally competitive and low margin," with 90 undifferentiated competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. The company's initial vision, conceived by co-founders Chris Malachowsky, Curtis Priem, and Jensen Huang over dinner at Denny's, was to create a graphics card to accelerate 3D graphics for consumer PCs, moving beyond expensive professional workstations like those made by Silicon Graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:18">[02:36:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>.

Despite being the "first dedicated graphics card company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:06">[02:54:06]</a>, Nvidia faced a critical misstep. An early deal with Sega to power their arcade and next-generation home consoles (which would become the Sega Saturn) led Nvidia to commit to designing chips using quadrilaterals as their polygon primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:01">[03:42:01]</a>. This proved problematic when Microsoft introduced DirectX, a standard API for 3D graphics on Windows, which standardized on triangles – the more fundamental building block for 3D shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:51">[03:48:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

By 1996, Nvidia was "up a creek," with its Sega deal crumbling and competitors aligning with Microsoft's standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:18">[04:02:18]</a>. Compounding the issue, the cost of memory had dropped significantly due to Moore's Law, making Nvidia's memory-tight chip designs (costing $200 in components) far less competitive than others costing $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

Facing just nine months of runway, Jensen Huang demonstrated "intellectual honesty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a> by deciding to scrap everything and align with Microsoft's DirectX architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:03">[04:21:03]</a>. This required laying off 70% of the company, reducing staff to about 35 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:21">[04:18:21]</a>. To ship a new chip within this tight timeline, they made a radical decision: they would use an unproven software emulator to design and debug their chip without physical prototypes, even though the emulator ran at one frame every 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:01">[04:47:01]</a>. This "lunacy" was born of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.

The resulting chip, the Riva 128, launched in 1997, became a massive success, selling 1 million units within four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:59">[05:49:59]</a>. It was "way more powerful than any customers are telling them they want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. This demanding timeline forced Nvidia to develop a unique process, allowing them to design and ship new hardware generations every six months, while the rest of the industry operated on 18-to-24-month cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:59">[05:59:59]</a>. This rapid iteration became a core competency, enabling them to double performance at a given price point every six months, far outpacing [[Nvidias business strategy and growth|Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:59">[05:59:59]</a>.

## Second Transformation: Pioneering the GPU (1999-2006)

With the success of the Riva 128, Nvidia gained traction, leading to a partnership with TSMC, a foundry that had previously ignored Jensen Huang's calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. This "landmark deal" solidified Nvidia's manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

In 1999, Nvidia rebranded its products, choosing "GeForce" for its gaming cards, a brand still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. The launch of the GeForce 256 marked a pivotal moment: Nvidia formally coined the term "GPU" (Graphics Processing Unit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>. This wasn't mere marketing bravado; it signified a fundamental shift. Prior graphics cards were "fixed-function Graphics accelerators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>, lacking the ability to handle dynamic elements like lighting and shading, which were hardcoded at the CPU level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

The next major innovation was the GeForce 3, launched in 2001, which introduced "programmable shaders and lighting on the GPU" for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. This was another "bet the company" move, requiring enormous capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>, but it allowed game developers unprecedented artistic control and "meaningfully different experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Nvidia developed its own programming language, CG (an extension of C), to allow direct GPU programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:11:00]</a>. This cemented the GPU as an intelligent, programmable processing unit, distinguishing it from commodity sound or networking cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

A crucial strategic partnership during this period was with Microsoft for the original Xbox, a deal worth $500 million a year, with a $200 million advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. While financially challenging due to low margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, it was "absolutely the right strategic decision" for Nvidia, leveraging Microsoft's support to further develop programmable shaders and combat Intel's "embrace, extend, extinguish" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. Intel's own attempts at dedicated graphics cards around this time "suck[ed]," reinforcing Nvidia's specialized approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.

This era saw Nvidia achieve meteoric revenue growth, becoming the "fastest semiconductor ever to reach a billion in revenue" by 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. By 2006, however, revenue growth had flattened, and gross margins were just 29%, compared to today's 66% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>. Competitors like ATI (later acquired by [[Nvidias relationship with Microsoft and the video game industry|AMD]]) had caught up on programmable shaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>.

## Diversification and Future Bets (2006 Onwards)

Around 2006, Nvidia began to explore opportunities beyond gaming. An anecdote, possibly a composite of experiences but "true in spirit," describes a quantum chemistry researcher using off-the-shelf GeForce cards and CG to complete computations in hours that previously took weeks on supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>. This illustrated the potential of [[Nvidias transition from gaming to enterprise and scientific computing|Nvidia's transition from gaming to enterprise and scientific computing]] and [[Nvidias role in the growth of artificial intelligence and deep learning|massively parallel computing]] for scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

Nvidia's strategic vision continued to evolve towards the power of simulation, recognizing that anything that could be simulated digitally — from aerospace parts to drug discovery — could be done faster and more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. This foresight, born from their own near-bankruptcy experience where they relied on chip emulation, positioned them for future markets like the [[Nvidias role in the growth of artificial intelligence and deep learning|growth of artificial intelligence and deep learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.

A notable example of this foresight was Nvidia's early investment in Keyhole (later acquired by Google to become Google Earth), a company that created a graphical model of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Jensen Huang saw this as a "simulation" company, demonstrating the broader relevance of computer graphics beyond video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

Nvidia's ability to "Reinventing yourself," as Jensen Huang states, is crucial when "technology moves this fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. This continuous self-examination and re-betting of the business, initially driven by the need to survive fierce competition, became the bedrock of [[Nvidias business strategy and growth|Nvidia's business strategy and growth]] and its later dominance in [[Nvidias dominance in AI|AI]] and data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.

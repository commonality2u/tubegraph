The current challenging period, while difficult for many, presents opportunities for businesses to find market dislocations or emerging needs that were previously nonexistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A specific category of companies has seen direct benefits from the increase in [[remote_work_and_regional_economic_growth | remote work]] and the shift in consumer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Benefiting Sectors and Companies

Companies that facilitate [[remote_work_and_regional_economic_growth | work-from-home]] environments or provide essential services during times of reduced physical interaction are experiencing significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Video Conferencing Platforms**: Products like Zoom are clearly benefiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Asynchronous Communication Tools**: Companies such as Loom, which are in Sequoia's portfolio, are also seeing benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Delivery Services**: These are considered essential services, ensuring people receive food and basic necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Strategic Focus for All Companies

While not all companies directly benefit from these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, a key strategy for nearly every business during such periods is to focus on product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Sales and marketing efforts are likely to be challenged due to shifts in consumption behavior. Face-to-face selling, especially for an [[cloud_infrastructure_and_enterprise_enablement | enterprise]] company, may be hampered, and marketing channels could be saturated or deemed insensitive for certain products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Instead, companies are advised to:
*   **Invest in Product Development**: Hunker down and build a truly differentiated product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Prepare for the Rebound**: Surviving by focusing on product differentiation can provide a huge competitive advantage when market conditions improve, as the competitive landscape may be cleared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This concept is likened to Sequoia trees thriving after forest fires clear the brush, allowing more sunlight and space for those that survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### The Importance of Community

In addition to product focus, leaning into community is crucial for companies during challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Bringing founders together, whether for shared learning or emotional support, can provide invaluable advice, tips, and a sense of shared experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

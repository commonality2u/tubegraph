Investment memos have long served as critical communication tools within the investment community, offering insights, strategies, and reflections from experienced investors. This article explores the development and significance of investment memos, with a spotlight on the contributions of Howard Marks, co-founder of [[history_and_evolution_of_benchmark_capital | Oaktree Capital Management]], who is renowned for his influential memos in the financial sector.

## Origins and Purpose of Investment Memos

Investment memos originated as a means for investment professionals to document and share their market analysis, investment strategies, and views on economic trends. These documents serve several purposes: educating clients and partners, guiding internal investment decisions, and establishing a thought leadership presence in the investment community. Howard Marks, known for his incisive analyses, has significantly elevated the status and reach of investment memos.

## Howard Marks: A Luminary in Investment Communication

Howard Marks began writing investment memos in 1990, during a time when he observed the discrepancy between high-profile investment results and the behaviors of investors. His memos are known for providing deep insights into the investment process and for advocating a disciplined approach to investing.

### The First Investment Memo

Marks was inspired to write his first memo after discussions with a client about consistent investment performance versus the volatility seen in other investment strategies. Highlighting the merits of consistency over attempted market timing, he crafted a narrative that would resonate with many in the industry (01:26:36).

### Broadening the Audience

Initially sent to a limited number of clients, Marks's memos gained broader recognition in the early 2000s, particularly after his prescient commentary on the tech bubble—a memo titled "bubble.com"—proved correct shortly after publication (01:29:19). This pivotal moment expanded the audience for Marks's writings, transforming them into must-read documents within the financial community.

## Key Themes in Marks’s Memos

Marks’s memos address various themes, including market cycles, risk management, and the psychology of investing. A notable theme is "second-level thinking," which emphasizes the importance of thinking beyond conventional metrics and insights (01:01:50). This approach encourages investors to make decisions that are informed by deeper, qualitative understandings of market dynamics.

### Selling and Market Timing

An important topic often explored in Marks's memos is the concept of selling. Marks and his son Andrew debated the nuances of selling in their co-authored memo, "Something of Value." They discuss the pitfalls of selling based on price actions alone, advocating instead for a nuanced understanding of intrinsic value and [[investment_strategies_and_market_insights | opportunity cost]] (01:18:08).

From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The podcast *Acquired* has deliberately shifted its content strategy away from covering current events, recognizing the [[the_challenges_and_opportunities_in_content_creation_and_distribution | challenges and opportunities in content creation and distribution]] associated with timely topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.

## Reasons for Shifting Away from Current Events

The decision to move away from the immediate news cycle is based on several factors:

*   **Commodity Content and Shelf Life** Covering current news trends leads to commodity content, which can easily be drowned out in the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. Such content typically has a very short shelf life, estimated at around eight hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>.
*   **Risk of Inaccuracy** The more current an event, the less "evergreen" value it holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a> and the higher the risk of misinterpreting or "blowing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>. It is structurally impossible for the show to conduct the necessary investigative journalism or private investment diligence required to get a real-time story accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. The story is often deeper than it initially appears, making it challenging to get it right in real-time, even for top-tier investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>.
*   **Past Learnings** An interview with Sam Bankman-Fried is cited as a regretted experience, as the hosts were not investigative journalists and could not verify the information in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28">[01:15:28]</a>. This reinforced the idea that they need to choose the "games they play" and avoid the "current mania's game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. Even historical episodes done closer to real-time, like the Uber IPO episode, were not the full story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.

## Focus on Historical Retrospectives

*Acquired* is best suited for "huge retrospectives" where the story is already known and established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>. Their aim is to synthesize information and apply it to the contemporary world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. The podcast considers itself more in the realm of "historians" than "journalists," focusing on getting the story right over a long period with multiple perspectives, rather than covering breaking news like the OpenAI boardroom drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.

This approach ensures that episodes, even guest interviews, remain "evergreen" and continue to be sought out by listeners over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>. Examples of successful long-form, evergreen content include interviews with figures like Charlie Munger and Jensen Huang, which maintained strong engagement months after release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>. The focus on deeply researched, long-form content is the "core thing" that drives the show's flywheel and allows for unique, high-quality output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:49">[01:41:49]</a>.

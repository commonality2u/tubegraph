Microsoft, today the world's most valuable company, with a valuation exceeding $3 trillion and 49 years of history, was founded on the revolutionary idea of selling software [01:17:21]. While currently a sprawling enterprise encompassing hardware, gaming systems, cloud computing, and various applications, its origins were humble, focused on desktop software [01:48:48]. This period, termed the "PC era," saw a group of young "ragtag geniuses" push the boundaries of what was possible with personal computers [02:32:01].

## Early Beginnings and the Vision
[[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Bill Gates]] (born William Henry Gates III, known as Trey) was born in Seattle, Washington, in 1955 [03:38:00]. His father, Bill Gates Senior, was a prominent attorney and co-founding partner of Preston Gates and Ellis (now [[history_and_strategy_of_technology_companies | K&L Gates]]), while his mother, Mary Gates, was a powerful business figure in the Pacific Northwest, serving on numerous corporate and non-profit boards [00:40:00]. Growing up, Bill Gates was exposed to business conversations frequently, often dining with CEOs, senators, and governors [07:44:00]. This environment fostered a deep sense of ambition, with a 13-year-old Bill musing about which company or industry he would lead [08:10:00]. He was also intensely competitive, disliking losing at anything [08:35:00].

At Lakeside School, a rigorous college preparatory school, Bill Gates' journey into computing began in 1968 [09:51:00]. The school acquired a teletype connected to a DEC PDP-10 mainframe owned by General Electric in downtown Seattle, providing students with access to shared computer time [10:22:00]. This was an extraordinary opportunity, as personal computers were non-existent, and computing was largely confined to massive, room-sized machines or human "computers" [11:17:00]. Here, Bill, alongside his friend [[Paul Allen]], formed "The Lakeside Programmers Group," recognizing the nascent opportunity in programming [20:24:00]. They learned programming languages like Fortran, Lisp, and machine language, moving beyond Basic, which they initially used [22:38:00].

Their early ventures included finding bugs for a time-sharing company called Computer Center Corporation (C-cubed) and later writing a payroll billing program for a Portland-based time-share company [22:27:00]. Bill Gates, with the help of his father, negotiated a royalty agreement for the payroll software, earning over $10,000 [25:50:00]. This early experience in selling software laid the groundwork for future [[platform_business_models_and_strategies | business strategies]].

## The Birth of Microsoft and the Challenge of Piracy
The pivotal moment came with the announcement of the Intel 8080 processor in 1974, a 16-bit microprocessor. Bill Gates recognized this as "the heart of a real computer" at an affordable price, signaling the end of large, unwieldy machines [35:30:00]. He and Paul Allen, inspired by [[Gordon Moore]]'s observation on semiconductor improvements (Moore's Law), envisioned a future where computing would become "free" due to exponential cost reduction [30:44:00]. This led to the iconic vision of "a computer on every desk in every home" [32:00:00].

In December 1974, Paul Allen discovered the Altair 8800 on the cover of *Popular Electronics* [37:36:00]. The Altair, priced at $397, was the world's first mass-market commercially available microcomputer, though it lacked a screen or keyboard, relying on switches and lights [43:31:00]. Recognizing the urgency, Bill and Paul called Mits, the Altair's manufacturer, falsely claiming to have a Basic interpreter ready for the 8080 chip [41:47:00]. Given Mits' desperation for software, they were invited to demonstrate it in Albuquerque, New Mexico [42:31:00]. Paul Allen famously wrote the bootloader on the plane during his flight to Albuquerque [45:31:00].

Microsoft was founded as a two-person partnership between Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, in Albuquerque [52:21:00]. The name, coined by Paul Allen, combined "microcomputer" and "software," signaling their core [[business_strategies_and_history | business strategy]]: to focus exclusively on software [52:51:00]. They initially held a 60/40 ownership split, favoring Gates, later adjusting to 64/36 [53:58:00].

Microsoft signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Mits for their Basic interpreter, receiving $30 per copy sold and 50% of sub-licensing revenue (though sub-licensing was unlikely given Mits' competitive stance) [55:24:00]. The deal was capped at $180,000 [56:06:00]. A crucial clause, likely inserted by Gates' lawyer father, stated that Mits *must* use its "best efforts to license, promote, and commercialize the Basic broadly" [56:56:00].

Despite the Altair selling thousands of units monthly, Microsoft's revenue remained low ($16,000 in 1975, $22,000 in 1976) [57:28:00]. This was due to rampant software piracy, as the legal framework for protecting software was not yet established [58:34:00]. Bill Gates campaigned against piracy, writing "An Open Letter to Hobbyists" [59:14:00]. It wasn't until 1980 that Congress amended copyright law to include "computer programs" as copyrightable creative works [01:00:36:00]. This legalized the software licensing model, allowing creators to retain ownership while granting conditional usage rights [01:02:37:00].

## The IBM PC Partnership and Market Dominance
In 1977, the "1977 Trinity" of personal computers—the RadioShack TRS-80, the Commodore PET, and the Apple II—ignited the market, offering fully assembled, functional machines [01:04:35:00]. Mits, hesitant to sub-license Microsoft Basic to potential competitors, dragged its feet on deals with larger companies like NCR and GE [01:06:00]. In May 1977, Mits was acquired by Pertec, which inherited the dispute with Microsoft [01:06:46:00]. Microsoft won the arbitration in late 1977, gaining full rights to license Basic to anyone [01:08:58:00].

Microsoft immediately licensed Basic to the "Trinity" companies (Apple, Commodore, Tandy) and others [01:13:14:00]. These deals were often fixed-cost, upfront payments rather than royalties, demonstrating Gates' strategic focus on establishing Basic as the industry standard, making it a "no-brainer" for manufacturers [01:10:49:00]. This "positive spiral" strategy aimed to achieve widespread adoption, leading to competitors withering away as developers targeted the Microsoft Basic platform [01:11:10:00].

Microsoft's revenue surged to $381,000 in 1977, then $1.3 million in 1978, and $2.4 million in 1979 [01:14:03:00]. In 1978, they made a prescient move by going global, with half their revenue coming from Japan by 1979 through a partnership with Kay Nishi [01:16:38:00]. In 1979, with 25 employees, Microsoft relocated to Seattle, seeking a better talent pool than Albuquerque [01:18:15:00]. Gates chose Seattle over Silicon Valley to maintain secrecy and discourage job hopping, leveraging the University of Washington's strong computer science program [01:19:14:00].

The year 1980 marked a turning point with [[Microsofts partnership with IBM and development of MSDOS | the single most important deal in technology history]]: the [[Microsofts partnership with IBM and development of MSDOS | Microsoft-IBM PC partnership]] [01:21:29:00]. IBM, then the world's most valuable company with a market cap of $34 billion [01:30:51:00], recognized the exploding microcomputer market [01:30:05:00]. To avoid missing this wave, they initiated "Project Chess," a secret Skunk Works division in Boca Raton, Florida, tasked with developing the IBM PC within a year using off-the-shelf components [01:31:31:00].

IBM approached Microsoft for programming languages [01:37:05:00]. At this point, Microsoft didn't have an operating system, and Bill Gates initially referred IBM to Digital Research, led by Gary Kildall, who developed CP/M, a popular 8-bit OS [01:39:51:00]. However, negotiations with Kildall fell apart due to either his absence (reportedly flying an airplane) or a dispute over high royalty demands [01:40:40:00].

IBM then returned to Microsoft. Recognizing the opportunity, Microsoft acquired a 16-bit operating system called "Quick and Dirty Operating System" (QDOS) from Seattle Computer Products for $25,000, later paying an additional $50,000 for full rights [01:45:17:00]. This became MS-DOS [01:44:48:00].

The deal between Microsoft and IBM involved fixed payments totaling $430,000 for DOS and other language interpreters, with *no ongoing royalties* [01:48:50:00]. Crucially, Microsoft *retained the rights* to license DOS and its languages to *any other company* [01:50:04:00]. IBM likely agreed, believing its dominance would render Microsoft's independent licensing irrelevant, and to avoid antitrust concerns by not owning the software [01:51:50:00]. Gates, however, anticipated the rise of IBM PC clones and saw this as an opportunity to make DOS the standard for the entire PC ecosystem [01:52:42:00].

The IBM PC shipped in August 1981, selling over 500,000 units in two years [01:55:12:00]. IBM offered DOS at a low price ($60) compared to competitors like CP/M ($175), further cementing DOS's market position [01:56:23:00]. The [[Microsofts partnership with IBM and development of MSDOS | PC clone market]] exploded, led by companies like Compaq (which famously reverse-engineered IBM's proprietary BIOS) [01:57:51:00]. Microsoft licensed DOS to all these clone manufacturers on a per-machine-sold royalty basis, leading to exponential revenue growth. From $25 million in 1982, Microsoft hit $98 million by fiscal 1984, mostly from these high-margin software sales [02:02:30:00].

## Applications, Windows, and the Enterprise Push
As the PC market evolved, so did Microsoft's product strategy. Recognizing the potential for business applications, Microsoft launched its "consumer products division" in 1980 [02:14:47:00]. They hired Charles Simonyi from Xerox PARC, a legendary research center that pioneered the graphical user interface (GUI), desktop, mouse, object-oriented programming, and Ethernet [02:16:29:00]. Simonyi led the development of Microsoft Word and Multiplan (Microsoft's first spreadsheet) for DOS [02:19:26:00].

Multiplan initially struggled against Lotus 1-2-3, which became a dominant spreadsheet, even surpassing Microsoft's revenue in the late 1980s [02:20:21:00]. This taught Microsoft to always "target the next platform" [02:21:57:00]. This led to the development of Excel, first for the Apple Macintosh (released 1984), as it was the first widely available GUI platform [02:27:08:00]. Excel was the world's first graphical spreadsheet program, a key factor in its success [02:29:29:00]. Apple actively promoted Excel, matching Microsoft's marketing spend, recognizing its importance as a "killer app" for the Mac [02:30:03:00].

Microsoft was deeply involved in Mac development, with Bill Gates seeing the Mac project in 1981, and signing an agreement in 1982 to work on applications [02:31:41:00]. This agreement licensed Apple's "visual displays" to Microsoft for Windows 1.0 and "future versions," a decision that would later haunt Apple in a copyright lawsuit [02:39:01:00].

In 1983, Microsoft announced Windows, their own graphical operating environment built on top of DOS [02:36:20:00]. Windows 1.0, released in November 1985, was rudimentary, using a "tiled" interface rather than overlapping windows [02:37:50:00]. Despite its initial shortcomings, Microsoft was hedging its bets in a dynamic market [02:40:57:00].

The IBM-Microsoft relationship grew complex. IBM wanted to regain control of the PC ecosystem and proposed OS/2, a new, modern operating system developed in partnership with Microsoft, which would be proprietary to IBM hardware [02:42:03:00]. Microsoft, though committed publicly to OS/2 ("riding the bear"), secretly continued development of Windows, believing the market would not accept a re-centralization on IBM [02:44:00:00]. They also encouraged clone manufacturers like Compaq to adopt newer Intel 386 chips, which were more powerful and capable of running a true GUI, unlike IBM's preferred 286 chips [02:46:03:00].

When OS/2 launched in 1987, it was poorly received [02:47:25:00]. By late 1988, the "divorce" between IBM and Microsoft was evident, formalized by IBM taking full control of OS/2 development [03:07:01:00]. This freed Microsoft to pursue its own vision for the future of the PC.

In 1990, Windows 3.0 was released, marking a significant improvement with true multitasking and a better GUI [02:48:45:00]. It quickly gained traction, doubling Windows' market penetration in six months [02:49:17:00]. This success validated Microsoft's strategy, shifting Windows from "Plan B" to "Plan A" [02:51:52:00]. Microsoft became the first software company to surpass $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 1990, and by 1992, they hit $2.8 billion [02:54:16:00]. In January 1993, Microsoft surpassed IBM in market capitalization, inheriting the mantle of the world's leading technology company [02:55:43:00].

With this dominance, Microsoft focused on building a robust platform for developers, creating APIs and support [02:57:21:00]. They also pushed OEMs to pre-install Windows on PCs. From 1988 to 1994, Microsoft implemented a "per-processor licensing fee" where OEMs paid a fee for every microprocessor-based machine shipped, regardless of the OS installed. While Microsoft framed this as a simplification for customers, regulators later deemed it anticompetitive and forced them to stop the practice in 1994 [02:59:02:00].

Microsoft also turned its attention to the enterprise market, a realm previously dominated by IBM. Under Steve Ballmer's leadership, Microsoft built a direct and indirect salesforce, customer service, and consulting partnerships to cater to businesses [03:03:12:00]. Their secret weapon was the widespread adoption of [[Microsofts strategy during the Ballmer years | Microsoft Office]] by employees, which created a product-led growth motion from the bottom up [03:07:32:00].

Concurrently, Microsoft was developing Windows NT (New Technology), an operating system designed for the enterprise, inheriting work from OS/2 [03:09:41:00]. Dave Cutler, poached from DEC in 1988, led this effort, bringing credibility and expertise in building enterprise-grade operating systems [03:10:18:00]. NT would form the foundation for Windows Server and, ultimately, Azure [03:12:36:00].

### Windows 95
The culmination of this era was the launch of Windows 95 (code-named "Chicago") in August 1995 [03:16:20:00]. This was a massive, globally synchronized event, featuring Jay Leno co-hosting with Bill Gates, and "Start Me Up" by the Rolling Stones as its theme song [03:18:05:00]. People lined up around the world to buy the operating system, which sold millions of copies in weeks [03:20:38:00]. Coca-Cola even sought advice from Microsoft on their marketing [03:21:06:00].

Windows 95 represented a significant leap, offering a user-friendly experience with features like the "Start Menu," plug-and-play, and improved multimedia capabilities [03:21:56:00]. It was largely a new 32-bit operating system, no longer just an environment on top of DOS [03:28:07:00]. Windows 95 cemented Windows as Microsoft's "franchise product" [03:26:21:00]. In fiscal 1997, Microsoft reached $12 billion in revenue, the first software company to do so [03:27:07:00].

## Playbook and Power Analysis
Microsoft's success during the PC era can be analyzed through [[business_strategies_and_history | Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers]]:

1.  **Counter-Positioning:** Microsoft's willingness to embrace the microcomputer revolution and focus solely on software, without the baggage of hardware manufacturing or legacy business models like IBM's, allowed it to outmaneuver incumbents [03:56:11:00]. They made money by enabling others to succeed on their platform, a stark contrast to IBM's bundled approach [03:56:55:00].
2.  **Scale Economies:** The fixed costs of developing software, amortized over a rapidly expanding global user base, provided immense [[Platform business models and strategies | scale economies]] [03:57:46:00]. Once Microsoft had an installed base of millions, adding new features or products yielded disproportionately high returns [03:58:11:00]. Their early international expansion further enhanced this by amortizing development costs over a larger, global market [03:48:13:00].
3.  **Switching Costs:** Once users and businesses adopted Microsoft's operating systems and applications (like Office), the effort and cost of switching to an alternative became prohibitive [03:58:29:00]. Compatibility with existing applications and data formats (like Word documents) created significant lock-in [03:58:41:00].
4.  **Network Economies:** The increasing number of Windows users incentivized more developers to create applications for the platform, which in turn attracted more users, creating a powerful [[Platform business models and strategies | multi-sided network effect]] [03:58:50:00]. Document formats also created a strong network effect, both within and between organizations [03:59:31:00].
5.  **Process Power:** Microsoft fostered a culture where developers felt "personally responsible for the product," pushing innovation and rapidly iterating based on customer feedback [03:46:20:00]. They were world-class at learning from customers and integrating feedback, leading to significantly improved subsequent versions of their software [03:53:02:00].
6.  **Branding:** Though not as emphasized early on, the widespread adoption and perceived ubiquity of Microsoft's software, especially Windows 95, built a powerful brand that conveyed reliability and universality [03:20:00:00].
7.  **Cornered Resource:** While less about proprietary assets and more about talent and strategic positioning, Microsoft's ability to attract and retain top talent (e.g., Steve Ballmer, Charles Simonyi, Dave Cutler) was a critical cornered resource, especially given their obscure initial skills in a nascent industry [03:49:59:00].

Microsoft's journey from a small partnership to a global behemoth was fueled by a unique confluence of factors: the emergence of the personal computer, the "freak law of nature" that is Moore's Law, and the zero marginal cost of software production [03:34:50:00]. Their strategic decisions, including the pivotal IBM deal, the relentless focus on setting standards, and the willingness to hedge bets and pivot quickly, allowed them to capture unprecedented value [03:40:50:00]. They became the "talent magnet" of the PC era, fostering an ambitious culture [03:44:59:00]. Despite periods of internal struggle and external challenges, including [[Microsoft antitrust investigations and trials | antitrust scrutiny]], Microsoft's consistent innovation and strategic positioning cemented its place as the dominant force in computing.

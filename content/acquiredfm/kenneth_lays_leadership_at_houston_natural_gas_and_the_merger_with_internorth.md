[[early_life_and_education_of_kenneth_lay | Kenneth Lay]] was born in rural Missouri in 1942 and grew up in poverty, but his family prioritized education, leading them to move to Columbia, Missouri, so his older sister could attend the University of Missouri from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Ken followed in her footsteps, attending the same university where he developed a lifelong passion for economics, becoming a star student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. After graduating with a PhD in economics, Lay worked in the oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. In the mid-1970s, his former professor, nominated to the Federal Power Commission, recruited Lay to join him in Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Lay served as the Deputy Under Secretary of Energy in the Department of the Interior during a period of oil shocks and deregulation discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

He then returned to industry, joining Florida Gas, a pipeline company, as president and number two operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Lay was the second-highest executive at this natural gas pipeline company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## [[kenneth_lays_career_in_the_energy_industry | Lay]]'s Early Industry Influence
In 1982, Lay joined Transco Energy in Houston, Texas, often referred to as the "Silicon Valley" of the oil and gas sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Upon his arrival, two significant events were underway: ongoing deregulation and, unexpectedly, a fall in energy prices for the first time in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transco faced a problem with existing contracts to buy oil and gas assets at ever-increasing prices, which put them in a difficult position with falling market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Leveraging his economics background, Lay proposed [[the_innovation_of_creating_a_trading_market_for_natural_gas | creating a trading market for natural gas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Instead of the pipeline company buying gas from producers, Transco would operate the pipelines and facilitate a market where end consumers (like factories and utilities) could trade directly with producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This innovation created a spot market for energy and became a huge success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Lay became an industry legend, as the concept of trading or financialization of energy barely existed due to government regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This was not yet securitization of energy assets, but rather the first step in creating a spot market for real-time pricing between producers and consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Lay was uniquely suited for this role due to his industry experience, economics training, and government background, understanding that deregulation had progressed enough to make this possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Lay Becomes CEO of Houston Natural Gas
In June 1984, Lay, then number two at Transco, was poached by Houston Natural Gas (HNG) to become its CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. HNG was a significant publicly traded energy company in Houston, with a market capitalization of around $1 to $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This was a major promotion for Lay, elevating him to the top of a large company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## The InterNorth Merger
The following year, in 1985, Lay received a call from the CEO of InterNorth, one of HNG's larger competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. InterNorth, based in Omaha, Nebraska, was the largest pipeline company in America, known for being relatively conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. They were being pursued by the 1980s corporate raider Irwin Jacobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. To defend against Jacobs, InterNorth's CEO proposed merging with HNG as a "poison pill" to create a combined company too large for any raider to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

InterNorth acquired HNG for $2.3 billion, representing a 40% premium to HNG's stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Although InterNorth was the larger entity, it quickly became clear that Lay and the HNG executives would be running the combined company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Bethany McLean described this as InterNorth being "hoodwinked," realizing in retrospect that they had granted HNG significant board seats and influence, effectively giving away control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### The Headquarters Clash
A significant culture clash emerged over the location of the new company's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. The old InterNorth management and board members wanted to remain in Omaha, emphasizing the political importance of keeping jobs there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Lay, a consummate diplomat, had no interest in moving to Omaha, preferring to stay in Houston as a major player in the energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

To resolve this, the company hired McKinsey & Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The assignment landed on the desk of Jeffrey Skilling, a "hot shot superstar Junior partner" at McKinsey's Houston office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Skilling, a Harvard Business School Baker Scholar, was known for his sharp intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

Skilling presented his findings to the board in Omaha, asserting that the company, being the largest pipeline company globally, logically belonged in Houston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

At this time, natural gas was gaining favor as a "pseudo clean energy" source, contrasting with the negative perception of "dirty big oil and coal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Originally a useless byproduct of crude oil extraction, natural gas had seen scientific advancements that made it useful for heating homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Its appeal was boosted by its cleaner environmental profile, being the first part of the energy industry to be significantly deregulated, and its status as a domestic energy source, reducing dependence on foreign oil following the OPEC embargoes of the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Natural gas's properties, such as pipeline transportability and easy storage, also made it an ideal asset for a free-market enterprise as deregulation progressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

### Lay's Ascent and the Start of a Key Partnership
During a board meeting in Omaha in 1985 or 1986, just before Skilling was to present, the prior CEO of InterNorth was fired by the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. [[the_beginnings_of_enron_and_kenneth_lays_role_as_ceo | Lay]] had engineered a coup and was now the CEO of the combined company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The headquarters discussion was brief, with the board insisting on Omaha, and Lay, ever the politician, did not press the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The headquarters move to Houston eventually happened shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

This meeting marked the first encounter between Skilling and Lay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Lay, in his diplomatic style, apologized for the drama and praised Skilling's work on the study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. He expressed a desire to continue the relationship, appointing Skilling as their McKinsey partner to lead strategic initiatives for the newly combined company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. "And so it begins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

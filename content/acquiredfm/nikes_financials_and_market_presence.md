Nike, as a company, is the single largest apparel business in the world today outside of luxury brands, generating over $50 billion in revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:45">[01:32:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

## Early Financial Journey

The initial business, Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), started with a small investment. Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman each contributed $500 to finance the first shipment of shoes from Onitsuka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Early revenue figures for Blue Ribbon Sports were modest, reaching $8,000 in 1964 and doubling to $16,000 in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. The gross margin was not high, with shoes costing $3.50 a pair and selling for $6.95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.

### Financing Challenges
Early growth was constrained by financing options, as traditional banks in Portland, Oregon, were risk-averse and would only loan up to the company's book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. Phil Knight described this as "growth off your balance sheet is dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. This reliance on asset-backed financing meant that growth was a necessity for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>.

In 1970, Blue Ribbon Sports achieved over $500,000 in annual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. When Phil Knight requested a $1.2 million line of credit to finance inventory, it "tripped the alarms" at the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>. This financial constraint led Nike to seek alternative financing, eventually partnering with Japanese trading company Nisho Iwai, which offered to finance all of Blue Ribbon's inventory needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:57">[01:23:57]</a>. Nisho Iwai received a 4% royalty on every shoe sold by Blue Ribbon Sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:20">[01:24:20]</a>.

In 1972, Nike's first full year operating independently of Onitsuka, they achieved $3.2 million in revenue, a significant increase from $500,000 just a couple of years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>.

## Growth and Market Expansion
Nike's revenue continued to grow exponentially in the late 1970s:
*   1976: $14 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:30">[01:57:30]</a>
*   1977: $29 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:32">[01:57:32]</a>
*   1978: $71 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:35">[01:57:35]</a>
*   1979: $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:37">[01:57:37]</a>

By 1980, Nike held a 50% market share in running shoes in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:54">[02:09:54]</a>.

### Public Offering
Nike IPO'd in December 1980, in the same week as Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:48">[02:07:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:51">[02:07:51]</a>. Their market cap at IPO was approximately $400 million, while Apple's was $1.8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:11">[02:08:11]</a>. Phil Knight retained 46% ownership of the company after the IPO, making him one of the richest people in America with a net worth of $178 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:35">[02:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>. The IPO raised $22 million, providing the company with significant capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:29">[02:12:29]</a>.

## Post-IPO Challenges and the Jordan Effect
Despite the IPO, Nike faced challenges in the early 1980s as the "running boom" tapered off and the aerobics trend, led by competitors like Reebok, gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:27">[02:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:35">[02:10:35]</a>. By 1988, Reebok eclipsed Nike in sales, reaching over $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:54">[02:10:54]</a>.

The signing of Michael Jordan in 1984 proved to be a turning point. The initial deal guaranteed Jordan $2.5 million over five years, plus a 5% royalty on gross revenue from Air Jordan sales and incremental sales across the entire Nike basketball line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">[02:17:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:11">[02:18:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:09">[02:20:09]</a>. In its first year (1985), Air Jordan 1 sales and associated merchandise reached $126 million, far exceeding the goal of $3 million over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:04">[02:31:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:43">[02:31:43]</a>. Jordan earned $6.3 million from Nike in 1985, equivalent to his entire seven-year contract with the Chicago Bulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:28">[02:24:28]</a>.

The Jordan brand experienced a dip in years two and three due to overstuffing the channel and quality issues with the Air Jordan 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:26">[02:31:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:10">[02:32:10]</a>. However, a renegotiated deal in 1987 saw Jordan stay with Nike, with total guarantees increasing to at least $18 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:18">[02:43:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:22">[02:43:22]</a>. Sales of the Jordan brand soared, reaching $200-$500 million in the late 1980s and early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:55">[02:43:55]</a>.

## Modern Financials and Market Presence
Nike today is a global powerhouse:
*   **Revenue:** $51 billion, growing 10% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:30">[03:20:30]</a>.
*   **Market Leadership:** The largest apparel company globally outside of luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:36">[03:20:36]</a>. Nike's sales to women alone are larger than all of Lululemon's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:43">[03:20:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:48">[03:20:48]</a>.
*   **Brand Breakdown:** The Nike brand itself accounts for $49 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:15">[03:21:15]</a>. Footwear is still their core business, nearly 3x larger than apparel revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:36">[03:24:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:38">[03:24:38]</a>.
*   **Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) Shift:** Approximately 40% of their business is now direct-to-consumer (D2C), sold through their stores or website, a significant shift from their historical wholesale model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:31">[03:21:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:42">[03:21:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:46">[03:21:46]</a>.
*   **Profitability:** Gross margin is 44% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:03">[03:22:03]</a>. Operating income is $6.4 billion, with an operating margin of 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:39">[03:22:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:43">[03:22:43]</a>.
*   **Capital:** Nike holds $8.5 billion in inventory and $10.7 billion in cash and equivalents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:53">[03:22:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:04">[03:23:04]</a>. They have had 30 consecutive quarters of increasing dividend payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:38">[03:23:38]</a>.
*   **Demand Creation:** Nike spends $4 billion annually on "demand creation," which includes their [[Nikes business and marketing strategy | sports marketing]] budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:04">[03:24:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:07">[03:24:07]</a>.

### Jordan Brand Dominance
The Jordan brand is the fastest-growing part of Nike, with growth rates around 35% annually over the last three years, reaching $6.6 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:04">[02:45:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:12">[02:45:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:14">[02:45:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:29">[02:45:29]</a>. Jordan earns over $300 million a year from this brand, 20 years after his final retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:35">[02:45:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:38">[02:45:38]</a>.

### Market Share and Competition
Nike holds a near monopoly in basketball shoes, with 86% share in performance basketball and 96% in lifestyle basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:05">[03:26:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:07">[03:26:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:15">[03:26:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:17">[03:26:17]</a>. They are also the official uniform supplier for the MLB, [[NFLs Influence and Business Strategy | NFL]], and NBA, with the NFL deal alone being around $200 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:31">[03:27:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:33">[03:27:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:37">[03:27:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:41">[03:27:41]</a>.

Compared to its main competitors, Nike is more than twice the size of Adidas, which in turn is more than three times the size of the third-largest player, Skechers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:17">[02:56:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:19">[02:56:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:23">[02:56:23]</a>.

### Strategic Financial Decisions
Nike intentionally does not fully capture the value of its products in the secondary market. Highly sought-after limited edition sneakers that sell for $150-$300 at retail can fetch thousands on secondary markets, but Nike chooses not to raise its initial prices to capture this value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:31">[02:59:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:35">[02:59:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:40">[02:59:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:45">[02:59:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>. This decision is believed to maintain accessibility and widespread brand appeal, ensuring the "dream" of Nike remains attainable for a global audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:56">[02:59:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>.

Nike's gross profit margins (44%) are slightly lower than Adidas (46%), which might suggest a deliberate strategy to prioritize market penetration and brand ubiquity over maximizing short-term profit margins on individual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:09">[03:16:09]</a>.

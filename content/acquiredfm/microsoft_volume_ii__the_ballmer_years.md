The period from 1995 to 2014, known as [[Bill Gates leadership and strategic decisions in Microsofts growth | Bill Gates']] and [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Steve Ballmer's]] leadership, was marked by significant growth for [[Microsoft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. During this era, [[Microsoft]]'s annual revenue expanded from $6 billion to $80 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Despite challenges with timing and execution on products like Zune and Bing, the company became phenomenally successful and mastered selling enterprise software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. While often framed as a "fall" due to cultural problems, failed consumer products, and [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | antitrust]] issues, the reality is more nuanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Internet and the Browser Wars (1995-2000)

When [[Development and impact of the Microsoft Windows operating system | Windows 95]] launched in August 1995, it notably lacked an internet browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This was a deliberate omission in the previous development phase of [[Development and impact of the Microsoft Windows operating system | Windows 95]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. At the time, "going online" for consumers meant using "walled garden" services like CompuServe (owned by H&R Block), Prodigy, or AOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

[[Microsoft]] initially sought to acquire AOL in 1993, but upon being rebuffed, they started their own internal "Project Marvel" to build an online service, which eventually became MSN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Simultaneously, many in tech believed the future was the "Information Super Highway" mediated by pay television providers like cable and satellite companies, focusing on interactive television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. [[Microsoft]] pursued partnerships with these companies in "CableSoft" initiatives, where [[Microsoft]] would provide software for set-top boxes and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Bill Gates' book "The Road Ahead," published in November 1995, initially evangelized this vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

However, the rapid growth of the internet began to shift [[Microsoft]]'s focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

*   **Internal Memos**:
    *   In January 1994, James Allard, a Windows networking engineer, wrote "Windows: The Next Killer Application for the Internet," identifying Mosaic as a rapidly spreading software and advocating for [[Microsoft]] to "Embrace and Extend" the internet into Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
    *   In February 1994, Steven Sinofsky, Bill Gates' technical assistant, observed widespread internet use for non-academic purposes at Cornell University, leading him to write the "Cornell is Wired!" memo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Bill Gates stated this made him "take the internet quite seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **The Internet Tsunami**: Bill Gates convened an internet offsite in April 1994, where he declared that "exponential phenomena cannot be ignored" and that the internet was a core [[Microsoft]] company value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Later, in his "Internet Tidal Wave" memo (intended for publication), Gates emphasized the internet's crucial importance to every part of [[Microsoft]]'s business, deeming it "more important than the arrival of the graphical user interface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. The softcover version of "The Road Ahead" replaced nearly all mentions of the "Information Super Highway" with "the internet and the web browser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Netscape's Rise**: Mark Andreessen, the developer of Mosaic, co-founded Electric Media (soon to be Netscape) with Jim Clark in April 1994, initially aiming to build set-top boxes for the Information Super Highway, despite Andreessen's deep understanding of the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. By October 1994, Netscape launched Mosaic Navigator, a new web browser, for free download, planning to monetize by selling server software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.
*   **IE's Development**: [[Microsoft]] initially sought to license a browser, meeting with Booklink in May 1994, but AOL acquired Booklink for $30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. [[Microsoft]] then licensed the source code for the original Mosaic browser from Spyglass for $2 million, which became the base for [[Microsoft]] Internet Explorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. Although Internet Explorer's "about" menu cited NCSA Mosaic via Spyglass, [[Microsoft]] engineers significantly modified the code, focusing on deep integration with Windows rather than a standalone application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>.
*   **The Turning Point**: On August 9, 1995, just before [[Development and impact of the Microsoft Windows operating system | Windows 95]]'s launch, Netscape went public with a $3 billion market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>. Mark Andreessen famously declared that Netscape would "reduce Windows to a poorly debugged set of device drivers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Bill Gates acknowledged Netscape as a competitor born on the internet, threatening to "commoditize the underlying operating system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>. To counter this, [[Microsoft]] began bundling Internet Explorer for free with every copy of [[Development and impact of the Microsoft Windows operating system | Windows 95]] starting December 7, 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. This move caused Netscape's stock to drop by a third and never recover, ultimately leading to AOL's acquisition of Netscape for over $4 billion in November 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>. By 2000, Internet Explorer achieved nearly 100% worldwide browser market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. In August 1997, [[Microsoft]]'s partnership with Apple included making Internet Explorer the default browser on Mac, displacing Netscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

## [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | Antitrust Saga]] (1990-2011)

The [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | antitrust]] scrutiny against [[Microsoft]] began with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1990, investigating "per processor licensing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. In July 1993, the FTC deadlocked 2-2, seemingly closing the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>. However, in August 1993, the Department of Justice (DOJ) unprecedentedly picked up the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>.

*   **1994 Consent Decree**: In July 1994, [[Microsoft]] settled with the DOJ, agreeing to a consent decree that prohibited tying the sale of [[Microsoft]] application products to Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>. Crucially, the decree allowed [[Microsoft]] to integrate "additional features" into the Windows operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.
*   **Internet Explorer Dispute**: In October 1997, the DOJ argued that bundling Internet Explorer violated the 1994 consent decree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered [[Microsoft]] to ship a version of Windows without IE to OEMs, which led to a non-functional product and further animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. The appellate court later ruled in May 1998 that [[Microsoft]] could continue bundling IE and other features as long as it benefited consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.
*   **1998 Lawsuit and Trial**: One week later, on May 18, 1998, the DOJ launched a new, wide-ranging [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | antitrust]] lawsuit, alleging [[Microsoft]] violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by abusing its monopoly power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.
    *   **Bill Gates' Deposition**: In August 1998, Bill Gates was deposed for 20 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. His combative and evasive demeanor, captured on video despite initial assumptions it would only be transcripted, was strategically used by the prosecution to sway public and judicial opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>.
    *   **Findings and Remedies**: In November 1999, Judge Jackson issued a "finding of fact" that [[Microsoft]] was indeed a monopoly in the operating systems business due to network effects and high switching costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>. On June 7, 2000, he ruled that [[Microsoft]] had abused its monopoly power and ordered the company to be broken up into two separate entities: an operating system company and an applications company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>. This ruling coincided with a 55% drop in [[Microsoft]]'s market cap, from $600 billion to $270 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.
*   **Resolution**: In June 2000, it was discovered that Judge Jackson had secretly met with reporters, leading to his removal from the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>. An appeals court installed a new judge, who encouraged settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>. In November 2001, [[Microsoft]] and the DOJ finally settled, reversing the breakup order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>. The settlement, approved in 2002, upheld [[Microsoft]]'s monopoly status but imposed a five-year consent decree, requiring non-exclusionary contracts with PC makers, interoperability with non-[[Microsoft]] software, and an independent technical committee for complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.

## Impact of [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | Antitrust]] and [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Steve Ballmer's]] Ascent

The [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | antitrust]] saga, spanning 21 years (1990-2011), had immense cultural and emotional costs for [[Microsoft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>. Employees experienced a shift from being seen as the "best and brightest" to being perceived as "evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>. It also slowed down development due to increased protocol documentation and led to billions in private lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>.

*   **Bill Gates' Transition**: The personal toll on Bill Gates was significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. In July 1998, [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] was promoted to President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:25">[01:26:25]</a>. On January 13, 2000, Bill Gates transitioned from CEO to Chief Software Architect, with [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] becoming CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>.
*   **[[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Ballmer's]] Leadership**: During this turbulent period, [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] served as the "emotional rock" for the company, maintaining morale and preventing a mass exodus of talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>. His immediate priorities as CEO were to hold the company together emotionally, resolve the [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | antitrust]] issues, and ensure continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a>.
    *   **Making Peace**: One of [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Ballmer's]] first moves was promoting Brad Smith to General Counsel with the directive to "make peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. This effort successfully transformed [[Microsoft]]'s regulatory perception, making them a trusted partner to governments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>.

## [[Microsofts Enterprise Transformation | Enterprise Transformation]]

Under [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Steve Ballmer]], [[Microsoft]] began a profound [[Microsofts Enterprise Transformation | transformation]] from a broad technology company into "the" Enterprise technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:01">[01:33:01]</a>. This shift was fueled by [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Ballmer's]] passion for the enterprise and his recognition that the "enterprise is not about users, it's about IT and it's about systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>.

*   **Product Stack**: [[Microsoft]] developed a suite of multi-billion dollar revenue enterprise IT server products including SQL Server (1998), Active Directory, Exchange, Dynamics, and SharePoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>. These products seamlessly integrated with Windows and Office on client PCs, creating a powerful "client-server" ecosystem and a three-sided technology flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:28">[01:40:28]</a>. The strategy focused on providing a complete system solution rather than individual "best of breed" point solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>. Active Directory became a particularly sticky product, serving as the canonical source of truth for user and resource management within enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:09">[01:42:09]</a>.
*   **Business Model Innovation**: [[Microsoft]] pioneered the "Enterprise Agreement" (EA), a three-year annual annuity model where companies paid a per-employee (or per-device) fee for access to a broad suite of [[Microsoft]] products, including Windows and Office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:18">[01:47:18]</a>. This transformed a one-time software sale into a growing, compounding revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>. By 2007, multi-year EAs accounted for 40% of [[Microsoft]]'s revenue, with single-year EAs adding another 15%, making this new enterprise motion the majority of the company's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:11">[01:54:11]</a>. This shift emphasized stability, backward compatibility, and IT control over user desire for the latest features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:04">[01:53:04]</a>.

## Windows Releases and Consumer Product Challenges

*   **[[Development and impact of the Microsoft Windows operating system | Windows XP]] (2001)**: Despite the ongoing [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | antitrust]] challenges, [[Microsoft]] successfully developed and released [[Development and impact of the Microsoft Windows operating system | Windows XP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:06">[01:59:06]</a>. XP unified the consumer (9x) and enterprise (NT) codebases under the robust NT kernel while retaining the user-friendly interface of [[Development and impact of the Microsoft Windows operating system | Windows 95]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:17">[02:00:17]</a>. It ushered in an era of digital photography, music, and video, benefiting from the continued secular growth of PC penetration in U.S. homes, which reached 62% by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   **Xbox (2001)**: [[Microsoft]] entered the home console market with Xbox in November 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:26">[02:09:26]</a>. While important for [[Microsoft]]'s relevance with a new set of consumers, Xbox was a "lifetime breakeven business" and did not significantly contribute to [[Microsoft]]'s bottom line until later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:08">[02:10:08]</a>. However, it fostered a core competency in running large-scale online services, notably Xbox Live, which had 40 million subscribers by 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>.
*   **[[Microsofts Consumer Product Challenges | Windows Vista]] (2007)**: Intended as a successor to XP, [[Microsofts Consumer Product Challenges | Windows Vista]] (code-named Longhorn) was a "disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:02">[02:24:02]</a>. Its development was plagued by internal disarray, technical overreach (e.g., WinFS, Avalon graphics engine demanding high-end GPUs), and a lack of clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:55">[02:18:55]</a>. The product's launch, marked by the slogan "The Wow Starts Now," was incoherent and confusing, with features like User Access Control leading to user frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>. Consumers and businesses largely resisted upgrading, with 75% of corporate PCs still running XP in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:24">[02:25:24]</a>. The debacle consumed "years of their very best talent," crippling [[Microsoft]]'s consumer efforts and contributing to its perceived irrelevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:54">[02:33:54]</a>.

## Search and Mobile Struggles

*   **Search and Yahoo (2008)**: [[Microsoft]] was late to recognize the significance of search, initially treating it as a mere feature of MSN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:03">[02:40:03]</a>. The browser served as the "front door to search," which was becoming a highly monetizable advertising business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:16">[02:41:16]</a>. In 2008, [[Microsoft]] attempted a $47 billion acquisition of Yahoo to gain search market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:51">[02:44:51]</a>. The deal fell apart, but would have been "ludicrously profitable" due to Yahoo's stakes in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:03">[02:48:03]</a>. [[Microsoft]] eventually launched Bing in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:04">[02:45:04]</a>.
    *   **[[Satya Nadella leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Satya Nadella]]** led Bing during its early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:32">[02:49:32]</a>. The drive for search was existential for [[Microsoft]], as the economics of software were shifting from selling licenses to monetizing through advertising, a model where Google excelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Facebook Investment (2007)**: In October 2007, [[Microsoft]] invested $240 million for 1.6% of Facebook, valuing it at $15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:35">[02:58:35]</a>. They also gained exclusive rights to sell international banner ads on Facebook until 2011, leveraging the social wave to bootstrap their advertising marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:51">[02:58:51]</a>.
*   **Bill Gates' Retirement (2008)**: In June 2008, Bill Gates fully retired from [[Microsoft]] to focus on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:06">[03:00:06]</a>. This coincided with the launch of the iPhone SDK and App Store, which rapidly transformed the computing landscape.
*   **[[Microsofts Consumer Product Challenges | Mobile]] (Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, Zune, Kin)**:
    *   **Windows Mobile**: For decades, Bill Gates championed mobile computing, leading [[Microsoft]] to develop Windows Mobile, an OS for handset makers that integrated seamlessly with Windows PCs and Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:04">[03:05:04]</a>. However, it was treated as an "ingredient" by handset makers who could extensively modify the code, prioritizing cost over a unified user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:41">[03:06:41]</a>.
    *   **iPhone Impact**: The iPhone's announcement in January 2007 reset expectations for mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:01">[03:09:01]</a>. [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] famously dismissed it due to its $500 price point, failing to anticipate the business model innovation of carrier subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:40">[03:09:40]</a>.
    *   **Windows Phone**: [[Microsoft]] attempted to compete with Windows Phone, launched post-iPhone, by dictating strict hardware requirements and introducing a new "Metro" UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:19">[03:12:19]</a>. However, Google's Android, offered for free with monetization through search services, completely disrupted [[Microsoft]]'s traditional licensing model, leading to [[Microsoft]]'s loss in the mobile market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:02">[03:14:02]</a>.
*   **[[Microsofts Consumer Product Challenges | Windows 8]] and Surface (2012)**: Following the success of Windows 7 (a "Toyota Camry" release focused on stability and reliability led by Steven Sinofsky), [[Microsoft]] aimed to address new frontiers with [[Microsofts Consumer Product Challenges | Windows 8]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:50">[03:22:50]</a>.
    *   **Vision**: [[Microsofts Consumer Product Challenges | Windows 8]] pursued a "touch first" vision, validated by the iPad's 2010 release, and aimed to create a new developer platform using HTML5, running on ARM processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:10">[03:27:10]</a>.
    *   **Execution**: The product famously made the desktop an "app" and presented users with a tiled "Metro" start screen upon boot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:51">[03:32:51]</a>. This mixed metaphor, born from the decision to force a single Windows experience across all devices (desktops and tablets), confused users and angered OEMs not ready for touch-optimized hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:36">[03:30:36]</a>. [[Microsoft]]'s own Surface RT device, running on ARM, struggled to function as a full laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:35">[03:31:35]</a>.
    *   **Consequences**: [[Microsofts Consumer Product Challenges | Windows 8]] was a commercial failure, failing to galvanize a new developer ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:17">[03:33:17]</a>. By 2013-2014, Windows was no longer an exciting developer platform, with energy shifting to web and mobile apps outside the [[Microsoft]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:38">[03:33:38]</a>. The stock price languished for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>.

## The Emergence of Microsoft Azure

Despite consumer product challenges and a stagnant stock price, [[Microsoft]]'s Enterprise business continued to grow, setting the stage for the rise of [[The Emergence of Microsoft Azure | Azure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:18">[03:34:18]</a>.

*   **Vision for Services**: In 2004-2005, as Bill Gates planned his full retirement, [[Microsoft]] sought a successor Chief Software Architect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:36">[03:35:36]</a>. They chose Ray Ozzie (creator of Lotus Notes), who wrote the "Internet Services Disruption" memo in October 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:01">[03:38:01]</a>. Ozzie foresaw a future of services-based computing, where businesses would reduce infrastructure costs and deploy solutions "as a service" on a subscription basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:22">[03:38:22]</a>.
*   **Red Dog (Azure) Incubation**: With [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Ballmer's]] blessing, Ozzie began secretly recruiting for a project code-named "Red Dog" (later [[The Emergence of Microsoft Azure | Azure]]) in January 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:23">[03:39:23]</a>. This project was incubated outside existing divisions to avoid conflict with [[Microsoft]]'s on-premise Windows Server business, which saw cloud computing as a threat to their licensing model and partner ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:07">[03:40:07]</a>.
*   **Technical Leadership**: Ozzie brought in veteran engineers like Dave Cutler (architect of Windows NT) and Amitabh Srivastava to build [[The Emergence of Microsoft Azure | Azure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:01">[03:42:01]</a>. Cutler, notably, built a new hypervisor for [[The Emergence of Microsoft Azure | Azure]] from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:43">[03:42:43]</a>.
*   **[[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Ballmer's]] Commitment**: [[Steve Ballmer leadership and strategic decisions at Microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] eventually went "all in" on cloud, committing billions of dollars in capital expenditure to build data centers, despite internal resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:13">[03:43:13]</a>.

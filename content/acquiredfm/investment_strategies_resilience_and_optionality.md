NZS Capital, a public equities hedge fund, bases its [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investment philosophy]] on complexity theory, which suggests that the future cannot be accurately predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This approach stems from the understanding that complex adaptive systems, which govern the world, lead to emergent behavior, making exact predictions useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. Instead, NZS Capital emphasizes adaptability and developing guidelines and heuristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

The firm's [[investment_strategy_and_personal_strengths | investment strategy]] is built around two core concepts: **Resilience** and **Optionality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>.

## Complexity Theory and Prediction

NZS Capital's approach acknowledges that humans are "wrong a lot" as investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. Their philosophy originated from books like "The Origin of Wealth" by Eric Beinhacker and "Complexity" by M. Mitchell Waldrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. They view the world through the lens of complex adaptive systems, recognizing that emergent behavior makes precise future predictions impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional economic models that often rely on normal distributions and predictable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>, which NZS Capital views as being like "airbags that go off at stop signs but not when you get in a crash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:59:00">[32:59:00]</a>.

## Resilience

Resilience refers to identifying companies that can sustain durable, long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:22]</a>.

### Characteristics of Resilient Companies
Resilient companies tend to be further along their S-curve growth trajectory and exhibit characteristics such as:
*   **Mission criticality and high switching costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>.
*   **Scale**, particularly in industries governed by power laws where one company can capture a vast majority of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.
*   **Strong network effects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>.

Examples include Microsoft and TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

### Focus on Longevity over Productivity
NZS Capital's concept of resilience is inspired by the study of ant colonies, where approximately half the ants are not actively working. This seemingly unproductive behavior actually optimizes the colony for longevity and resilience rather than immediate productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. Similarly, companies focused on long-term thinking, like those often run by founders, are more resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>. The average CEO tenure in the S&P 500 being less than five years highlights a common short-term focus, unlike the ant colony's long-term optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

### "Non-Zero Sumness" and "Moats"
NZS Capital avoids companies whose competitive advantage ("moats") relies on extracting maximum economics from customers or partners, viewing such practices as non-resilient in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. Their philosophy is centered on "non-zero sumness," seeking win-win outcomes for all stakeholders: employees, customers, society, and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>. They believe that companies that create more value than they capture are more resilient over time, even if it means sacrificing some immediate profit or growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>. This aligns with Michael Porter's later concept of "shared value," which argues that caring for all constituencies is a long-term value-maximizing strategy for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>.

Texas Instruments (TI) is cited as an example of a resilient company that has focused on long-term compounding growth, pushing responsibility and decision-making down into the organization, and operating with a decentralized culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. TI's shift from leading-edge digital chips to a vast catalog of analog and microcontroller chips, which are "boring but beautiful," exemplifies this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:01:00">[56:01:00]</a>.

## Optionality

Optionality focuses on investments with asymmetric upside, even if the probability of success is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:00">[26:41:00]</a>. It's about making broad, safe predictions about future trends (e.g., electronics becoming more pervasive) while recognizing that specific winners within those trends are much harder to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>. This is akin to [[venture_capital_strategies_and_the_importance_of_optimism | venture capital]] [[investment strategies and stock picking in tech | investing]], where a few large winners can drive overall portfolio returns, rather than aiming for a high "batting average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">[39:43:00]</a>.

### Power Law Distributions
NZS Capital asserts that financial markets, like many natural phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, word frequency in books), follow power law distributions rather than normal distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>. This means that a few extreme outcomes ("outliers") account for most of the value created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>. A coin-flipping contest example illustrates this: if winning yields +50% and losing -40%, the average outcome across many participants might appear positive, but most individual participants will go bankrupt, while a few achieve massive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of positioning for "slugging percentage" (big wins) over "batting average" (frequent small wins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">[39:43:00]</a>.

## Root Moats (Resilience with Out-of-the-Money Optionality)

This "super concept" identifies resilient companies that are also layering on optionality, providing both a stable base and potential for outsized growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>.

*   **Amazon** in 1997 is a classic example; nobody could have foreseen the emergence of AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>.
*   **eBay** years ago, when its marketplace struggled but PayPal was an undervalued, "out-of-the-money option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>.

These companies embody the ideal operating philosophy: building resilience in the core business while investing in future options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Construction

NZS Capital constructs its portfolio as two distinct parts:
*   **Resilience**: Concentrated with about 15 names, representing just over half the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>. Turnover in this part is low (around 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.
*   **Optionality**: Distributed across about 40 names, making up just under half the portfolio, with a maximum position size of 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>. This part has higher turnover as positions evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:53:00">[45:53:00]</a>.

When an optionality position matures and demonstrates durable, resilient characteristics, NZS Capital will "average up" by adding more capital and moving it into the resilient bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:37:00">[49:37:00]</a>. They avoid letting optionality positions grow too large before a clear structural change, as a large position with a significant drawdown can severely impact performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:42:00">[50:42:00]</a>.

## Conviction vs. Overconfidence

NZS Capital views "conviction" in [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | investing]] as a synonym for "overconfidence," which introduces bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:54:00">[41:54:00]</a>. They believe that acknowledging uncertainty and maximizing the probability of getting lucky is a more effective strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>. The firm fosters a culture where team members call out each other's biases and embrace the possibility of being wrong, especially in optionality positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:59:00">[44:59:00]</a>. This allows them to "fail quickly" and move on from positions that don't pan out, preventing prolonged commitment to tough investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:05:00">[46:05:00]</a>.

## Semiconductors as a Case Study
NZS Capital holds about a third of its portfolio in semiconductors, across the entire value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:58:00">[56:58:00]</a>. They categorize their semiconductor holdings:
*   **Resilient:**
    *   **Texas Instruments (TI)**: A top position focused on analog and microcontroller chips, characterized by a broad catalog and long part lifetimes (30-40 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:55:00">[55:55:00]</a>. TI's operating margins are surprisingly higher than Microsoft's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>.
    *   **TSMC**: A resilient position due to its role as a neutral, pure-play foundry that does not compete with its customers, fostering deep trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. They are driving innovation in the semiconductor ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:09">[01:36:09]</a>.
    *   **Semiconductor capital equipment companies** like ASML, Lam Research, Applied Materials, and Tokyo Electron are also considered resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:18">[01:57:18]</a>.
    *   **EDA software platforms** like Cadence Design Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

*   **Optionality:**
    *   **Nvidia**: Held in the optionality tail due to its high valuation and the company's continuous innovation in digital chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.
    *   **Cree**: An early-stage investment in silicon carbide technology, an alternative to silicon used in electric vehicles and renewable energy, offering significant potential upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.

### Geopolitical Risk in Semiconductors
While acknowledging the geopolitical risks surrounding TSMC and Taiwan, NZS Capital views TSMC as one of the world's most important technology platforms, arguably more critical than Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. The global economy would face severe setbacks if TSMC's operations were disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:54">[01:20:54]</a>. They believe the U.S. and Western allies would likely protect TSMC, and any major conflict affecting it would impact the entire U.S. market, making the individual stock's performance a secondary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.

### Moore's Law and Ecosystem Importance
The "spirit of Moore's Law" continues to hold, with visibility for performance improvements over the next 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. This includes advancements in EUV systems, new transistor architectures like Gate-All-Around, and innovations in packaging (e.g., chiplets) and system-level performance (stitching processors together in clusters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. The semiconductor industry operates as a "super organism" or ecosystem, where no single company can do everything, fostering a healthy environment where multiple players capture high margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:19">[01:33:19]</a>. TSMC's "Open Innovation Platform" plays a crucial role in orchestrating collaboration across the industry, enabling collective advancement that a closed system like Intel's once practiced could not achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>.

### Vertical Integration vs. Pure Play
In semiconductors, pure-play, horizontal models are often more resilient than vertically integrated ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. Vertically integrated companies like Intel face battles on multiple fronts (e.g., process technology against TSMC, chip design against AMD), making it harder to excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>. Fabless companies like Nvidia benefit from high gross and operating margins with little cyclicality, as foundries like TSMC absorb that risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:40">[01:46:40]</a>.

### Leaving Money on the Table and Duration
TSMC's success is a prime example of a platform that has created significantly more value for its customers and ecosystem partners than it has captured for itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This strategy of "leaving money on the table" for customers generates goodwill, which in turn "buys the company duration" – extending the period of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:18">[01:50:18]</a>. This extended duration, even with moderate growth rates (e.g., 15% annually for decades), leads to non-linear and extremely high total value creation, as the majority of value accrues in the later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:53">[01:50:53]</a>. This preference for "slow, methodical, governed growth" over short-term "hyper growth" is a core tenet of their [[comparing_investment_approaches_in_global_markets | investment philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:33">[01:53:33]</a>.

## Organizational Culture and Research
The firm's culture encourages "unstructured research time" where analysts can "wander around not knowing what we're doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:24">[01:54:24]</a>. This allows for seemingly unproductive periods that can lead to rare, "watershed" insights that are crucial for long-term [[The Role of Luck in Investment Success | investment success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>. They prioritize understanding businesses deeply, which allows them to identify and underwrite value that others might miss, creating a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:12">[01:49:12]</a>.

NZS Capital makes its internal research and writing publicly available on their website, believing that sharing knowledge creates more value than it takes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>.

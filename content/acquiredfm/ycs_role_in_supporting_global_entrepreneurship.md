Y Combinator (YC), a well-known accelerator and now a significant growth investor, plays a crucial role in fostering entrepreneurship globally, extending its reach beyond its traditional Silicon Valley roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.

## Remote-First Approach and International Batches
Since the pandemic, YC's batches have been fully remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This shift to a remote-first model has significantly aided its global expansion, with 50% of its batches now comprising international companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. This means there is no longer a requirement for founders to relocate to Mountain View for the program or interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.

## Global Investment Footprint
YC's continuity fund, which makes late-stage investments (Series B and above), actively supports global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. Although YC's team is primarily based in San Francisco, they hold investments in various regions including India (where they back the top three breakout companies in the last two years), London, Latin America, and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.

## Mission and Impact
YC's mission is to "enable entrepreneurship globally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. The continuity fund directly supports this mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. YC believes in the presence of "incredible founders everywhere" and aims to provide them with the initial opportunities that might not be available elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. This support is critical, as many companies outside the U.S. may not have the same access to capital or networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>.

The organization envisions increasing its batch sizes to 1,000 or 2,000 companies in the future, if application volume and quality support it, demonstrating its commitment to scaling its global impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. This ambition reflects the belief that "companies can come from anywhere," with many B2B startups based outside the U.S. serving U.S. customers, exemplified by companies like Deel whose founder resides in Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>. YC recognizes it must continue to scale globally because talent is universally distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>.

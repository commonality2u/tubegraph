The collaboration between Acquired and [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] culminated in a live event at the Chase Center, showcasing a significant partnership.

## Origins of the Event
The idea for the "Acquired Live at Chase Center" show originated during a call with the [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan]] team, where discussions about a joint event were already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan]] initially suggested a smaller event at the Chase Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This sparked the idea for a larger, dedicated "Acquired Live" event, which the [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] team then developed into a full proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Rationale for the Partnership
The success of such a large-scale event was contingent on effective partnering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan]] was deemed an ideal partner because their team members are listeners who deeply understand what the Acquired show is about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This mutual understanding ensured that collaborative ideas "fit like a glove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Collaboration and Execution
The collaboration with [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] was described as "really special," enabling the event to reach a grand scale, from posters to stage art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Mike Taylor of [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] expressed excitement about the event, highlighting it as their "first official collaboration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Impact and Future Outlook
The partnership was highlighted as a "spectacular example" of achieving something together that neither party could have accomplished on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. It was explicitly stated that "no other partner in the entire world" could have made the event happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

The taste level in how the partnership was presented was praised, with [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] encouraging Acquired to "just go be Acquired" while being a part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The role of payments as a "centerpiece" in business building aligns with the [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

The future of the partnership is hinted at with mentions of "2025" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, despite the "never again" mindset after such a large event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. There was also a humorous moment when Jamie Dimon, the CEO of [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Chase]], was "welcomed" to the stage, causing murmurs in the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

Creative Artists Agency (CAA), founded in 1975, revolutionized the power structure in Hollywood by prioritizing a unique culture and team-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This approach was largely inspired by the founders' experiences at William Morris and aimed to change the industry's existing norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>.

## Founding Philosophy

CAA was born out of a "bad staff meeting" at William Morris, where a group of young agents, mostly in their 20s, disagreed with the agency's philosophical direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. They felt the agency should be signing top contemporary talent like Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, Sean Connery, and Sidney Poitier, rather than older stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. A "cardinal tactical error" by William Morris was the firing of Phil Weltman, head of their training department, which deeply impacted the young agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. This led five individuals, including Michael Ovitz, Bill Haber, Ron Meyer, Mike Rosenfeld, and Rowland Perkins, to decide to leave and establish their own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>.

One core disagreement with William Morris was its bifurcation of television and movie departments, despite the industries starting to converge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. CAA's founders believed that clients could work in both areas and that joint meetings between departments were necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.

## Team-Oriented Approach

CAA's distinctiveness stemmed from its team-based model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. Unlike traditional agencies where one agent "coveted one client," CAA assigned teams of people to each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. This ensured that even if a client went through several individual agents due to relationship issues, they would not leave the agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>. Over 25 years, CAA lost fewer than six clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>.

This team approach also enabled unique collaborations, such as assigning literary agents to actors, a practice that was considered unusual elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>. The philosophy was that if a literary agent's job was to read scripts for available roles, and an actor's job was to read scripts, it was logical for them to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>.

At CAA, the "meal ticket was how well the whole company did," fostering a collective success mindset where individual agents suffered if the group did not perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. This contrasted with competitors who preferred one-on-one representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

The agency encouraged even competing leading men like Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro to sign with CAA, promoting the idea that they were not truly competing if they were all under the same agency and could potentially work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. This strategy facilitated the packaging of talent for projects like *Heat* (De Niro and Pacino with Michael Mann) and *The Untouchables* (Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, and Andy Garcia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.

## Internal Operations and Innovation

CAA operated with a high-volume communication system. An average agent made 200 to 250 phone calls a day, with a commitment to returning all internal and external calls nightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>. Pre-internet, the agency used a "buck slip system," where agents would write notes on special paper for associates, which would be delivered in real-time, functioning as an internal email system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. The mailroom was a crucial part of this system and a fast track for careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>. The company even locked up its trash every night to prevent competitors from gaining insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.

The agency fostered an environment of constant learning and cultural awareness. Employees were encouraged to read widely, including a list of 100 magazine titles monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>. Michael Ovitz himself subscribed to 200 magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. This was to understand emerging cultural trends and anticipate what audiences wanted, as magazines were considered the "internet" of that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. This focus on cultural insight allowed CAA to branch into new areas, such as developing advertising campaigns for Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.

CAA pioneered the "packaging" of talent, where they controlled all elements of a film project—script, director, stars—before offering it to a studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. This gave them immense leverage, allowing them to dictate terms and "legally set prices" due to owning the "scarce commodity" of complete packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. They viewed studios primarily as "distribution entities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>. This strategy transformed the industry from a zero-sum game, where studios controlled everything, into a positive-sum game for the talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

## Client Relationships and Loyalty

The agency's loyalty to its clients was a core tenet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>. For example, Michael Ovitz dedicated significant time to Michael Crichton during his writer's block, continuously stimulating him with ideas and maintaining support, even though Crichton was not actively generating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. Ovitz described this as his "job to be there for him. Period. Not a discussable issue. Not a choice. Not an option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. CAA also proactively told everyone Crichton was working on an original project, even when he wasn't, to maintain his standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.

CAA believed in "overpaying" its executives when the company performed well, offering compensation that exceeded what could be earned elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. This fostered strong loyalty and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. The agency's success in consolidating talent and revenue allowed it to be a "cash-flowing business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

## Legacy and Transition

As Michael Ovitz looked to transition from CAA, he explored options for diversification, including taking the company public, selling to private equity, or acquiring an advertising agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:17">[01:48:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a>. However, he found it difficult to equitably divide the company among all its players and feared it would "disintegrate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>. Ultimately, he decided to make a clean break and pursue opportunities in other fields, such as investment banking and corporate deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>.

In the end, Ovitz sold CAA to the next generation for $200 million, a price that was paid over several years with an interest-free loan, prioritizing the agency's continued existence and preventing a mass exodus of talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:09">[01:52:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>. He considered the business an "enduring revenue stream" with franchises like *Jurassic Park* generating recurring income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:26">[01:52:26]</a>. This decision ensured that, unlike MCA, CAA continued to thrive as a strong agency after its founder's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:12">[01:50:12]</a>.

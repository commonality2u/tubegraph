Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, shared his perspective on the future of technology platforms and the strategic importance of open source during a live discussion at the Chase Center in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:21">[02:22:21]</a>.

## Meta's Vision for Human Connection and Platforms
Zuckerberg views Meta not merely as a social media company or an app company, but as a "social connection company" focused on "building the future of human connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>. This vision extends beyond current mobile apps to new computing platforms that enable ideal social experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

### The Role of Glasses and AI
Zuckerberg envisions a future where glasses become the primary interface, acting as a perfect AI assistant with context on user activities through cameras and microphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. These glasses would project holograms into the world, allowing for social experiences not constrained by small phone screens, fostering a realistic sense of presence and physical interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>. This represents the "ultimate Digital social experience" and the "ultimate incarnation of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.

Developing this requires overcoming significant [[technology_infrastructure_evolution | technological challenges]], including novel display stacks, miniaturization of components (chips, microphones, speakers, cameras, eye tracking, batteries), and new RF protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>. Meta has been working on this for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>.

### Strategic Importance of Owning Platforms
A core theme for Meta's next chapter is the ability to build ideal experiences without being constrained by platforms built by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>. This stems from past experiences where Meta, lacking control over the mobile platform, faced restrictions on its ad business and product features, which impacted profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Zuckerberg estimates Meta could be twice as profitable if it owned its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:29">[02:03:29]</a>. This commitment to owning core [[technology_infrastructure_evolution | technology platforms]] (AR glasses, mixed reality, AI) is an imperative for Meta's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>.

## Meta's Relationship with Open Source
Zuckerberg acknowledges that Meta, like almost all major technology companies, relies heavily on [[open_source_project_and_forprofit_business_model_integration | open source]] stacks and wouldn't have been built without them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:54">[01:40:54]</a>.

### Rationale for Open Sourcing
Meta's decision to open source some of its core technology was strategic. For instance, after Google kept its distributed computing infrastructure proprietary, Meta, seeing it as not a competitive advantage against Google, decided to open source its own equivalent, such as Open Compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:31">[01:41:31]</a>. This strategy aimed to make it an industry standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a>.

### Benefits of Open Source for Meta
By making its designs open, Meta fostered a [[community_driven_open_source_ecosystems | community of people building around it]], leading to a standardized supply chain, cheaper production (saving billions of dollars), and higher quality tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:55">[01:41:55]</a>. This philosophy also applies to its AI models like Llama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:47">[01:42:47]</a>.

Zuckerberg notes that these technologies, like AI models, are ecosystems that improve with broader adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:31">[01:43:31]</a>. Open source aligns with Meta's philosophy of avoiding dependence on other platforms, especially after experiences with mobile platforms dictating what could be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:46">[01:43:46]</a>. It empowers developers, allowing individuals to build without seeking permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:46">[02:18:46]</a>.

## Open vs. Closed Ecosystems in Future Computing
Zuckerberg believes there's an "ideological battle" and a "product competition" over the architecture of the next generation of platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:52">[02:16:52]</a>. He categorizes these as:
*   **Closed Integrated Model**: Exemplified by Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. While effective (like the iPhone's success), he views the perception of its superiority as "recency bias" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:43">[02:17:43]</a>.
*   **Open Ecosystem Model**: Exemplified by Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:06">[02:18:06]</a>. He points to Windows as a past leader in the PC era with its open ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:55">[02:17:55]</a>.

Zuckerberg's goal for the next 10-15 years is to build and ensure the success of the next generation of [[open_source_ai_versus_closed_source_ai | open platforms]] in computing, believing it will lead to a more vibrant tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:02">[02:18:02]</a>. He expects Apple to be Meta's primary competitor in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>. This competition is deeply values-driven, concerning how open platforms should be for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:32">[02:18:32]</a>.

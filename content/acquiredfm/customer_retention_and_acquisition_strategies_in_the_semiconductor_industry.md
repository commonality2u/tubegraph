In the [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]], particularly for companies like [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]], strategies often involve sacrificing current profits for potential future gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The objective is to secure future revenues through either customer retention, fostering customer loyalty, or by acquiring new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This approach prompts an examination of whether an increase in customers and revenue in the future will yield more differential returns, leading to a discussion of [[scale_economies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | scale economies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While [[scale_economies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | scale economies]] are present, they are considered to be of a quite unusual type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## [[scale_economies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Unusual Industry Characteristics]] and Their Impact

The [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] exhibits several distinct characteristics that influence its strategic decisions regarding customer acquisition and retention:

*   **Large, Lumpy Capital Investments**
    Building a new fabrication plant (fab) requires extremely large capital investments, often exceeding $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

*   **Predictable Technological Advancement ([[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | Moore's Law]])**
    Unlike many other sectors, the [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] benefits from "predictable material performance advances," commonly known as [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This predictability offers a relatively high assurance that making the correct [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | technology choices]] can lead to a 10x improvement in performance within approximately 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Such consistent and significant improvement is highly unusual in most industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

*   **Dependence on [[influence_of_upstream_suppliers_like_asml_on_semiconductor_technology | Upstream Suppliers]]**
    Technological advantages in the [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] are significantly driven by [[influence_of_upstream_suppliers_like_asml_on_semiconductor_technology | upstream suppliers]], such as [[influence_of_upstream_suppliers_like_asml_on_semiconductor_technology | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This reliance makes [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | technology choices]] particularly challenging; for instance, there were extensive past discussions among [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor companies]] about whether to pursue x-ray lithography, a decision that involved substantial financial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

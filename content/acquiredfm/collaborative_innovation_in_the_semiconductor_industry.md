The advancement of the [[the_evolution_of_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor industry]] relies heavily on deep and continuous collaboration between various specialized companies. This includes electronic design automation (EDA) software providers, chip designers, and foundries. The complexity of modern chip design, driven by the demands of [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | Moore's Law]] and emerging technologies like AI, necessitates an interconnected ecosystem where trust and shared ambition are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

## The Role of Electronic Design Automation (EDA)

Electronic Design Automation (EDA) is the field that creates the software tools chip designers use for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Synopsys is a leading company in this field, alongside Cadence Design Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This software is described as "productivity software for chip designers," akin to Microsoft Excel or Figma for the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The complexity of chip design is so deeply integrated into EDA software that it enables entirely new types of chips that would otherwise be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. EDA is considered essential infrastructure behind the AI era and all current [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Synopsys, founded 37 years ago by Art Deus, evolved to become an essential part of the [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor value chain]] and ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The company's origins highlight the early need for automated design:
*   In the mid-1980s, Art Deus's team at General Electric developed innovative design tools, including synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Synthesis allowed for the automatic design of circuits, yielding significantly smaller and faster results compared to manual design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   Early customers, like those at Sun Microsystems, provided critical feedback, acting as "parents of the tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This iterative process of feedback and improvement fostered a collaborative environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   The transition from "computer-aided design" (CAD) to "electronic design automation" (EDA) marked a shift where software actively "created something" rather than just aiding human designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

## The Necessity of Interdependence

Advancing [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | Moore's Law]] and achieving next-generation performance gains requires extraordinary collaboration across the [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. This includes:
*   Foundries like [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] innovating manufacturing processes to reduce transistor size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
*   Upstream suppliers like [[influence_of_upstream_suppliers_like_asml_on_semiconductor_technology | ASML]] developing better lithography equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.
*   EDA software continuously improving to handle increasing complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.
*   The ingenuity of chip designers to push boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

All these elements must work together in the same generation, betting on each other's dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

## Deepening Collaboration: From Enablement to Co-Development

In the past, the relationship between EDA companies and foundries was primarily one of "enablement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. EDA companies would take inputs from foundries and enable them in their products, acting as a bridge between foundries and chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. However, in the last five to six years, this has fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>:
*   EDA companies now embed engineers with foundries like [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]], Samsung, Intel, and GF during the process and technology development phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   This intense co-development is necessary because enablement alone is no longer sufficient; new inventions are required to push the boundaries of physics and handle the aspirations of chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.
*   This signifies a move beyond just "scale complexity" to "systemic complexity," where understanding how different pieces work together is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

## Systemic Complexity and Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO)

As the industry approaches physical limits, the ability to continue scaling depends on addressing "systemic complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. This means that problems like thermal management, warpage, and cracking due to high transistor density become critical design considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

A key aspect of this is Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This involves optimizing both the design (what is being built) and the technology (how it's manufactured) simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Synopsys is a leader in DTCO, making it possible to align design methodologies with available building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. This requires close collaboration, as EDA tools need to model what circuits can achieve based on foundry information, and foundries benefit from the optimizations provided by EDA tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

## Advanced Packaging and Multi-Die Architectures

To achieve greater performance, the industry is moving towards advanced packaging, where multiple dies (chiplets) are integrated into a single package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. This approach, exemplified by Nvidia's Blackwell chip using a silicon interposer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>, allows for "horizontal scaling" of compute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

The evolution of multi-die architectures is driven by dramatically improved "connectivity" between chips, including reduced distance, increased bandwidth, and lower energy consumption for data transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. This "connectivity-driven" architecture, combined with software-defined architectures, opens an "entire New Age" called "symore" – systemic complexity with a [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | Moore's Law]] exponential ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

## The Role of Simulation and the Ansys Acquisition

Physical testing of increasingly complex and interconnected devices is becoming too expensive, time-consuming, and impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. This makes simulation, including "digital twinning," an increasingly crucial aspect of design and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.

Synopsys's acquisition of Ansys, a leader in multi-physics simulation, aims to deepen collaboration and address these [[challenges_and_strategic_decisions_in_the_semiconductor_industry | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>:
*   **Deepening Core Business**: Ansys's expertise in simulating thermal and structural physics is critical for integrating complex devices onto chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.
*   **System-Level Design**: For system companies like automotive OEMs, Ansys provides the ability to simulate the entire digital twin of a product, integrating electronics, mechanical actions, and other physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.
*   This expands Synopsys's offerings to provide "design solutions from silicon to system," bringing together two companies to deliver a future engineering platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

The combined entities aim to accelerate simulation through accelerated compute and AI techniques, enabling more applications to be simulated effectively and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>.

## Customer Retention and Acquisition Strategies

The [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] has witnessed a significant shift in its [[customer_retention_and_acquisition_strategies_in_the_semiconductor_industry | customer base]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. Fifteen years ago, nearly 100% of Synopsys's revenue came from [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>. Today, 45% of its revenue comes from "system companies" – end-market OEMs that develop end products and do not necessarily sell chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. This shift highlights a growing need for these companies to design or architect their own silicon to gain competitive advantages in specialized computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

Many leading market cap companies now design their own chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. Even automotive OEMs that don't design their own chips engage with Synopsys to architect their electronics and virtualize entire electronic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. This "end-market pull" driven by AI and data processing, combined with the "technology push," accelerates innovation and reinforces the need for deep collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] operates on a principle of deep interdependence and continuous [[challenges_and_strategic_decisions_in_the_semiconductor_industry | innovation]]. From Synopsys's early days of integrating customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a> to the modern co-development efforts with foundries, the industry has shown a remarkable capacity for collective problem-solving. This collaboration, built on trust and a shared ambition to overcome technical and economic [[challenges_and_strategic_decisions_in_the_semiconductor_industry | challenges]], remains the driving force behind the continued "exponential" progress of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. The constant pursuit of the "impossible" and the ability to "work around science" through engineering are hallmarks of this collaborative spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.

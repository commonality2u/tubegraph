Geopolitical risk is a significant concern in the semiconductor sector, particularly regarding companies like [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. Public equities investors at NZS Capital, Brenton Johns and John Bathgate, extensively research semiconductors and discuss the implications of such risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## The Core Issue: Taiwan and TSMC

[[TSMCs geopolitical and technological risks | TSMC]] is a major holding for NZS Capital, but its location in Taiwan presents a unique and "company-ending risk" due to potential conflict with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. An analyst even directly questioned TSMC on an earnings call about Taiwan's sovereignty and the possibility of China invading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>.

### Global Economic Impact
TSMC is considered one of the top five most important technology platforms globally, arguably more critical than companies like Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. If China were to seize Taiwan and TSMC's fabs were shut down, the Western world could face a technological setback of at least five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a>, impacting global GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>. The current auto sector shortages are minor compared to what could happen if TSMC, which produces a quarter of the world's digital chips, ceased operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>.

This vital role means the U.S. and Western nations would likely act to protect [[TSMCs geopolitical and technological risks | TSMC]] at all costs, potentially even airlifting key personnel out of Taiwan, though this would still leave fabs unable to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:35">[01:21:35]</a>.

### Broader Ecosystem Vulnerability
The entire semiconductor ecosystem is interconnected, with companies like ASML, Lam Research, Applied Materials, and KLA being crucial suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>. If TSMC were compromised, the entire "super organism" of semiconductor manufacturing, arguably the most important super organism on the planet, would be severely affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>. Recreating this infrastructure elsewhere, even with access to all components, would take a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a>.

## Mitigation and Hedging Strategies
To mitigate this risk, some advocate for "semiconductor sovereignty" through initiatives like building new fabs in other regions, such as the 5-nanometer TSMC fab in Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>. Historically, fabs were also built in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>.

In terms of investment, if a major conflict between China and Taiwan were to occur, leading to a downturn in the entire U.S. market, typical hedges like defense stocks might be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>. Additionally, companies involved in manufacturing equipment, like ASML, could be defensive as they would be essential if new fabs needed to be built elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>.

NZS Capital generally avoids China tech companies due to concerns over ownership and the ADR/VIE structure, finding the situation "sketchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.

## Collaborative Innovation and Market Stability
The [[Collaborative innovation in the semiconductor industry | semiconductor industry]] is characterized by an open innovation platform, with [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]]'s Open Innovation Platform being central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:46">[01:36:46]</a>. This collaborative approach, involving equipment suppliers (like ASML and its laser supplier Trumpf, and lens maker Zeiss), EDA companies (like Cadence and Synopsis), and chip designers, is essential for driving Moore's Law forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:55">[01:38:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:44">[01:39:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. No single company can perform all tasks, emphasizing the "village" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:37">[01:41:37]</a>. This contrasts with Intel's historical closed system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>.

This ecosystem also demonstrates healthy economics, with many participants, including those producing commoditized chips like Texas Instruments, achieving high margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:19">[01:33:19]</a>. By leaving money on the table for customers and partners, companies like TSMC and NVIDIA build goodwill and extend their duration of growth, which is key to maximizing total value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:18">[01:50:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:09">[01:51:09]</a>.

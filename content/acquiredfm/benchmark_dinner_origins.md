The [[Importance and Dynamics of Venture Capital Partner Dinners | Benchmark dinner tradition]] began from an aspiration to inject new practices and ideas into the firm. When Peter joined [[history_and_evolution_of_benchmark | Benchmark]], there was a shared optimism with Bill Gurley about evolving the firm's approach [00:00:15].

## The Ben Franklin Inspiration
The idea for the dinners stemmed from Bill Gurley having read a [[ben_franklins_influence_on_modern_dinner_tradition | Ben Franklin]] biography [00:00:23]. Franklin reportedly held four dinners a week, each dedicated to deep dives into specific subjects such as finance, chemistry, and life sciences [00:00:29]. Bill Gurley took this as a catalyst, prompting the question, "why aren't we doing dinners?" [00:00:39].

## Early Experiments and Evolution
This led to a "playful experiment" with a few initial dinners [00:00:42]. A significant early dinner, held around 2006 or 2007 during Peter's first year at the firm, proved to be "amazing" with time seeming to "stand still" [00:00:46]. This particular dinner included not only the partners but also four outside guests: Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos, creating an "electric" atmosphere [00:01:01]. Following these early successes, Bill Gurley would often call Peter in the car to discuss the dinners [00:01:14].

The concept evolved from the understanding that while firms often have strategies, they may not always be "coupled to reality" [00:01:34]. A venture firm, fundamentally, is a "collection of habits" [00:01:39]. Drawing inspiration from William James, who posited that humans are an "amalgamation of our habits," the belief was that habits sow character and everything else [00:01:46]. Thus, to nurture curiosity, which is considered the "essential lifeblood of the firm," a consistent habit was needed [00:01:50].

## Purpose and Format
While Monday meetings at the office attempted to foster this, they were limited [00:01:58]. The dinners, however, offered a "dynamic range" [00:02:04]. They are characterized by an open-ended, no-agenda format, allowing for "wild explorations of the most bizarre things" partners might be curious about [00:02:10]. The dinners honor the firm's purpose of "constantly learning and activating our curiosity" and generate a "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved through one-on-one interactions [00:02:23]. This approach reflects the [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm Strategies and Culture | firm's ethos]] of deep, shared engagement.

## The Unique Table Design
A key challenge identified was the traditional table structure. Rectangular tables embed a power structure, while circular tables can atomize a group [00:02:47]. To address this, the firm sought a design that would "deconstruct power centers and create a non-hierarchical construct with intimacy" [00:03:09].

The solution was a unique table, initially seen as "the seven" by French designer Jean-Marie Massaud [00:02:58]. This organic design can expand and collapse [00:03:04]. The final table used by [[Importance and Dynamics of Venture Capital Partner Dinners | Benchmark]] was designed by Ole Lundberg, based on a hand sketch [00:03:18]. This table's design has been so admired by those who sit at it that it has significantly upgraded Lundberg's lifestyle due to demand [00:03:25]. The table's design reinforces the firm's [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm Strategies and Culture | ethos]]: sidebar conversations are impossible as "everybody else can hear it," ensuring "it's all one conversation" [00:04:25]. This structure ensures that "the whole group tuned in" on whatever is being discussed, whether good or tough news [00:05:01].

This singular focus contrasts sharply with experiences in other venture capital settings, where partners might "pre-sell" a deal through side conversations before a meeting [00:05:20]. At [[Importance and Dynamics of Venture Capital Partner Dinners | Benchmark]], a key rule is "no pre-selling a deal" [00:05:30].

## Esteemed Guests
The dinners often host "pretty esteemed guests," not just the five partners [00:03:39]. The firm sees these dinners as an opportunity to offer "the spotlight of attention," which is considered "the biggest gift you can give to another human being" [00:03:43]. More often than not, guests are individuals with whom the firm has not yet worked or invested [00:03:48]. Notable attendees have included Dylan Field and Tobi LÃ¼tke from Shopify [00:03:58]. Jeff Bezos has also attended, requiring the firm to travel with the table to Seattle or Los Angeles, as it is not portable [00:04:08].

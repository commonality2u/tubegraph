Hermès, the venerated luxury brand, dates back to 1837 in Paris, France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. Uniquely in the luxury industry, Hermès has maintained independence while other brands merged into conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. After 187 years, the company remains under family control, now led by its sixth generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This enduring family influence and a deep commitment to craftsmanship have been central to Hermès' [[herms_history_and_craftsmanship | history and craftsmanship]].

## The Founding Vision: Thierry Hermès (1st Generation)
Thierry Hermès, the founder, was born in 1801 in Kiel, Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. By the age of 20, he was an orphan, his entire family having perished due to the Napoleonic Wars, disease, or famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:03">[07:00:03]</a>. In 1821, Thierry moved to Normandy, France, and apprenticed for 16 years under a master craftsman, learning the art of *équipage* craftsmanship, which involved outfitting horse-drawn carriages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

In 1837, Thierry moved to Paris and opened his own shop, quickly becoming known as the best harness maker and carriage outfitter for the nobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. His timing was fortuitous, as Napoleon III's modernization of Paris created grand boulevards where the nobility's carriages could be prominently displayed, symbolizing wealth and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:06">[11:42:06]</a>. Empress Eugénie, Napoleon III's wife, became a significant client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:09">[14:54:09]</a>.

## Expanding the Craft: Charles-Émile Hermès (2nd Generation)
Thierry's son, Charles-Émile, took over the business in 1878 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. Like his father, Charles-Émile had apprenticed in the shop for 20 years, learning the craft firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. This tradition of family members learning the business as craftsmen continues to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. Charles-Émile expanded the business to include saddlery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:21">[19:21:21]</a> and moved the main workshop and store to the iconic 24 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris in 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.

## Embracing Modernity: Adolphe and Émile Hermès (3rd Generation)
In 1902, Charles-Émile retired, and his two sons, Adolphe and Émile, took the helm, renaming the company Hermès Frères (Hermès Brothers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>. Émile, the younger brother, was more adventurous. He successfully expanded the business into Russia by securing the Russian Tsar as a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.

A pivotal moment came in 1916 when Émile was sent to the United States by the French military to study American industrial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>. He met Henry Ford, observed the assembly lines, and foresaw the future of the automobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>. He also discovered the zipper (originally called the "closeall") and obtained an exclusive two-year license for its use in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>. Hermès created the world's first zippered jacket, a leather golf jacket for the Duke of Windsor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:00">[32:18:00]</a>. For years in France, the zipper was known as the "Hermès Fastener" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>.

Émile's vision for the automobile era led to a rift with his more conservative brother, Adolphe. In 1919, Émile bought out Adolphe, taking full control of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>. He then initiated the creation of the *Haut à Courroies* bag (high-belted bag) in 1902, originally designed to carry saddles and boots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. This bag, with its trapezoid shape and Turnlock closure, became the spiritual predecessor to the iconic Kelly and Birkin bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>. The shift to leather bags was a perfect transition as the world moved from horses to cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.

## Infusing Art and Whimsy: Robert Dumas (4th Generation)
Émile had four daughters, and the business passed to his son-in-law, Robert Dumas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:03:00">[43:03:00]</a>. Robert introduced a new dimension of whimsy and art to Hermès <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:00">[41:43:00]</a>. He redesigned the *Haut à Courroies* handbag line into the *Sac à Dépêches* in 1935 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>.

In the mid-1930s, Robert introduced the iconic *Chaîne d'Ancre* bracelet, inspired by boat anchors he saw on a beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[46:11:00]</a>. In 1937, he launched Hermès' classic silk scarves, which for decades were the company's biggest business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>. By 1988, silk accounted for 55% of sales, while leather was only 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:51:00">[49:51:00]</a>. These scarves, famously worn by Queen Elizabeth II as headscarves in the 1940s, showcased whimsical designs and exquisite craftsmanship, requiring 300 silk moth cocoons per scarf and hand screen printing for each color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:46:00">[50:46:00]</a>.

During World War II, a shortage of cream-colored packaging forced Hermès to use the only available color: orange. This led to the birth of the iconic Hermès Orange Box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:03:00">[56:03:00]</a>. After the war, Robert commissioned the famous "Duc Attelé" (Hitched Carriage) logo, which became the brand's enduring symbol, reflecting its heritage in the carriage world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:51:00">[59:51:00]</a>. Robert also hired theater set designers to create elaborate, artistic window displays at the Faubourg Saint-Honoré flagship, further cementing Hermès' connection to art and dreamlike experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

In 1956, Grace Kelly, Princess of Monaco, was photographed clutching her *Sac à Dépêches* bag to hide her pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. The photo became iconic, and in 1977, Robert officially renamed the bag the "Kelly bag," marking the birth of one of Hermès' most famous products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.

## Revitalization and Global Reach: Jean-Louis Dumas (5th Generation)
By the late 1970s, Hermès faced challenges, with consultants even recommending outsourcing production and lowering prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. Jean-Louis Dumas, Robert's son, took over in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Like his predecessors, he was trained in the saddle stitch, a unique, highly durable hand-stitching technique that forms the core of Hermès' leather craftsmanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. Hermès prides itself on its commitment to the highest quality, even if it means products are made entirely by one craftsman over several weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>. This dedication extends to product repair, with Hermès offering to mend any item, even those 100 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:26">[01:31:26]</a>.

Jean-Louis, having worked at Bloomingdale's in America, understood the need to modernize the brand's image without sacrificing its heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>. In 1979, he launched an advertising campaign featuring young Parisian women wearing Hermès scarves with jeans, a "not your mother's Tiffany" approach that revitalized the brand's appeal to a younger demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>.

In 1984, Jean-Louis famously conceived the Birkin bag during a flight from Paris to London after a conversation with actress Jane Birkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:34">[01:45:34]</a>. Jane was struggling to manage a wicker basket with baby bottles, expressing a need for a large, easily closable bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:45">[01:48:45]</a>. The Birkin, a larger tote-style bag with two handles, was designed as a more casual, modern alternative to the Kelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:15">[01:50:15]</a>. It was not an immediate success, taking about five years to gain widespread popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:17">[01:51:17]</a>. By 2001, the Birkin's scarcity and desirability were so renowned that it became a central storyline in an episode of *Sex and the City* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.

Jean-Louis also focused on international expansion, mirroring the success of brands like Louis Vuitton, recognizing the growing global wealthy elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:47">[01:43:47]</a>. Under his leadership, Hermès' revenue grew from under $100 million to $2 billion by his retirement in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:26">[02:06:26]</a>. In 1993, he listed Hermès on the Paris Stock Exchange, selling 19% of the company to the public to provide liquidity to the growing number of family shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:17">[02:08:17]</a>.

## Scaling Craftsmanship and Defending Independence: Axel Dumas and Pierre-Alexis Dumas (6th Generation)
When Jean-Louis retired in 2006, Patrick Thomas became the first non-family CEO, with Jean-Louis's son, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, taking on the role of artistic director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:24">[02:15:24]</a>. Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH, seized this perceived moment of vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:07">[02:15:07]</a>. Starting in 2001, Arnault quietly built a stake in Hermès using equity swaps, eventually revealing a 14.2% ownership in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:23">[02:12:23]</a>. By 2011, LVMH's stake reached 22.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:39">[02:31:39]</a>, causing the stock price to skyrocket and putting immense pressure on individual family members to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:14">[02:32:14]</a>.

In a remarkable display of family unity, over 50 of the 80 Hermès family members contributed 50.2% of their equity into a new cooperative vehicle called H51 in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:10">[02:34:10]</a>. This equity was contractually locked up for at least 20 years, sending a clear message to Arnault that control was unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:37">[02:34:37]</a>. In 2014, French courts ruled LVMH's stake acquisition illegal, forcing its distribution to shareholders, which ultimately benefited Arnault's family office financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>.

Axel Dumas, Jean-Louis's nephew, became the CEO in 2013, with Pierre-Alexis Dumas as Artistic Director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:23">[02:16:23]</a>. This generation has overseen the "insane idea" of scaling handcrafted artisanal production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:38">[02:44:38]</a>. Hermès now employs 7,000 master craftspeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:16">[02:46:16]</a>. To maintain the intimate workshop environment, no production site has more than 250-300 craftspeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>. Their explicit goal is to increase production capacity by 7% annually, requiring the hiring of 500 new artisans each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:15">[02:47:15]</a>.

To achieve this, Hermès has built its own pipeline of training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:20">[02:48:20]</a>. They establish trade schools in rural, high-unemployment areas of France, ensuring 100% graduation rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:31">[02:48:31]</a>. The average age of an Hermès artisan is now 30, and 80% are women, a significant shift from previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>. In 2021, they launched their first official French government-sanctioned degree program, the *École Hermès des Savoir-Faire*, further solidifying their commitment to preserving and growing these art forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:22">[02:49:22]</a>. Today, there are 31 Hermès *ateliers* (workshops) across France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:03">[02:50:03]</a>.

This commitment to craftsmanship and controlled growth has allowed Hermès to thrive, even in challenging economic times. Their strategy, as articulated by Axel Dumas, is about "picking your fight" and focusing on what they do best: creating handcrafted, exquisite objects with an exclusive distribution network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. They believe the scarcity of their products is a *result* of their adherence to uncompromising quality and traditional methods, rather than an artificial constraint to drive demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

Hermès' employee turnover is exceptionally low, at 6% annually, with only 4.5% leaving voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:53">[04:40:53]</a>. This is significantly lower than the industry average and reflects the deep commitment and unique skill sets of their artisans, who often stay for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:07">[04:41:07]</a>.

The company's approach to retail is also unique, with a "pull model" where each of their 300+ stores is tailored to its local clientele, and store managers have autonomy to select stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. Hermès also famously maintains no marketing department, instead believing "everyone at the company is responsible for marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. They spend a fraction of what competitors do on traditional advertising, relying on their brand's lore, word-of-mouth, and strategic event sponsorships to build their image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:01">[03:31:01]</a>.

While Hermès has expanded its product categories to include perfumes and beauty, and even partnered with Apple for watch bands, these ventures are carefully managed to not dilute the brand's core identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. They represent an effort to reach new, younger demographics and maintain [[herms_brand_strategy_and_market_positioning | relevance in the modern world]]. Hermès' enduring success lies in its ability to balance traditional craftsmanship and family values with strategic adaptation and global reach, all while maintaining an [[herms_approach_to_sustainability_and_ethics | unwavering commitment to quality and exclusivity]].

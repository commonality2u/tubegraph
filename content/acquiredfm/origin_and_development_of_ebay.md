## Pierre Omidyar's Entrepreneurial Path

Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, had prior experience in the tech industry before creating the online marketplace. In the mid-1990s, he worked at a pen computing company called Ink [00:00:16], where Bruce Dunleavy from Merrell Pickard Anderson and Air was an investor [00:00:21]. The pen computing space largely did not pan out, with the exception of Palm Pilot [00:00:33]. Ink, facing this challenge, pivoted into very early [[the_evolution_of_ecommerce_and_internet_usage | e-commerce]] software enablement for enterprises [00:00:50] and was eventually sold to Microsoft [00:01:01]. Omidyar worked there as an engineer and developed a relationship with Bruce Dunleavy [00:01:08].

After Ink, and before starting eBay, Omidyar worked at General Magic [00:01:16], which is described as a major innovation hub in Silicon Valley [00:01:27]. General Magic is credited with inventing the concepts of cloud and mobile computing in retrospect [00:01:50]. Omidyar's background in pen computing made his move to General Magic logical [00:01:57].

## The Genesis of eBay

While working full-time as an engineer at General Magic [00:03:09], Pierre Omidyar famously began tinkering with the early internet in his free time [00:02:04]. He started a collection of internet services he called "eBay" [00:02:13]. The name "eBay" was initially intended to mean "electronic Bay Area" [00:02:16].

The early eBay website, described as a "courier font website," contained a variety of content and programmatic elements [00:02:26]. One of the main services offered was "Auction Web" [00:02:43], which eventually became the core of eBay [00:02:49]. At this stage, eBay was merely a side project for Omidyar [00:03:03].

## From Side Project to Business

Initially, Omidyar hosted auctions on eBay for free, with no established business model [00:03:41]. However, the site gained so much traffic that his server costs became prohibitive [00:03:45]. This led him to reluctantly ask users to pay a small listing fee to cover expenses [00:03:48]. Users responded by sending checks to his apartment, deluging him with mail he couldn't open fast enough [00:03:59]. This overwhelming response demonstrated clear product-market fit [00:04:04].

This unexpected success prompted Omidyar to consider building eBay into a formal business [00:05:05]. He brought on Jeff Skoll, a newly minted MBA from Stanford Business School, to handle the business operations, which literally included opening and cashing the checks [00:04:12]. The need to cover server costs is highlighted as a critical moment that prevented eBay from becoming a non-profit resource like Wikipedia or Craigslist [00:04:29].

## Seeking Investment

Although eBay was generating cash flow and Omidyar didn't immediately need external funds, his experiences at Ink and General Magic taught him the value of VCs and a professional board [00:05:12]. He remembered Bruce Dunleavy from his Ink days [00:05:23].

Omidyar and Skoll pitched eBay to numerous venture capital firms on Sand Hill Road, but nearly all of them turned them down [00:05:27]. However, Benchmark expressed interest [00:05:37]. Bruce Dunleavy, along with his partner Bob Kagle, who was interested in consumer psychology [00:05:47], and later David Beirne, who could recruit a management team [00:05:56], championed the investment [00:06:04].

Benchmark offered a term sheet to invest $6.7 million in a Series A financing round at a $20 million pre-money valuation [00:06:10].

## The Knight-Ridder Offer

Omidyar and Skoll also received a competing acquisition offer from Knight Ridder, a large newspaper conglomerate [00:06:24]. Knight Ridder offered to acquire eBay for $50 million [00:07:36]. This offer was compelling, especially given that eBay was a two-person company at the time [00:07:52].

At this point, eBay was experiencing rapid growth, increasing by 10% month-over-month, and was already profitable [00:07:11]. The decision not to take the $50 million offer from Knight Ridder was highly non-consensus at the time [00:10:56].

## Benchmark's Investment Strategy

There is some debate about the specifics of Benchmark's $6.7 million investment [00:07:57]. While it's likely that the company itself never burned any of Benchmark's capital because it was always profitable [00:08:23], Benchmark acquired 20% or more of eBay's equity [00:08:49]. At the time of eBay's IPO, Benchmark was reported to own 22.1% [00:08:57].

[!INFO] Secondary Loans
The Washington Post reported after eBay's IPO that Benchmark also structured equity-backed loans to Pierre Omidyar and Jeff Skoll, each for $750,000 [00:09:07]. This effectively served as a secondary transaction, providing Omidyar and Skoll with an incentive not to take Knight Ridder's acquisition offer [00:09:16]. This totaled $1.5 million paid to the founders [00:09:36]. Another account from a Benchmark partner suggested that $3 million of the $6.7 million round was used as a secondary [00:09:50]. However, there are also claims that no secondary transaction occurred [00:09:57]. SEC filings supported the notion of equity-backed loans in addition to the direct equity investment [00:10:06]. This approach, allowing entrepreneurs to take some money off the table, was highly untraditional and non-consensus for VCs at the time [00:10:32].

## Post-Investment Growth and IPO

The investment deal was finalized in the summer of 1997 [00:11:29]. Just over a year later, in September 1998, eBay went public [00:11:37]. Leading up to the IPO, Benchmark and David Beirne were highly involved in recruiting Meg Whitman from Hasbro to serve as CEO [00:11:43]. Whitman, previously known for her strategic planning at Disney and work at Bain [00:11:53], was instrumental in leading the business [00:12:03].

Wall Street embraced eBay's story [00:12:08]. At the IPO in September 1998, Benchmark's initial $6.7 million investment was valued at $400 million [00:12:14]. Due to a six-month lockup period, Benchmark could not distribute their shares immediately [00:12:22]. By the time the lockup expired in the spring of 1999, their stake had surged to over $4 billion [00:12:28].

This represented an extraordinary return on Benchmark's $85 million fund [00:12:34]:
*   A $6.7 million investment grew to $4 billion in less than two years [00:12:38].
*   This single investment alone resulted in a 47x return on their entire fund [00:12:51].
*   If the reported equity-backed loans were indeed incremental to the equity investment, this could have added another $1 billion to their returns, an additional 12x on the fund [00:13:10].

Benchmark successfully distributed $4 billion to their limited partners (LPs) [00:13:37]. Even with conservative estimates, assuming no secondary kicker, this translated to $1.5 billion in "carry" dollars distributed amongst the general partners (GPs) [00:14:47]. Pieces of carry were even given to their assistants, making some of them multi-millionaires [00:15:03].

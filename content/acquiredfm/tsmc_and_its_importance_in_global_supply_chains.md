TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, stands as a critical pillar in the global supply chain, particularly within the semiconductor industry. Its unique business model, customer-centric philosophy, and dominant market position underscore its profound importance. The podcast "Acquired" dedicated an episode to TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> and later featured investors Brenton Johns and John Bathgate from NZS Capital, who spend significant time researching semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> and view TSMC as a key holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.

## Core Business and Market Position

[[History and Evolution of TSMC|TSMC]] operates as a pure-play foundry, meaning it focuses exclusively on manufacturing chips designed by other companies, rather than designing its own products or competing with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>. This model has allowed it to become a "classic scale company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, embodying a "power law" where it captures a significant portion of profits in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Currently, TSMC's fabs produce a quarter of the digital chips made globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>.

## Business Philosophy and Client Relationships

NZS Capital's investment philosophy, rooted in complexity theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, highlights [[Technological and Business Strategies of TSMC|TSMC's]] approach to "non-zero sumness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This means creating a win-win outcome for all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

Despite having lower gross margins than most of its customers, around 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>, TSMC could potentially raise them to 60% due to its near-monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. However, [[TSMC pricing strategy|Morris Chang]], TSMC's founder, architected a culture focused on long-term value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a> and enabling its customers to build "massive amazing businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:55">[02:22:55]</a>. This strategy of "creating more value than you take" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:28">[02:24:28]</a> fosters immense trust from its clients, such as [[TSMCs relationship with major clients like Nvidia and Apple|Apple]] and [[TSMCs relationship with major clients like Nvidia and Apple|Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. Unlike competitors like Samsung, which competes with its customers in various product categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>, TSMC's neutrality prevents conflicts of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

## Importance in the Semiconductor Ecosystem

TSMC's role extends beyond manufacturing; it acts as an orchestrator of the broader semiconductor ecosystem.

### Driving Moore's Law
[[The impact of technological advancements on TSMCs growth|Moore's Law]], while debated in its literal sense, continues in spirit, with visibility for another 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. This continuity is heavily reliant on the "ecosystem approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a>. TSMC's "open innovation platform" (Open Innovation Platform, OIP) is central to this, facilitating collaboration across the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>.

### Key Partners and Specialization
The complexity of semiconductor manufacturing means no single company can do it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>. Key partners include:
*   **ASML**: Provides Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>, crucial for shrinking transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>. In 2012, Intel, TSMC, and Samsung collectively bought 25% of ASML to inject capital for EUV development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>.
*   **Cadence Design Systems** (and Synopsys): Provide Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software, essential for designing chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>. These are high-quality duopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a> with their own substantial IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>.
*   **Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research, Tokyo Electron**: Supply other critical equipment for processes like deposition and etch steps, vital for advanced packaging and multi-die chiplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:28">[01:35:28]</a>.
*   **Arm**: Provides off-the-shelf IP blocks for chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>.

This network forms a "super organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a> where all participants generally do well because of the inherent difficulty in driving Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications

[[Geopolitical Implications of TSMCs Dominance|TSMC's]] location in Taiwan presents significant [[Technological and geopolitical issues facing TSMC and the semiconductor industry|geopolitical issues facing TSMC and the semiconductor industry]], a fact even discussed on their earnings calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a>. Many consider [[Impact of TSMC on Global Semiconductor Manufacturing|TSMC]] one of the top five most important technology platforms globally, arguably more critical than [[TSMCs relationship with major clients like Nvidia and Apple|Apple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>. If TSMC's fabs were disrupted, the Western world's technological progress could be set back five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>, causing "extremely painful" impacts on the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.

This risk drives concepts like "semiconductor sovereignty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>, with efforts to build fabs elsewhere, such as TSMC's new 5-nanometer fab in Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>, and potential future fabs in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>. However, recreating the entire ecosystem elsewhere would take a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>. Furthermore, TSMC is considered a "national champion" of Taiwan, with the government still holding a significant stake, making any acquisition attempts impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:21">[01:46:21]</a>.

## Resilience and Long-Term Growth

NZS Capital classifies TSMC as a "resilient" company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a> within their investment strategy. They prefer "slow, methodical, governed growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:31">[01:53:31]</a> over "hyper growth" because long-term compounding of even moderate growth (e.g., 20% a year for 30 years) generates tremendous value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a>. TSMC's consistent growth, enabling trillions of dollars in market capitalization for its partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:08">[01:47:08]</a>, perfectly exemplifies this philosophy. This ability to create more value for its customers than it captures for itself is a hallmark of a true platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">[01:38:32]</a>, and a key factor in its enduring resilience.

In conclusion, TSMC's unique role as a pure-play foundry, its "non-zero sum" business model, and its central position in a highly specialized global ecosystem make it an indispensable component of modern technology and global supply chains. Its strategic importance extends far beyond its market capitalization, representing the foundation upon which much of the information age is built.

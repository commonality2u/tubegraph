The early days of [[origin_and_development_of_ebay | eBay]] were marked by unconventional origins, significant challenges, and debated financial structures. Unlike many venture-backed startups, [[origin_and_development_of_ebay | eBay]] evolved from a side project into a profitable enterprise almost by accident, facing [[challenges_faced_when_starting_a_paid_online_business | challenges faced when starting a paid online business]] that shaped its unique trajectory.

## Pierre Omidyar's Background and Conception of eBay

Pierre Omidyar, the founder of [[origin_and_development_of_ebay | eBay]], was an engineer with a background in pen computing and early [[the_evolution_of_ecommerce_and_internet_usage | e-commerce]] software enablement [00:00:11]. Before [[origin_and_development_of_ebay | eBay]], he worked at a pen computing company called Ink, which pivoted into enterprise software for early [[the_evolution_of_ecommerce_and_internet_usage | e-commerce]] and was eventually sold to Microsoft [00:00:16] [00:00:50] [00:00:53] [00:00:56] [00:00:59] [00:01:01]. After Ink, Omidyar joined General Magic, a company recognized for inventing concepts like cloud and mobile [00:01:14] [00:01:21] [00:01:30] [00:01:48] [00:01:50].

While working full-time at General Magic, Omidyar began "tinkering around on the early internet" [00:02:04] [00:02:08] [00:03:09]. He started a collection of internet services he called "eBay" (short for "electronic Bay Area") [00:02:10] [00:02:13] [00:02:16]. The initial website was described as having "a lot of crap," being "courier font," and featuring various content under the [[origin_and_development_of_ebays | eBay]] umbrella [00:02:22] [00:02:24] [00:02:26] [00:02:28] [00:02:30]. One of its core components, and ultimately the most successful, was "auction web" [00:02:41] [00:02:43] [00:02:45] [00:02:49].

At this stage, Omidyar was perceived as an engineer, not someone VCs would consider "CEO material" [00:03:00] [00:03:03] [00:03:12] [00:03:14] [00:03:17]. This contrasted sharply with figures like Jeff Bezos, who approached Amazon with a full business plan [00:03:22] [00:03:23] [00:03:25].

## The Accidental Business Model

Initially, Omidyar hosted auctions for free, with no established business model [00:03:41] [00:03:43]. However, the site's rapid growth led to server costs skyrocketing [00:03:45] [00:03:47]. Facing these [[challenges_faced_when_starting_a_paid_online_business | challenges faced when starting a paid online business]], Omidyar reluctantly asked users to pay a small listing fee to cover expenses [00:03:48] [00:03:52] [00:03:54].

The response was overwhelming: users sent checks to his apartment, so many that he couldn't open them fast enough [00:03:59] [00:04:02] [00:04:04]. This unexpected influx of payments was recognized as clear "product market fit" [00:04:06] [00:04:10]. To manage this, Omidyar brought on Jeff Skoll, a recent Stanford MBA graduate, whose primary role was to "open the checks and cash them" [00:04:11] [00:04:12] [00:04:15] [00:04:17] [00:04:19] [00:04:23]. This demonstrated that had Pierre not needed to pay for server costs, [[origin_and_development_of_ebay | eBay]] might have remained a non-profit resource like Craigslist or Wikipedia [00:04:29] [00:04:31] [00:04:33] [00:04:34] [00:04:36] [00:04:37] [00:04:39] [00:04:41]. Instead, it became a leading internet company [00:04:43] [00:04:46].

## Funding Challenges and the Unique Benchmark Deal

Despite its growth and profitability, securing venture capital proved difficult for [[origin_and_development_of_ebay | eBay]]. Pierre and Jeff Skoll pitched to numerous VCs on Sand Hill Road, but "just about everybody else actually literally everybody else turns them down" [00:05:27] [00:05:30] [00:05:33].

Benchmark was the only firm interested, specifically partner Bruce Dunleavy, who knew Omidyar from his Ink days, and Bob Kagle, who was interested in consumer psychology [00:05:37] [00:05:41] [00:05:44] [00:05:47] [00:05:50] [00:05:53]. They offered a term sheet to invest $6.7 million in a Series A financing at a $20 million pre-money valuation [00:06:10] [00:06:13] [00:06:16] [00:06:18].

A significant challenge and misconception arose from a competing acquisition offer. Knight Ridder, a major newspaper conglomerate, offered $50 million to acquire [[origin_and_development_of_ebay | eBay]] [00:06:32] [00:06:36] [00:06:38] [00:07:36] [00:07:39]. This was a "pretty compelling offer," especially given that exits of this size for a "two-person company that was barely a company" were rare at the time [00:07:33] [00:07:42] [00:07:46] [00:07:47] [00:07:49] [00:07:52] [00:07:54].

To incentivize Omidyar and Skoll not to take the acquisition, Benchmark engaged in a highly untraditional and non-consensus move [00:08:00] [00:10:32] [00:10:35]. While it's debated if all of Benchmark's $6.7 million investment went to [[origin_and_development_of_ebay | eBay]]'s balance sheet (as the company was already profitable and likely didn't burn much of it) [00:08:18] [00:08:20] [00:08:23] [00:08:24] [00:08:25] [00:08:26] [00:08:28] [00:08:29] [00:08:33] [00:08:36] [00:08:38] [00:08:40], what is known is that Benchmark received 20% or more equity [00:08:49] [00:08:52].

More significantly, reports from sources like The Washington Post, and even SEC filings, indicated that Benchmark structured "equity-backed loans" to Pierre and Jeff, each for $750,000 [00:09:00] [00:09:03] [00:09:07] [00:09:10] [00:09:12] [00:10:05] [00:10:06] [00:10:08] [00:10:13] [00:10:15]. This effectively functioned as a "secondary" transaction, allowing the founders to take some money off the table and reducing their incentive to sell the company [00:09:27] [00:09:28] [00:09:31] [00:09:33] [00:09:36] [00:10:41] [00:10:43] [00:10:45] [00:10:47] [00:10:49]. While the exact amount of this secondary is debated (with some sources suggesting $1.5 million or even $3 million out of the $6.7 million round) [00:09:36] [00:09:38] [00:09:43] [00:09:47] [00:09:50] [00:09:52], it was an unusual practice at the time, making Benchmark the only VC willing to structure such a deal [00:10:56] [00:10:57] [00:10:59]. This unique approach was critical to securing the founders' commitment to building [[origin_and_development_of_ebay | eBay]] into a larger business rather than selling early [00:10:50] [00:10:52] [00:10:54].

## Rapid Growth and Financial Outcomes

After securing the [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay | Benchmarks investment strategy and impact on eBay]] in the summer of 1997 [00:11:29], [[origin_and_development_of_ebay | eBay]] saw rapid growth. By September 1998, just over a year later, the company, with Benchmark's involvement, recruited Meg Whitman as CEO from Hasbro [00:11:37] [00:11:41] [00:11:43] [00:11:46] [00:11:49] [00:11:53] [00:12:03] [00:12:07].

The company's IPO in September 1998 was a massive success [00:12:11]. Benchmark's initial $6.7 million investment was valued at $400 million at the IPO [00:12:14] [00:12:17] [00:12:20]. Due to a lockup period, they couldn't distribute their shares immediately [00:12:22] [00:12:24]. By the time the lockup expired in spring 1999, the stake had surged to over $4 billion [00:12:25] [00:12:28] [00:12:31] [00:12:34]. This incredible return—a $6.7 million investment turning into $4 billion in less than two years—resulted in an "unreal" IRR and 47x return on their fund [00:12:38] [00:12:40] [00:12:43] [00:12:46] [00:12:51]. If the secondary "kicker" from the equity-backed loans were included, it could add another $1 billion [00:13:10] [00:13:14] [00:13:17], resulting in an additional 12x return [00:13:17] [00:13:20]. Benchmark famously distributed this $4 billion to its limited partners [00:13:28] [00:13:30] [00:13:37] [00:13:39] [00:14:10] [00:14:12]. This extraordinary success made [[financial_outcomes_from_ebays_growth_and_IPO | financial outcomes from eBays growth and IPO]] for Benchmark and its partners legendary, even extending to giving carry to their assistants [00:14:51] [00:15:03] [00:15:05] [00:15:07] [00:15:09].

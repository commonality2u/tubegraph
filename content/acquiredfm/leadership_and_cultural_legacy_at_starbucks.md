Starbucks, an institution valued at $90 billion, owes its modern existence largely to [[History of Starbucks and Howard Schultz's journey | Howard Schultz]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Starting in 1982 at a small chain of three stores, Schultz eventually purchased the company and became its CEO, effectively becoming the founder of the Starbucks known globally today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Howard Schultz's Vision and Early Influences
Schultz's vision for Starbucks was deeply personal, shaped by his childhood experiences growing up in the projects in a more or less dysfunctional family due to financial pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. He aimed to build a different kind of company, one that would provide respect and dignity, contrasting with his father's experience of feeling disrespected and vilified as an uneducated blue-collar veteran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. This desire to "crack the code" on creating benefits for employees stemmed from his upbringing, where his family had no health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

His early career at Xerox, while teaching him about selling, also instilled humility due to significant daily rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This experience, combined with his desire for more than just a stable job, fueled his drive to pursue something he felt destined to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## The "Third Place" Concept
Schultz's epiphany came during a trip to Italy in 1983, where he was "blown away" by the experience of Italian coffee bars—the romance of coffee and the sense of community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. He immediately recognized that this was the business Starbucks needed to be in, but the original founders, who only sold coffee beans, disagreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

After two years of persistence, he was allowed to open a small coffee bar within the sixth Starbucks store in Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This experiment, introducing lattes and cappuccinos, quickly attracted 500 customers a week, significantly more than the 200-300 customers buying coffee beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. This concept of the "third place"—a community gathering spot between home and work—became the cornerstone of Starbucks' cultural and business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

## Investing in People: The Partner Model
A core tenet of Starbucks' [[Hiring and building company culture | culture]] and [[Importance of company culture and decisionmaking in tech companies | decision-making]] under Schultz was the belief in exceeding employee expectations so they, in turn, could exceed customer expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.

Key initiatives included:
*   **Bean Stock (Employee Stock Options)**: In 1991, a year before the IPO, Schultz proposed giving equity in the form of stock options to every employee, including part-time workers, despite resistance from venture capitalists on the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. This program, called Bean Stock, was groundbreaking, especially for part-time employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:04]</a>. These initial grants, at $6 per share, have since multiplied 800 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. This move marked a turning point, transforming employees into "partners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:26]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Healthcare**: In 1988, when the company had only 33 stores, Starbucks rolled out health benefits for part-time employees, including gay couples in domestic partnerships, years before the Affordable Care Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>.
*   **College Achievement Plan (CAP)**: Starbucks partnered with Arizona State University to offer four-year free college tuition to every partner, with thousands graduating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:41">[02:52:41]</a>.

This focus on humanity and partner well-being is seen as the underlying reason for Starbucks' success, fostering a culture of compassion, empathy, and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:22">[02:26:22]</a>. The company has employed over 5 million people in its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>.

## Key Leaders and Cultural Stewards
While Schultz provided the vision and ambition, other leaders were crucial to building and maintaining the culture:
*   **Howard Behar**: Joined in 1989, Behar is credited with much of the "cultural texture and tapestry of the humanity" of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. He championed servant leadership and ensured the company remained "people first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. He was instrumental in fixing the Chicago market initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.
*   **Orin Smith**: Joined in 1990, Smith was the "adult in the room," a wise man who could temper Schultz's ambition with practical realities, ensuring the company built necessary infrastructure and systems for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. The three — Schultz, Behar, and Smith — had dinner together almost every Monday night for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.
*   **Belinda Wong**: Deemed by Schultz as perhaps the most valuable person in the company, Wong single-handedly built the China business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:55">[01:38:55]</a>. She successfully decentralized operations from Seattle, allowing for localization and strategic decisions like providing health insurance to parents and grandparents of Chinese partners, a first in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:38">[02:16:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## [[Impact of global expansion and customizations at Starbucks | Impact of Global Expansion and Customizations]]
Starbucks' global success, particularly in tea-drinking cultures like China and Japan, is a testament to the universality of its core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:18">[02:14:18]</a>. The company prioritized owning its stores rather than franchising, believing it was essential to "build, maintain, and elevate the culture of the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:04">[02:13:04]</a>. This contrasts with commodity-based businesses like McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:59">[02:13:59]</a>.

A key cultural aspect that fueled [[Starbucks business model and growth strategy | growth]] was customer customization. Customers began personalizing beverages, leading to increased average ticket sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. This evolved into an astounding 100,000 different beverage variations being made consistently by baristas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a>.

## [[Challenges and transformations in Starbucks operations | Challenges and Transformations]]
Starbucks' journey has not been without [[Challenges and transformations in Starbucks operations | challenges]] to its cultural legacy:
*   **Growth and Ubiquity**: Schultz always viewed ubiquity as an "enemy" to the company, fearing it would commoditize the experience and lead to a loss of intimacy and trust with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. He stressed the importance of constantly "getting smaller as we're getting bigger" to maintain the core experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Mobile Order & Pay**: While a technological success, the mobile app, which accounts for 33% of orders today, became an "Achilles heel" for the company by depersonalizing the experience and creating congestion in stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:08">[02:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:10">[02:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:18">[02:01:18]</a>. Schultz regrets not "slow rolling" its availability to understand its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:41">[02:06:41]</a>.
*   **Leadership Transitions and Cultural Drift**: Schultz stepped down as CEO in 2000, feeling "physically and emotionally exhausted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. He returned in 2008 during the financial crisis, finding the company just seven months from insolvency due to underperforming stores and efficiency cuts that diluted coffee quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:38">[01:44:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. He famously addressed 10,000 store managers, laying out the dire truth and emphasizing the importance of each individual store and customer connection for the turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:34">[01:48:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:08">[01:49:08]</a>. He believes "success breeds hubris" and that the company started playing defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:25">[03:00:25]</a>.
*   **Unionization Efforts**: In a more recent return as interim CEO from 2022-2023, Schultz encountered unionization efforts, noting mistakes made by management during the COVID-19 era and an underestimation of public sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:25">[02:23:25]</a>.

> "The worst thing that Starbucks could have become... is a utility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:34">[02:32:34]</a>.

## Enduring Legacy
Starbucks' cultural legacy is that of a "performance-driven company through the lens of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:09">[01:47:09]</a>. This means prioritizing its "partners in the green apron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:48">[02:24:50]</a>. The longevity of employee tenure at Starbucks is twice that of the industry average, a direct result of these investments in people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:19">[02:52:19]</a>.

Schultz firmly believes that Starbucks created an industry that did not exist before it, inspiring tens of thousands of stores globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:45">[02:53:45]</a>. He envisions a world where a franchised, commoditized coffee business might have emerged, but "nothing would have been executed like Starbucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:56">[02:54:59]</a>. The "Roastery" concept, inspired by "Willie Wonka," was designed to elevate the brand and fight ubiquity by offering an immersive, theatrical experience that cannot be replicated at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:22">[02:33:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:53">[02:33:56]</a>.

Despite the complexities of operating across agriculture, manufacturing, retail, wholesale, and multiple joint ventures globally, Schultz emphasizes that Starbucks is fundamentally "in the people business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:15">[03:02:15]</a>. The company's success is not an entitlement, and the bar for performance and cultural adherence continuously rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:59">[03:05:03]</a>.

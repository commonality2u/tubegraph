Salesforce, a prominent enterprise software company, has strategically utilized acquisitions to expand its offerings and market presence. One of its most notable recent acquisitions is that of Slack, a deal valued at $27.7 billion [06:03]. This acquisition, announced in late 2020, represents the largest software deal since IBM's purchase of Red Hat in 2018 [07:28].

## The Acquisition of Slack

### Deal Details and Context
Slack was acquired for approximately $27.7 billion [06:03], with a purchase price working out to about $45.86 per share in a mix of cash and stock, leaning heavier on stock (roughly 57% stock) [06:07]. This price represented a 55% premium to where Slack was trading before the news of the acquisition leaked [06:23] and an 85% premium to its stock price after an earnings crash in September [06:30]. This price was above Slack's direct public offering (DPO) first-day trading price [06:39].

Post-acquisition, Slack is expected to remain independent, with its CEO, Stewart Butterfield, continuing to lead the company [07:10]. The deal is anticipated to close in the following year and requires approval from Slack shareholders [07:16].

### Strategic Rationale for Salesforce
Salesforce views the Slack acquisition as transformative, aiming to create "the operating system for the new way to work" by uniquely enabling companies to grow in an "all digital world" [02:46]. The core idea is that Slack will be "deeply integrated into every Salesforce cloud as the new interface for Salesforce Customer 360" [02:01].

The acquisition provides Salesforce with several strategic advantages:
*   **Distribution Power**: Salesforce gains access to a massive professional sales force to push Slack's product into organizations where it previously struggled to gain a foothold [01:00:00]. This is considered a [[Art of Enterprise Sales | distribution deal]] that will leverage Salesforce's existing channels to get Slack into more enterprises [02:46].
*   **Market Expansion**: Slack's historical growth came from small, innovative organizations and startups, growing with them as they expanded [02:30:00]. Salesforce's acquisition aims to unlock a credible way for Slack to penetrate larger organizations [02:16:00].
*   **Slack Connect**: A key component of the acquisition is Slack Connect, which allows companies to communicate with external partners and clients [02:12:00]. Salesforce envisions a seamless integration where sales leads can initiate Slack Connect channels directly within the Salesforce product, streamlining client communication [02:29:00]. Slack Connect experienced significant growth, from 380,000 endpoints to 520,000 in the quarter leading up to the acquisition [02:47:00].
*   **Countering Microsoft**: The acquisition is seen as a move to counter Microsoft's dominance in the enterprise software space [02:07:00]. Salesforce aims to position itself as the "credible centerpiece" of a "best of breed" ecosystem, as opposed to Microsoft's bundled, integrated system that some argue is "best at nothing" but well-integrated [02:10:00]. This acquisition is part of a larger "anti-Microsoft consolidation" trend [02:11:00].
*   **Growth by Acquisition**: Salesforce, like other "outsider CEOs" in business, is growing its company by acquiring high-growth assets to boost its overall revenue and market presence [01:04:09].

### Why Slack Sold
Despite strong performance metrics (49% year-over-year growth [04:18], top quartile in SaaS metrics [04:50], free cash flow positive [03:26:00]), Slack's stock price suffered due to the perceived threat from Microsoft Teams [04:49]. Microsoft aggressively targeted Slack, publicly displaying charts showing Teams surpassing Slack in user numbers, which depressed Slack's share price [01:11:00].

The decision to sell to Salesforce at a 55% premium [01:51:00] can be attributed to:
*   **Market Pressure**: Constant "hammering" by Wall Street due to the Microsoft Teams narrative [01:44:00].
*   **Competitive Fatigue**: The ongoing battle with Microsoft, which exerted its distribution advantage [01:12:00], was a significant annoyance and pain point for Slack [01:43:00].
*   **Accelerated Mission**: Partnering with Salesforce offers a path to "realize the mission the soonest" by leveraging Salesforce's immense distribution and sales capabilities [01:21:00]. This allows Stewart Butterfield to remain focused on product development, rather than becoming an "enterprise SaaS guy" [01:43:00].

## Comparison to Past Acquisitions

The Slack acquisition is often compared to Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn for around $24 billion, which also occurred in 2016 [02:22:00]. In both cases, a large, established tech company (Microsoft/Salesforce) acquired a significant enterprise application that operates somewhat independently, leveraging the acquirer's distribution [02:04:00]. Salesforce itself was a bidder for LinkedIn [08:40].

Salesforce has a history of strategic acquisitions, including:
*   **Quip**: A document collaboration tool [02:10:00].
*   **Heroku**: A cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS) [02:19:00].
*   **Tableau**: A data visualization software (though Looker, owned by Google, is preferred by some) [01:06:14].

A key question surrounding these acquisitions is whether the acquired products ultimately atrophy or integrate effectively [02:25:00]. Concerns exist that Salesforce's acquisitions, while boosting revenue, may lead to a decrease in product velocity or innovation compared to independent companies [02:11:00].

## Broader Industry Implications

### The "Anti-Microsoft Alliance"
Salesforce's acquisition of Slack can be seen as a rallying point for a new ecosystem of "best of breed" software companies [02:11:00]. Unlike Microsoft's integrated suite, Salesforce aims to be a central hub for specialized, top-tier applications. This strategy could open doors for other niche SaaS companies like Superhuman or Coda to access larger markets through Salesforce's distribution [02:17:00].

### Rebundling of Enterprise Software
The acquisition highlights a potential "rebundling" trend in enterprise software [02:12:00]. After years where individual teams could easily acquire SaaS services with credit cards, leading to "subscription fatigue" and procurement headaches [02:15:00], companies like Salesforce are offering consolidated solutions. This new bundling might not occur at the traditional software level but possibly at the "credit card level" or through software solutions that manage spend [02:26:00].

### Missed Opportunities and Future Competition
*   **Google**: Many believe Google was a more natural fit for Slack, given its G Suite (Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets) which could have created a powerful, integrated office bundle [01:05:00]. Slack already had robust integrations with G Suite [01:07:00]. Google's vast cash reserves could have easily financed such a deal [01:09:00].
*   **Amazon**: With AWS powering Slack's video product and Slack using AWS, Amazon was another potential acquirer, given its [[Amazons_business_strategies_and_innovations | business strategies and innovations]] [01:06:54].
*   **Zoom**: Despite its high market capitalization, Zoom's underdeveloped corporate development function likely prevented it from pursuing such a large acquisition [01:10:00]. Zoom's focus remains on becoming a platform for video [01:12:00].

### Challenges for Slack in the Salesforce Ecosystem
*   **Loss of Startup Appeal**: There is a risk that startups and innovative companies, which were Slack's early adopters, might shy away from the product now that it's part of a larger enterprise like Salesforce [02:09:00].
*   **Product Atrophy**: Concerns exist that being under Salesforce could stifle Slack's innovation or lead to its product features stagnating, similar to what some perceive happened with Quip or Heroku post-acquisition [02:25:00].
*   **Forced Cross-Selling**: The potential for Salesforce to aggressively cross-sell its other products to Slack users could alienate the existing user base [02:10:00].

In summary, the [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Salesforce strategic acquisitions]], particularly Slack, marks a significant moment in the enterprise software landscape, signaling a potential shift towards new forms of consolidation and intensified competition against integrated suites like Microsoft 365, while also posing challenges related to product innovation and user perception.

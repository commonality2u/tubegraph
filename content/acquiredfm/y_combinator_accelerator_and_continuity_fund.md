Y Combinator (YC) is a prominent organization in the startup ecosystem, known for its accelerator program and, more recently, its continuity fund. YC was founded 17 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>, and it views itself as a "university for startups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

## The Accelerator Program

YC's accelerator program is considered the "undergraduate program" within its university model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>. It is a 12-week program designed to support founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.

Key aspects of the accelerator:
*   **Mass Production of Investments** YC was the first to implement a model of investing in a batch of startups simultaneously, rather than one or two at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.
*   **Community and Peer Learning** The core insight was that entrepreneurship can be lonely, and being in a group allows founders to motivate each other and learn from their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>. YC runs on WhatsApp groups with over 4,000 companies and 8,500 alumni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>.
*   **Application and Interview Process** YC accepts applications from anyone, globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. The acceptance rate is still below three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. The infamous 10-minute interview often yields a decision in the first two minutes, with a "one yes is enough" model for acceptance, meaning only one group partner needs to give a strong yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.
*   **Evolution to Remote-First** Since the pandemic, all YC batches have been fully remote, removing the previous requirement for founders to come to Mountain View <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This has enabled 50% of batches to be international <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.
*   **Founder Focus** YC's strength lies in its ability to assess what makes a good founder, leveraging extensive data and pattern recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. They prioritize supporting "earnest founders" who are committed to building, regardless of the initial idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.
*   **Growth and Impact** YC has produced a total combined market capitalization of over $600 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>. Notable alumni include Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Brex, Modern Treasury, Vouch, and Vanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Early Funding** The initial check for the first YC batch was $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:45">[01:09:45]</a>, self-funded by the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>.

## The Continuity Fund

The Y Combinator Continuity Fund is considered the "graduate school" within the YC university model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>. It was launched in July 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a> to provide ongoing support and investment to YC alumni.

Key aspects of the Continuity Fund:
*   **Mission** Its goal is to be a lifelong partner for enduring companies, supporting them beyond the accelerator stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. YC's mission is to help more founders start and build enduring companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **Investment Stage** The fund primarily focuses on growth-stage investments, specifically Series B and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.
*   **Genesis** The fund was created in response to founders needing more capital for growth, as the median time to IPO in 2015 was 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>, and there were fewer than 10 funds capable of writing $100 million checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
*   **Leadership** The Continuity Fund is run by Anu Hariharan and Ali Rogani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Its investment committee consists of three people: Anu, Ali, and one early-stage partner for tie-breaking votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.
*   **Investment Activity** In its first seven years, the fund made 35 investments, representing less than one percent of YC companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>.
*   **Relationship with Founders** YC founders view YC as a "parent," not just an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. YC emphasizes "earning the right to win" when it comes to investments, respecting founders' decisions even if they choose other investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. The success of YC companies is prioritized over fund returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>.
*   **Post-Batch Programming** Continuity runs several programs to support founders post-accelerator:
    *   **Series A Program**: Helps founders prepare to raise Series A funding, including pitch decks, term sheet negotiation, and investor identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.
    *   **Post-A Program**: A six-week program that "re-batches" companies after they raise their Series A, where scaled founders teach on topics like recruiting and hiring engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
    *   **Growth Program**: Focuses on CEO scaling, covering hiring executives, performance management, and culture, with speakers like Tony Xu (DoorDash CEO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.
    *   **Pre-IPO Program**: A newer program requested by founders, where YC companies like Airbnb and Coinbase share their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>.
*   **Investment Philosophy** The fund invests based on "inputs" rather than just "outputs" or "trailing indicators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. They assess three key founder qualities at the growth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>:
    1.  **Speed of Movement**: How fast they ship and iterate, which correlates with success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.
    2.  **Hiring Ability**: Their effectiveness in hiring engineers and executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.
    3.  **Clarity of Thought**: Their ability to articulate a clear vision for building a multi-billion dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.
*   **Funding Structure** The Continuity Fund operates like other funds, with external Limited Partners (LPs), primarily university endowments, aligning with YC's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   **Global Reach** YC has investments in India, London, Latin America, and the Middle East, reflecting its mission to enable entrepreneurship globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

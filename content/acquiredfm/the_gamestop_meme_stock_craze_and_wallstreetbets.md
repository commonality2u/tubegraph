The [[The GameStop meme stock craze and WallStreetBets | GameStop meme stock craze]] was a significant focus area for a member of the House Financial Services Committee, alongside China-related capital markets and crypto [00:00:29]. The phenomenon, particularly as followed on WallStreetBets, was described as both "interesting and fun" [00:00:33].

## Legislative Outcomes and Hearings

Despite extensive work, including four congressional hearings on the [[The GameStop meme stock craze and WallStreetBets | meme stock]] mania, no substantial legislation emerged [00:00:46]. The Congressman expressed [[disappointment_in_legislative_outcomes_from_meme_stock_hearings | disappointment]] that the hearings did not lead to effective legislative changes [00:00:48].

One proposed bipartisan solution was to shorten the settlement time for trades from two days to one, which would have reduced systemic risk and potentially prevented situations like Robinhood halting trading [00:01:05]. However, instead of passing this targeted reform, other legislative items, unrelated to the core issues of the [[The GameStop meme stock craze and WallStreetBets | meme stock craze]], were bundled into a bill that passed the House but was not expected to advance in the Senate [00:01:18]. This outcome was viewed as a "political casualty" and a source of frustration due to the significant effort invested [00:01:37].

## Congressional Engagement with WallStreetBets

During the remote hearings on the [[The GameStop meme stock craze and WallStreetBets | meme stock]] phenomenon, members of Congress actively engaged with the public sentiment on WallStreetBets [00:01:59]. One Congressman used two computers during the hearing: one for the official proceedings and another to monitor the WallStreetBets forum in real-time [00:01:59]. The forum users would "absolutely eviscerate" members who spoke, even comparing one Congressman to "Hitman" â€“ a character from a video game and movie [00:02:11]. This real-time feedback from WallStreetBets provided an unconventional and engaging aspect to the congressional hearings [00:02:14].

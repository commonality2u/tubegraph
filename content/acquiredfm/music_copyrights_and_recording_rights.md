Copyright law's fundamental purpose is to spur innovation and creativity across all forms of intellectual property, including music, trademarks, and patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It is important to consider if these laws are being used as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:

## Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording/Master)
The sound recording copyright, also known as a master recording or master, protects the literal recording of the music as it was captured in the studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Traditionally, this copyright is owned by the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Labels assume ownership of these masters in exchange for taking on the financial risk associated with betting on, distributing, and promoting an artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This model is comparable to the old-school [[advances_and_recoupment_in_music_contracts | venture capital industry]] in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, where investors would take the majority of a company for providing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The market terms for such risks have changed significantly, but in the [[economic_split_between_artists_and_labels | music industry]], there are essentially only three major labels, and many aspiring artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)
The second type of copyright is the musical composition copyright, or publishing right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This copyright covers the written lyrics and the melodyâ€”essentially, the "idea" of the song that could be put down on sheet music, before it's actually played or recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Historically, these rights are held by the songwriters themselves, often through their [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | music publishers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Publishers typically handle these composition copyrights in a manner similar to how labels manage master recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Historical Role of Publishers**: [[changes_in_music_publishing_and_licensing_over_time | Music publishers]] used to be extremely powerful in the era before recorded music, when publishing rights (sheet music) were the primary rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. At that time, singers were often not the songwriters, making artists and [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record labels]] dependent on these publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Modern Role of Publishers**: Today, publishers have less relative power compared to [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | labels]] or major artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. They now take significantly less than the historical 50% of royalties from composition copyrights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For major songwriters, the arrangement might involve paying a fixed fee to the publisher for administrative services, effectively allowing the songwriter to own their own musical composition copyrights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Co-Writers**: Songwriting credits and associated splits can be privately negotiated among co-writers in any manner, such as 50/50, 90/10, or a flat fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For certain approvals requiring a publishing license, multiple co-writers may need to sign off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Interplay and Licensing
These two copyrights serve as the fundamental building blocks for all other uses of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
Some uses of music require approval for only one of these copyrights, while other uses require both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. For uses that require both, the owner of the sound recording master right and the owner of the publishing right both have a veto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The [[economic_split_between_artists_and_labels | splits and income]] generated can vary widely depending on the music's use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Economic Splits and Recoupment
Historically, the [[economic_split_between_artists_and_labels | economic split]] for songwriting royalties was better for artists than the splits with [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | labels]] on the master side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

When an artist signs a distribution deal where a [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] provides an [[advances_and_recoupment_in_music_contracts | upfront advance]] to make an album, the label then owns the master recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The artist's royalty stream, though independently negotiated, typically amounts to only 10-15%, possibly reaching 20-22% for very prominent artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The vast majority of these economics go to the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Recoupment
A key concept in these agreements is [[advances_and_recoupment_in_music_contracts | recoupment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Artists only begin to participate in revenues after the [[advances_and_recoupment_in_music_contracts | advance]] provided by the label has been recouped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For example, if a label gives an artist a $500,000 advance, the label will keep the first $500,000 generated from album sales or [[streaming_economics_and_its_impact_on_artists | streaming]] before the artist receives their 10-15% share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This system is likened to a VC preference stack on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

This [[advances_and_recoupment_in_music_contracts | Byzantine]] model stems from an era where it was very expensive to produce an album, distribute it, get radio play, and acquire fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The perceived "predatory" nature of these deals arises because most artists fail, and the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record labels]] (or [[advances_and_recoupment_in_music_contracts | VCs]]) sink money into ventures that might not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. An [[economic_split_between_artists_and_labels | economic split]] is necessary so that the successful artists can more than compensate for the losses from those who do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. However, this model is rapidly changing in the current landscape where artists can build audiences before significant upfront investment is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

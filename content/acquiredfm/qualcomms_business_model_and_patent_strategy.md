[[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]] is the company most responsible for the modern mobile communication system, described as a "layered series of magic tricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:19">[02:17:19]</a>. Its business model and patent strategy are considered among the most innovative and leveraged of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Evolution of the Business Model
Qualcomm's initial strategic approach was to operate as a consulting firm, following the model of its predecessor, Linkabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

### From Consulting to Solutions
Initially, Linkabit focused on NASA and Navy defense projects, primarily working on satellite communications where bandwidth was very narrow and efficiency was critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. They initially served as sub-consultants on these projects, but soon realized they could bid directly on contracts and make more money by offering product-focused services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. This led them to move into the commercial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.

Their first major commercial project was building the satellite communication system for [[Founding of Qualcomm and Linkabit | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. They then developed the video scrambling system for pay TV, which was adopted by HBO and other major pay TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

Qualcomm, founded in 1985, initially started by doing consulting work, similar to Linkabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>. They later merged with their customer, Omnet, in 1988, raising $3.5 million to fund the development of OmniTRACS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. This merger was a strategic move to provide a full-stack solution to customers who preferred not to operate their own dispatch and messaging centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. OmniTRACS generated $32 million in revenue in its first year (1989), a significant inflation-adjusted sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

### The Core Business Model: Chips and Licensing
By December 1999, [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]] had sold its infrastructure business to Ericson and its mobile phone business to Kyocera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>. This allowed [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm's business model]] to become focused on two main segments:
1.  **Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT)**: Selling high-margin semiconductor designs, primarily radio chips for encoding and decoding telephony signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>. They were the first to design their own chips without needing in-house foundries, thanks to the emergence of fabless semiconductors enabled by Morris Chang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>. Today, [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]] is the largest fabless semiconductor company globally by number of orders, larger than Nvidia or Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:29">[01:27:29]</a>.
2.  **Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)**: Earning very high-margin revenue from licensing its extensive patent portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>.

This dual model allowed [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]] to capture "all of the value" from both the IP and the semiconductor design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>. The licensing business provides predictable, high-margin revenue (69% margin) that funds R&D, which in turn fuels new products and more IP for the licensing flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:02">[02:20:02]</a>.

## Patent Strategy and Dominance
Qualcomm's success is heavily tied to its aggressive and visionary patent strategy, particularly around Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).

### The CDMA Breakthrough
In 1986, [[Founding of Qualcomm and Linkabit | Qualcomm]] patented the method and technique for CDMA applied to terrestrial cellular networks (US patent number 4,991,307) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>. This patent is considered one of the most valuable in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>.

CDMA was a revolutionary technology that allowed multiple conversations to access the same channels concurrently, maximally using the allocated spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. It offered significant advantages over Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), including:
*   **Efficiency**: CDMA was 3 to 5 times more efficient than TDMA, allowing carriers to fit more subscribers per unit of infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. This meant lower costs and higher potential monthly revenue for carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>.
*   **Voice Quality and Security**: Voice quality was significantly better, and security was enhanced, a benefit stemming from its military origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   **Power Management**: CDMA required less power on the endpoints, making it more suitable for mobile phones compared to earlier analog systems that needed car-sized power sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

At the time, many did not believe CDMA was technically feasible due to the sophisticated processing power required for real-time operation on both base stations and mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. However, [[Founding of Qualcomm and Linkabit | Qualcomm]] correctly foresaw the advancements in [[Qualcomms role in the development of mobile system on a chip | Moore's Law]] that would make it possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.

### Navigating the "Holy Wars of Wireless"
The US Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) released performance requirements for 2G networks in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. [[Founding of Qualcomm and Linkabit | Qualcomm]] realized that TDMA, the frontrunner standard in Europe, would not meet the US spec's capacity limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.

Crucially, unlike Europe, the US government's standard was not mandatory, allowing carriers to use any technology as long as it met the performance specification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>. [[Founding of Qualcomm and Linkabit | Qualcomm]] leveraged this by pitching CDMA directly to individual carriers in what became known as the "Holy Wars of Wireless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>. They were confident that the economic advantages of CDMA would prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.

After successful demonstrations in San Diego (1989) and New York City (1990) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>, [[Founding of Qualcomm and Linkabit | Qualcomm]] secured major US carriers like Pactel Wireless, Nynex Mobile, and Ameritech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>. They also expanded internationally, with South Korea famously mandating CDMA as its national standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. By 1993, US industry associations officially adopted CDMA as a second standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. CDMA achieved 57% market share in the US for 2G and massive market share in countries like South Korea and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>.

### IP Strategy: Patenting and Trade Secrets
[[Founding of Qualcomm and Linkabit | Qualcomm's]] IP strategy involves selectively patenting technologies while keeping others as trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. With over 17,000 patents, they ensure that key innovations are protected, compelling others to pay for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:02">[02:18:02]</a>. However, by not patenting everything, they maintain an advantage for consulting revenue and implementation fees, as direct collaboration with their engineers provides access to closely guarded trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:29">[02:18:29]</a>.

The rapid pace of wireless network generations (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G) works in [[Qualcomms role in the development of wireless technology standards | Qualcomm's]] favor. New generations emerge fast enough that core patents retain their value during their protection period, even as older patents become obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:01">[02:19:01]</a>.

### Litigation and Licensing Disputes
[[Challenges and legal disputes faced by Qualcomm | Qualcomm]] has faced numerous [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | lawsuits and regulatory challenges]] regarding its licensing practices. These include:
*   **Broadcom Lawsuit (2009)**: [[Challenges and legal disputes faced by Qualcomm | Qualcomm]] lost a lawsuit and had to pay $900 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:43">[01:45:43]</a>.
*   **International Disputes**: Licensing disputes with nations like China (2015), South Korea, the EU, and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:45">[01:46:45]</a>.
*   **Apple Lawsuit (2017)**: Apple and the US Federal Trade Commission sued [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]], alleging abuse of its market position as the dominant smartphone modem supplier to force excessive fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:42">[01:50:42]</a>.

Because [[Qualcomms role in the development of wireless technology standards | Qualcomm]] owns patents that are part of industry standards, it is required to charge "Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory" (FRAND) prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:21">[01:55:21]</a>. Apple argued that [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm's]] charges were highly unreasonable, including a requested $7.50 per phone sold, which could escalate to $17, plus baseband chip costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:20">[01:52:20]</a>.

Apple eventually settled with [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] in 2019, agreeing to continue using their radios and paying $4.5 billion for six years of patent licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:52">[01:59:52]</a>. This settlement occurred because Intel's modem business, Apple's alternative supplier, fell too far behind in 5G development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>.

## Strategic Moves for the Future
[[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]] is projecting its future growth beyond handsets into new areas:
*   **Nuvia Acquisition**: In 2021, [[Strategic business decisions and acquisitions by Qualcomm | Qualcomm]] acquired Nuvia for $1.4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:50">[02:01:50]</a>. Nuvia was founded by former Apple silicon architects, and this acquisition aims to allow [[Qualcomms role in the development of mobile system on a chip | Qualcomm]] to design custom ARM-based CPUs for its Snapdragon chips, potentially competing with Apple's M-series chips for laptops and desktops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:06">[02:02:06]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]] is highlighting IoT, automotive, and RF front-end (RFFE) as key growth areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:19">[02:04:19]</a>. These segments already contribute significantly to their chip revenue, with automotive at $2 billion and RFFE at $4 billion annually, and IoT exceeding $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:07">[02:16:07]</a>. [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]] views the "intelligent connected edge" as a $700 billion opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:43">[02:16:43]</a>.

Despite a history of failing when straying too far from their core competency in phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>, [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]] believes these new areas will drive future success, especially as the handset market matures and competitors like Apple develop in-house modem solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:25">[02:01:25]</a>.

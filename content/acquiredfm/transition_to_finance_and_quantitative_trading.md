Jeff Bezos's early career laid the foundation for his future endeavors, beginning outside traditional finance before a pivotal [[transitioning_from_media_to_investment | transition into quantitative trading]] and investment.

## Early Career and Tech Foundations

After graduating college in 1986, Jeff Bezos did not immediately enter finance. Instead, he worked for a startup called Phytel, founded by Columbia computer science professors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This company was developing early network technology for high-speed trading applications, which served as a precursor to today's co-located data centers for exchanges like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Bezos spent two years at Phytel, gaining valuable experience in early networked computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This period provided him with not only a basic understanding of how the technology worked but also insights into the practical implications of data flow, packet counts, and hardware bandwidth in financial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He observed that the customers utilizing this infrastructure for [[evolution_of_markets_and_investment_strategies | quantitative trading]] and finance were making significantly more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Entry into Finance and Banking

In 1988, Bezos decided to join the financial sector, moving to Bankers Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Given his technical background and computer science degree, it is likely he was involved in [[evolution_of_markets_and_investment_strategies | quantitative trading]] and finance roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Bankers Trust later became part of Deutsche Bank through a series of mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

During this period, Bezos also pursued an entrepreneurial side project with Halsey Minor, attempting to start a financial newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Although this venture didn't materialize, Minor went on to found CNET shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Both Bezos and Minor recognized the potential of distributing written content over the burgeoning World Wide Web, albeit with Bezos initially choosing to ship physical books rather than hypertext <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Joining D. E. Shaw & Co.

In 1990, a headhunter convinced Jeff Bezos to interview at D. E. Shaw & Co., a financial firm founded a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Bezos "fell in love" with the firm and its philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### The Vision of David E. Shaw

The founder, David E. Shaw, held a Stanford computer science PhD from the 1980s and was a former computer science professor at Columbia University, potentially collaborating with the professors who founded Phytel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Shaw, deeply interested in finance due to his step-father being a finance professor at UCLA, left Columbia in 1986 to join Morgan Stanley before starting D. E. Shaw in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

His model for D. E. Shaw was inspired by Jim Simons, who started Renaissance Technologies (RenTec) in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. RenTec's Medallion Fund, consisting solely of private capital from employees, achieved an astonishing average annual return of 66.1% from 1988 to 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

While D. E. Shaw operated as a [[evolution_of_markets_and_investment_strategies | quant hedge fund]], they resisted being solely defined by this. They saw themselves as a group of "creative artisans" who invested in and started businesses, bringing diverse perspectives to problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Bezos's Ascent and Key Contributions

Bezos rapidly ascended the ranks at D. E. Shaw, becoming the fourth senior vice president—the highest level below David Shaw—at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. He became a rising star and developed a close mentorship with David Shaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Bezos was heavily involved in recruiting, helping to bring in highly intelligent individuals from various disciplines, regardless of their financial background. This philosophy, similar to Bridgewater Associates today, focused on finding the smartest people and then assigning them roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Notable recruits who later joined Amazon included Jeff Holden, Nicholas Lovejoy, and Mackenzie Scott Tuttle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Jeff and Mackenzie would later marry, and Mackenzie is often considered the first Amazon employee, handling early accounting and legal operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Within D. E. Shaw's entrepreneurial environment, Bezos led several projects:
*   **Third Market Business:** His first project involved building a separate market where retail investors could trade off-exchange, reducing commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This concept predates modern dark pools and the payment for order flow models used by firms like Robinhood and Citadel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Internet Opportunities:** Recognizing the nascent but growing internet (Mosaic, Netscape days, 1992-1993), David Shaw reassigned Bezos to explore new internet-based business plans for D. E. Shaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Bezos had personal experience with the early command-prompt internet from his college years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. One of the first ideas they pursued was an online retail brokerage for financial trading, similar to E-Trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This likely evolved from his work on the third market business, as online platforms made such services more viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

[[metas_approach_to_technology_and_innovation | Meta]] views itself as a "social connection company" focused on building the future of human connection, rather than just a social media or app company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. This core identity drives its strategy to build and own underlying technology platforms, ensuring it can create ideal social experiences without being constrained by others' platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

## Reasons for Platform Ownership

[[mark_zuckerbergs_vision_for_the_future_of_meta | Mark Zuckerberg's vision]] emphasizes the need to build "ideal experiences" rather than only what is "allowed to build on some platform that someone else built" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. This ambition extends to:

*   **Next-Generation Computing Platforms**: [[metas_approach_to_technology_and_innovation | Meta]] aims to build future computing platforms, such as glasses capable of projecting holograms and acting as AI assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. This is seen as a natural continuation of their goal to enhance human connection, moving beyond small phone screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. The development of advanced hardware like holographic displays and miniaturized components is a significant, decade-long project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Controlling Destiny**: Owning the platform allows [[metas_approach_to_technology_and_innovation | Meta]] to control its own destiny, avoiding dependence on others who might restrict product development or revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:04">[01:55:04]</a>.
*   **Financial Benefits**: There's a calculated financial benefit to owning platforms. [[mark_zuckerbergs_vision_for_the_future_of_meta | Zuckerberg]] estimates that [[metas_approach_to_technology_and_innovation | Meta]] "might be like twice as profitable if we own the platform" due to avoiding various "taxes" and restrictions imposed by existing platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:08">[01:55:08]</a>.

> "The thing is I I I never thought about us as a social media company right we're not a social app company we are a a social connection company right I mean I I we talk about what we're doing as building the future of human connection." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>

## Lessons from the Past: The HTML5 Mobile Experience

A pivotal lesson came from [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook's]] early mobile strategy. Leading up to its IPO in 2012, [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook's]] mobile presence relied on HTML5, aiming for continuous deployment across various phone types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:19">[01:31:19]</a>. However, this proved to be a "wrong" decision as native integration was "critical for having the interactions feel good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>.

This led to a painful period where the company had to rewrite its apps from scratch, pausing new feature development for about a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>. During this time, mobile traffic grew dramatically, while the company had no revenue from mobile, as the desktop ad column couldn't translate directly to mobile feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. This "painful" experience underscored the importance of technical foundations and the ability to control the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:03">[01:41:03]</a>.

## Investing in Core Technologies

[[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta's strategies]] involve significant investments in core technologies:

*   **[[metaverse_and_its_implications_for_companies_like_meta | Reality Labs]]**: Starting in 2014, [[metas_approach_to_technology_and_innovation | Meta]] doubled down on [[metaverse_and_its_implications_for_companies_like_meta | Reality Labs]] to build out AR/VR technologies, despite knowing investors might "hate it" in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. The goal is to build "awesome" and "uplifting" products, moving beyond merely "good" ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:52">[02:08:52]</a>.
*   **AI Infrastructure**: Similarly, [[metas_approach_to_technology_and_innovation | Meta]] is scaling up its AI infrastructure, building its own leading AI models like Llama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:49">[03:48:49]</a>. This ensures access to cutting-edge AI and prevents dependency on external providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **[[the_future_of_technology_platforms_and_open_source | Open Source]]**: [[metas_approach_to_technology_and_innovation | Meta]] has a significant relationship with [[the_future_of_technology_platforms_and_open_source | open source]] technology, being one of the first major companies built on the LAMP stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:52">[03:31:52]</a>. They also open-sourced their distributed computing infrastructure (Open Compute) when it was not a competitive advantage against companies like Google, leading to industry standardization and significant cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:06">[03:45:06]</a>. This approach extends to AI with Llama, aiming for an ecosystem that benefits from community building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## The Ideological Battle for Future Platforms

[[mark_zuckerbergs_vision_for_the_future_of_meta | Zuckerberg]] sees a coming "ideological battle" over the architecture of the next generation of platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. This involves a choice between:

*   **Closed, Integrated Models**: Like Apple's approach, which is currently dominant in mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   **Open Platforms**: Like Windows in the PC era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. [[metas_approach_to_technology_and_innovation | Meta]] aims to build and ensure the success of the next generation of [[the_future_of_technology_platforms_and_open_source | open platforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. This vision is driven by the belief that [[the_future_of_technology_platforms_and_open_source | open platforms]] foster a more vibrant tech industry, allowing individual developers to build without seeking permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. Apple is considered a primary competitor in this ideological battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

## [[mark_zuckerbergs_vision_for_the_future_of_meta | Mark Zuckerberg's Vision]] and Control

[[mark_zuckerbergs_vision_for_the_future_of_meta | Mark Zuckerberg's vision]] and desire for control have been central to [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta's strategies]]. His acquisition of super-voting shares after the Yahoo acquisition attempt in 2006, where the board tried to fire him for not wanting to sell the company, solidified his long-term control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:27">[01:49:27]</a>. This control has allowed him to pursue ambitious, long-term investments like [[metaverse_and_its_implications_for_companies_like_meta | Reality Labs]], even when they are not immediately profitable or popular with investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:51">[01:55:51]</a>.

[[mark_zuckerbergs_vision_for_the_future_of_meta | Zuckerberg]] acknowledges the challenges of being a startup, preferring to be a "going concern" as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:38">[01:51:38]</a>. This reflects a desire to operate with sufficient resources and stability to pursue long-term, impactful projects. The company's rebranding from [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook]] to [[metas_approach_to_technology_and_innovation | Meta]] was a deliberate move to embrace a future-oriented brand that embodies the vision of building the [[metaverse_and_its_implications_for_companies_like_meta | metaverse]], rather than running away from past [[the_impact_of_political_challenges_on_meta | political challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>.

> "We run towards something we don't run away from things and when we got to [[metas_approach_to_technology_and_innovation | Meta]] then I was like all right we're here and it was around the time time when we were doubling down on the investment and where there was all the controversy and it's like look like if we're doing this we're going to lean into this and we're going to do it so let's do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>

This proactive approach to platform ownership and technological investment is central to [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta's strategies]] to remain a leading force in human connection for decades to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>.

The concept of equal partnership in [[Venture Capital Partnership Dynamics | venture capital partnership dynamics]] emerged as a significant shift in the mid-1990s, particularly influencing the formation of [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark Capital]]. It challenged the traditional models where senior partners retained a disproportionate share of firm economics.

## Origins of the Movement

A 1995 *New York Times* article shed light on the internal politics of Silicon Valley [[Venture Capital Models and Partnerships | venture farms]], quoting an anonymous source who stated that if Merrill Pickard had "divided the rewards more equitably, they wouldn't have split up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This sentiment reflected a growing resentment among younger partners in established firms against the "privilege" of the older generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

A key figure advocating for this change was Bob Cagle, then a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI). Cagle, who came from a humble background in Flint, Michigan, and was the first in his family to attend college (General Motors University, followed by Stanford Business School), expressed a strong belief in a more distributed power structure within venture firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. He held an "almost religious fervor" that "anything other than an equal partnership was just like morally wrong for a [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital]] firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

### Core Principles Proposed by Bob Cagle

Cagle's vision for equal partnership, later embodied by [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark]], encompassed several key aspects:
*   **Equal Carry**: Each partner in a given fund would receive equal carry (share of profits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **Management Company Ownership**: All current General Partners (GPs) would own the management company without having to purchase it, as it would be "just given to whoever the equal current GPs are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This was in contrast to established firms like Kleiner Perkins, where ownership transitioned (e.g., from Kleiner and Perkins to [[Venture capital industry dynamics | John Doerr]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: This philosophy was driven by a deep "sense of fairness," a belief in "morally what is the right thing to do," and the principle of "proper rewards for proper work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Economic motivations also played a role, as Cagle felt that while he was doing the work, senior partners were "making the money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Firm Dissolution

Despite Cagle's strong conviction, discussions at TVI regarding an equal partnership model did not reach a resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Ultimately, the senior partners at TVI decided to "declare victory" and dissolve the firm, particularly after the success of their Microsoft investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This dissolution, though presented as a triumph, was partly a consequence of the internal disagreement over economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Former TVI partner Dave Marquardt went on to found August Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. Marquardt's investment style at TVI, emphasizing an "intensely personal relationship business" that doesn't scale well and empowering founders, reflected principles later adopted by [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

Similarly, at Merrill Pickard, Bruce Dunleavy and Andy Ratcliffe, two young partners, also agitated for an equal economics idea during internal discussions about their next fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. These conversations mirrored the outcome at TVI, with their proposals likely receiving "little pats on the head" rather than serious consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

## Formation of Benchmark Capital

Bob Cagle's deep-seated belief in equal partnership led him to seek to establish a new firm based on this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. In early 1994, he approached Bruce Dunleavy, his former intern at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and a rising "Young Turk" at Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Cagle's offer for Dunleavy to be his equal partner was "counter to human nature" and demonstrated Cagle's "obsessive sense of fairness" and "absurd amount of self-confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

Initially, Dunleavy declined due to financial security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. However, after Merrill Pickard's internal discussions proved fruitless, Dunleavy, along with Andy Ratcliffe, joined Cagle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.

Recognizing the need for more investment capacity and diversification, Bruce suggested bringing in "entrepreneurial DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. They recruited Kevin Harvey, a former entrepreneur who had founded two companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. A fifth founding member, Val Vaden, who had experience in software company buyouts, was also brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>.

The founders, Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, Kevin Harvey, and Val Vaden, named their new firm [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark Capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. This "audacious" name signaled their aspiration "to set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry and how [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital]] is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. Their commitment to equal partnership and a different model of [[Entrepreneur and Venture Capitalist Relationship | venture capital]] investing, despite being seen as "nuts" by many established GPs in the valley, became their defining characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>.

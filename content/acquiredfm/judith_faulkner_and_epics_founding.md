Epic Systems, a quiet company based in rural Wisconsin, plays an enormous role in the lives of many, primarily through its medical patient software, MyChart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Founded by Judith Faulkner, Epic is an unusual company that does no marketing, little sales, often declines potential customers, and does not negotiate or discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It has never raised venture capital or made any acquisitions in its 47 years of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The company operates entirely in-person from a gigantic campus in Verona, Wisconsin, designed with whimsical themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Judith Faulkner's Early Life and Education

Judith "Judy" Faulkner (n√©e Greenfield) was born in Earlton, New Jersey, in August 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Her father, Lou, was a small-town entrepreneur who ran a local pharmacy and soda fountain called "LSE Lou Soda Fountain," which may have influenced Judy's entrepreneurial spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Her mother, Dell Greenfield, was highly active in peace advocacy, eventually becoming the executive director of Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility, a group that shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Judy's early interest lay in math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. After graduating high school in 1961, she majored in math at Dickinson College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. During a summer job at the University of Rochester's particle physics lab, she taught herself Fortran in a week and became one of the lab's best programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. She fell in love with programming, seeing it as a combination of math, language, and art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

When applying to PhD programs in math, Stanford and the University of Wisconsin, which were just starting their computer science departments, unilaterally shifted her applications to their new CS schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Judy chose Wisconsin, starting her PhD in computer science, though she never finished it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## The Genesis of Epic Systems

At the University of Wisconsin, Judy took a class called "Computers in Medicine," taught by Dr. Warner Slack from the Wisconsin Medical School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. As a top student, Dr. Slack asked her to write programs to optimize hospital operations, such as doctor on-call schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Working as a part-time grad student for $5 an hour, her efficiency often meant she didn't earn much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Through working with various hospital departments, Judy identified a critical need: a single, integrated database to keep longitudinal records of patients across all departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This concept of an electronic health record (EHR) was the origin of Epic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

### The Problem of Medical Records

In the mid-1960s, American patient health records were largely paper-based, informal, and lacked standardization, despite attempts dating back to 1912 at Mass General Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The inability to easily share information between doctors and departments within a hospital, let alone between different hospitals, was a major challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Doctors, being independent-minded, resisted standardized note-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

Two key developments in the mid-1960s changed this:
1.  **Arrival of Computers**: Digitization offered the possibility of portability and standardization for health records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
2.  **Creation of Medicare and Medicaid (1965)**: These government programs created a need for documentation to get paid by third-party payers (insurance companies and government) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This mandated strict, codified, and regulated documentation and workflow for hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

The first computerized medical record system, Co-Star, was developed at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. Its programmers developed their own language, MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System), due to the high concurrency and transaction needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. MUMPS integrated the language and database, making it efficient for handling high-volume data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Neil Papalardo, the lead programmer of Co-Star, later spun out his work into a company called Metatech, which remains a key competitor to Epic today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

### The "Chronicles" Epiphany

Judy learned about MUMPS through her continued connection with Dr. Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Legend has it that in the mid-1970s, she had an epiphany in her living room about how to build a single, integrated database for patient records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. She immediately began writing code that would become "Chronicles," named to reflect a patient's care journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. This core database, with its unified architecture, remains at the heart of Epic's systems today, differentiating it from competitors who often use multiple, glued-together systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.

Initially, Chronicles was just a database for the University of Wisconsin Medical Center, accessed via text-only terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. However, as UW doctors spoke about Chronicles at conferences, demand spread virally, with other health systems requesting similar software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

## Founding Human Services Computing

Despite initial reluctance, Judy finally agreed to start a company part-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. In 1979, "Human Services Computing" was born, the future Epic Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.

To fund the company, Judy secured a $70,000 bank loan to purchase a Data General Eclipse mini-computer (the size of a washer/dryer system) and raised another $70,000 from friends, family, and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. This initial $140,000 was the only primary investment Epic Systems ever received, a stark contrast to other tech giants like [[Microsoft Early History|Microsoft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

The company's first office was in the basement of an apartment building at 2020 University Avenue in Madison, Wisconsin, a space it shared with another notable Madison startup, the American Girl Doll Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.

## Shaping Early Strategy and Culture

Judy, a software developer by trade, initially knew little about running a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. Dr. Slack connected her with Neil Papalardo of Metatech, who spent three days giving Judy a crash course in setting up and running a software company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. Papalardo, also a programmer, ran Metatech with highly standardized processes, manuals for HR, benefits, payroll, college hiring, and internal promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. Judy adopted this playbook, which heavily influenced Epic's unique culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

Epic's hiring strategy, inspired by Metatech, focused on recruiting fresh college graduates, often from Midwestern schools, with technical majors, operating on the assumption they could learn healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. This was unusual for the era, preceding even [[Microsoft Early History|Microsoft's]] large-scale college recruiting efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. Judy's teenage son even developed one of Epic's initial programming tests for hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>.

### Renaming and Early Growth

In 1983, Human Services Computing was renamed Epic Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. The new name, inspired by the Greek concept of a "big story" or "longitudinal historic event," reflected Judy's view of a patient's life as an epic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

Growth was slow initially; by the end of 1988, Epic had only 24 customers and $1.5 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. A key reason was their focus on only clinical medical records, not the crucial billing component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. This changed in 1987 with the launch of "Resolute," a billing module built atop the Chronicles database, which became central to the company's revenue cycle operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. The integrated nature of Epic's single-database system (connecting clinical and billing) became a major competitive advantage, especially compared to competitors often built through mergers and acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

### Expansion in the PC Era and Consumer Access

With the advent of the PC era in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Epic's market expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. In 1992, Epic launched "Epicare," reportedly the industry's first graphical user interface (Windows-based) EMR application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>. This made the system accessible to average doctors and nurses, directly linking clinical interactions to billing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>. This product, combined with their scheduling system "Cadence," was trajectory-changing, driving revenue to $18 million by 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.

In 2000, Epic made a pioneering move by launching MyChart, an internet-based, consumer-facing platform for medical records access and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. This was considered groundbreaking for its time, especially in a highly regulated industry like healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. MyChart allowed patients to access their records, message doctors, schedule appointments, and manage family members' care, becoming a massive success with 191 million active users today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>.

The launch of Epicare's inpatient version in 2001 completed the "holy grail" for hospitals, providing a fully integrated system for both outpatient and inpatient care, tied directly to billing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

## Transformational Growth and Core Principles

By 2001, Epic's revenue crossed $50 million with 88 health systems as customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. A defining moment came in 2003 when Kaiser Permanente, the largest single hospital system in the US, selected Epic for a system-wide EMR, a deal worth an estimated $400 million to Epic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. Epic won this despite being a much smaller company than its rival, [[Epics competitive edge and business model|Cerner]], and notably refused Kaiser's request for an equity stake in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>. This demonstrated Epic's unwavering commitment to its long-term strategy of remaining private and avoiding outside investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:46">[02:47:46]</a>.

The failure of an earlier partnership with Philips, where Epic built a radiology-focused product that Philips would brand and distribute, led to "intense scar tissue" within Epic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>. This experience reinforced Judy's philosophy of building everything in-house and focusing on direct customer relationships, avoiding external dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>.

### The Verona Campus and Epic Culture

As Epic grew, a significant investment was made in its physical infrastructure. Inspired by [[Nvidias early history and founding|Microsoft's]] Redmond campus (after Judy toured it with her son, a Microsoft developer), Epic purchased 1,000 acres of farmland in Verona, Wisconsin, to build its corporate campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>. Unlike Microsoft's utilitarian design, Epic's campus injected a whimsical, fairy-tale theme, incorporating elements like the Land of Oz, a Wizards Academy, and a replica of New York's Grand Central Station, alongside an 11,000-seat underground auditorium called Deep Space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This unique environment serves to attract and retain smart, young college graduates, creating a cohesive, almost cult-like culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:36">[01:37:36]</a>.

Epic's culture is guided by "Ten Commandments" posted throughout the campus, which include: "Do not go public," "Do not acquire or be acquired," "Software must work," "Reality equals expectations," and "Be frugal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>. These reflect Judy's view of Epic as a "software factory" ‚Äì a highly efficient organization that turns developers into medical code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

Key aspects of Epic's internal culture include:
*   **Customer Obsession**: Everything at Epic revolves around its customers (hospital CEOs, CIOs, CFOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:24">[01:52:24]</a>. They have dedicated "Best Friends Forever" (BFFs) for each customer and even provide annual report cards benchmarking their performance against peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>.
*   **Rigorous Processes**: New hires undergo intensive training, and software development follows a prescriptive methodology to minimize bugs, ensuring high reliability where "every developer must fix their own bugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:43">[01:45:43]</a>.
*   **Immersion Trips**: All employees, including software developers, are required to spend time in clinical settings to directly observe workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>.
*   **Flat Organization**: With high trust and standardized methods, Epic operates with few middle managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:13">[01:44:13]</a>.

## The Impact of the High-Tech Act

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which included the HITECH Act (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act), profoundly impacted the healthcare IT industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:50">[02:14:50]</a>. This legislation provided $27 billion in direct incentives to hospitals for implementing EHRs, with additional funds for related IT projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:09">[02:15:09]</a>. It also introduced the concept of "meaningful use," incentivizing actual software usage and penalizing non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a>.

The HITECH Act caused market penetration of EHRs to skyrocket from 9% of hospitals in 2009 to 95% by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:24">[02:19:24]</a>. While the legislation aimed to reduce costs and promote interoperability, its effects were mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:18">[02:20:18]</a>. Critics argue it increased administrative burden for doctors and may have contributed to increased billing codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:25">[02:24:25]</a>. However, it undeniably accelerated digitization and entrenched existing EHR vendors, particularly Epic, due to its reliability and integrated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:02">[02:29:02]</a>.

## Dominance and Future Prospects

Epic continued its growth, hitting $1 billion in revenue in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:31">[02:34:31]</a>. It consistently won major contracts with top academic hospitals like Johns Hopkins and Mayo Clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:38">[02:34:38]</a>. The fact that 90% of medical school students now train on Epic further solidified its market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:27">[02:46:27]</a>. The consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, driven by increased compliance burdens and the Affordable Care Act, has also benefited Epic, as larger hospital systems seek comprehensive, reliable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:55">[02:50:55]</a>.

Today, Epic serves 607 customers (representing 3,200 hospitals) and 325 million patients worldwide, with 280 million in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:36">[03:00:36]</a>. In 2024, its revenue was $5.7 billion, growing 16% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:14">[03:01:14]</a>. With 14,000 employees and estimated EBITDA margins between 30-35%, Epic remains a highly profitable and influential company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:19">[03:05:19]</a>.

Epic's "Care Everywhere" system, which allows seamless sharing of 20 million patient records daily between Epic customers, showcases its commitment to interoperability within its ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>. The company also developed Cosmos, a database containing anonymized data from 295 million patients and 15 billion encounters, accessible for free to contributing institutions for research and clinical insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>. This vast dataset holds immense potential, especially with the rise of AI, for improving patient care and driving future innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:53">[02:58:53]</a>.

Judy Faulkner, at 81, has put a succession plan in place through a "purpose trust" that will hold her 100% voting control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:51">[03:09:51]</a>. The trust bylaws stipulate that Epic can never be sold or taken public, and future CEOs must be long-time employees and software developers, ensuring the company's unique culture and strategy endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:29">[03:10:29]</a>. This dedication to founder continuity and a singular vision highlights Judy Faulkner's status as one of history's most successful entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

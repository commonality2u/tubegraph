Understanding how [[changes_in_the_music_industry_business_model | music licensing]] works is crucial to comprehending the [[artists_rights_and_music_ownership | music industry's business model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. At its core, [[importance_of_copyright_in_music_licensing | copyright law]] aims to stimulate innovation and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This principle applies across various forms of intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, and patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Two Core Copyrights in Music

When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:

### 1. Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording)

The first is the **sound recording copyright**, also known as a master recording or "master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
This copyright specifically covers the literal recording of the music as it was produced in the studio and can be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

*   **Traditional Ownership**: Traditionally, the master recording copyright is owned by the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Labels take ownership in exchange for assuming the financial risk involved in betting on, distributing, and promoting an artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This model can be compared to the old-school venture capital industry of the 1970s-90s, where investors would take a majority stake in a company for providing the initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Market Dynamics**: The [[the_evolution_of_record_deals_in_the_music_industry | music industry market]] is driven by supply and demand, with terms agreed upon to manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, the market terms have evolved, similar to how the venture capital industry's appetite for capital has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. In the music industry, there are essentially only three major labels, while many individuals aspire to be stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### 2. Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)

The second copyright is the **musical composition copyright**, also known as the publishing right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This covers the written lyrics and the melody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It represents the "idea" of the song, something that could be put down on sheet music, before any notes are actually played or recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The master recording, conversely, is the execution â€“ the notes played and recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

*   **Traditional Ownership**: These rights are traditionally held by the songwriters themselves, often managed through their music publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Role of Music Publishers**: Music publishers manage these composition copyrights similarly to how labels manage master recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Historically, publishers took 50% of the royalties generated from the composition copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Today, their share is significantly less; larger songwriters might pay a fixed fee to a publisher for back-office services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. For practical purposes, songwriters generally own their own musical composition copyrights and can decide to license them for specific uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Historical Power**: Publishers were incredibly powerful before the era of recorded music when publishing rights (sheet music rights) were paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. As singers were often distinct from songwriters, artists and record labels were at the mercy of these publishers who owned the sheet music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Co-Writer Negotiations**: Songwriting credits and associated splits can be privately negotiated among co-writers, with various arrangements like 50/50, 90/10, or a flat fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. For certain approvals requiring the publishing license, multiple co-writers may need to sign off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Interplay and Licensing

These two copyrights are the fundamental building blocks for all other uses of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Some uses of music require approval from only one of these copyrights, while others require both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Both the owner of the sound recording master right and the owner of the publishing right generally have a veto over who can use the final product for use cases that require both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The [[economic_splits_and_recoupment_in_music_deals | income splits]] and generation vary significantly depending on the specific use of the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Economic Splits and Recoupment in Record Deals

Comparing the [[economic_splits_and_recoupment_in_music_deals | economic splits]] between publishers and record labels, the publishing side (where writers might keep 50% historically) was often more favorable to the artist than master-side deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

*   **Royalty Streams**: When an artist signs a distribution deal where a record label fronts money for an album, the label typically owns the master recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The artist's royalty stream, though independently negotiated, might only be around 10-15%, possibly up to 20-22% for very big artists, with the vast majority of economics going to the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Recoupment**: A critical concept is **recoupment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Artists only begin to participate in revenues *after* they have recouped the advance provided by the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For example, if a label gives an artist a $500,000 advance, the label keeps the first $500,000 generated from album sales or [[evolution_of_spotify_and_its_impact_on_the_music_industry | Spotify streams]] before the artist receives their 10-15% share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This is analogous to a VC preference stack on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Historical Justification for the Model

This "Byzantine" model, from a different era, stemmed from the high costs associated with making an album, promoting it on radio, and distributing it to acquire fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Most artists (or "startups") are expected to fail, meaning record labels (or VCs) sink money into projects that may not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The economic split ensures that the success of a few winners can compensate for the losses from the many who fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This model was justified in an "old world" where significant investment was required before an artist's audience could be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence, defining the roles and relationships between artists, record labels, and music publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Understanding these dynamics is crucial to comprehending [[the business and rights dynamics in the music industry | the business and rights dynamics in the music industry]] and how music is licensed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The fundamental purpose of copyright law is to stimulate innovation and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Two Primary Copyrights

There are two main types of [[sound recording and musical composition copyrights | copyrights]] involved in a musical work:

### 1. Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording/Master)
This copyright pertains to the literal recorded sound of the music, exactly as it was performed and captured, for instance, in a studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

*   **Ownership:** Traditionally owned by the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Label's Role:** Labels historically take ownership of these masters in exchange for assuming the financial risk involved in distributing and promoting an artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Economic Splits:** When an artist signs a distribution deal where a record label provides an upfront advance, the label typically owns the master recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The artist's royalty stream is independently negotiated, but they generally receive a small percentage, often 10-15%, possibly up to 20-22% for major artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The vast majority of these [[economic splits and recoupment in music deals | economics]] go to the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Recoupment:** Artists only begin to participate in these revenues after the initial advance they received from the label has been "recouped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For example, if a label gives an artist a $500,000 advance, the label will keep the first $500,000 generated from streams or sales before the artist receives their royalty percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This is analogous to a VC preference stack on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Market Dynamics:** The record label model, with its significant upfront investment in album production, radio promotion, and distribution, reflects an older era where such costs were substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This structure also accounts for the high failure rate of new artists, where the success of a few acts must compensate for the many who do not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The market for risk has changed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Historically, there were essentially only three major labels, creating an imbalance with many aspiring artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### 2. Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)
This copyright covers the underlying musical work, including the written lyrics and melody. It represents the "idea" of the song, something that could be put down on sheet music, even before it's performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

*   **Ownership:** Traditionally held by the songwriters themselves, often through their music publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Publisher's Role:** Publishers manage these composition copyrights similarly to how labels manage masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Economic Splits:** Historically, publishers would take 50% of the royalties generated from composition copyrights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Today, they often take much less, sometimes just a fixed fee from bigger songwriters for administrative services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Effectively, songwriters largely retain ownership of their composition copyrights and the decision-making power over their licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Historical Power:** Publishers were once incredibly powerful in the era before recorded music, when publishing rights (like sheet music sales) were the primary source of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. At that time, singers were often distinct from songwriters, leaving artists and record labels at the mercy of publishers who owned the sheet music rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Licensing and Veto Rights

These two copyrights form the foundational "building blocks" for all other uses of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

*   Some uses of music may require approval from only one of these copyright holders, while others necessitate approval from both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   For cases requiring both, whoever owns the [[music_licensing_overview | sound recording master right]] and whoever owns the [[music_licensing_overview | publishing right]] each possess a veto right over the final product's usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   The [[sponsorships_and_revenue_models_in_media | income splits]] generated from music usage vary wildly depending on the specific application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Co-Writer Dynamics
Songwriting credits and the associated [[economic splits and recoupment in music deals | economic splits]] can be privately negotiated among songwriters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This means that for approvals requiring a publishing license, multiple co-writers might need to sign off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The financial arrangements can vary greatly, from 50/50 splits to 90/10, or even flat fees, depending on the individuals involved and their relative contributions or fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. For example, a major artist like Taylor Swift might pay a lesser-known guest co-writer a flat fee or a small royalty percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The landscape of music licensing and [[music_copyrights_and_recording_rights | music copyrights and recording rights]] is built upon two fundamental types of copyrights that come into existence when a piece of music is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Understanding these two copyrights is crucial for comprehending the roles of record labels and music publishers.

## The Purpose of Copyright Law
The primary purpose of copyright law, across all intellectual property, is to spur innovation and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Two Types of Music Copyrights

When a song is created, two distinct copyrights are established:

### 1. Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording/Master)

This copyright pertains to the literal recording of the music as performed in a studio, which can be heard by ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

*   **Ownership**: Traditionally, the sound recording copyright (also known as a master recording or master) is owned by the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Role of Record Labels**: Labels historically take ownership of these masters in exchange for assuming the significant financial risk involved in betting on, distributing, and promoting an artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This model is likened to the old-school venture capital industry, where investors would take a majority stake in a company for providing initial funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Market Dynamics**: The music industry is largely dominated by about three major labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This market structure, coupled with high demand from aspiring artists, has historically influenced the terms of agreements.

### 2. Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)

This copyright covers the underlying written lyrics and melody of a song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It represents the "idea of the song" that could be put down on sheet music, distinct from its recorded performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

*   **Ownership**: These rights are traditionally held by the songwriters themselves, often managed through their music publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Role of Music Publishers**: Publishers historically dealt with composition copyrights much like labels dealt with masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   **Historical Power**: Publishers used to be "insanely powerful" in the era before recorded music, when publishing rights (sheet music) were the major rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Since singers were often not the songwriters, artists and record labels were at the mercy of publishers who owned the sheet music rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   **Modern Role**: While publishers historically took 50% of royalties from composition copyrights, today they take significantly less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For major songwriters, publishers might be paid a fixed fee for back-office tasks, effectively meaning the songwriter largely owns their own composition copyrights and can decide on licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Co-Writers**: Songwriting credits and associated splits can be privately negotiated among co-writers, ranging from 50/50 to flat fees or varied royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For certain uses requiring publishing licenses, multiple co-writers may need to sign off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Licensing and Veto Rights
These two copyrights form the "big building blocks" for all other music uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

*   Some uses of music require approval for only one type of copyright, while other use cases require both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Whoever owns the sound recording (master) right and whoever owns the publishing right both generally have a veto right on who can use the final product for use cases that require both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   The splits and income generated from various music uses can differ wildly depending on the specific application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## [[economic_split_between_artists_and_labels | Economic Split Between Artists and Labels]] and [[advances_and_recoupment_in_music_contracts | Advances and Recoupment in Music Contracts]]

Historically, the [[economic_split_between_artists_and_labels | economic split between artists and labels]] has been significantly skewed.

*   **Publishing Royalties**: In the past, publishers would keep about 50% of songwriting economics, with writers keeping the other 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Master Royalties**: In contrast, when an artist signs a distribution deal where a record label fronts money to make an album and subsequently owns the master, the artist's royalty stream is much lower. It's typically around 10-15%, with very big artists perhaps reaching 20-22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The vast majority of economics go to the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Recoupment**: Artists only participate in these revenues after they have "recouped" any upfront advances provided by the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   For example, if a label provides a $500,000 advance, the label will keep the first $500,000 generated from streams or sales before the artist begins to receive their 10-15% share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
    *   This system is compared to a venture capital preference stack on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Historical Rationale**: This "Byzantine" system stems from an era where making an album and achieving distribution and fan acquisition (customer acquisition) required substantial investment from labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Given that most artists (like startups) fail, labels needed an economic split where the success of winning artists could more than compensate for the losses from those who didn't succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This old-world model, where significant upfront investment was necessary before an artist's audience could be determined, has now "completely changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

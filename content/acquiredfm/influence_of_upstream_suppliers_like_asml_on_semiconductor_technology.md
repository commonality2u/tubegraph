The [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] exhibits several unusual characteristics that highlight the critical role of upstream suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Role of Upstream Suppliers

A significant aspect of [[the_impact_of_technological_advancements_on_tsmcs_growth | technological advancements]] in the [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor sector]] is that key [[the_impact_of_technological_advancements_on_tsmcs_growth | technology advantages]] are primarily driven by [[collaborative_innovation_in_the_semiconductor_industry | upstream suppliers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. Companies like ASML play a pivotal role in enabling these advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### Strategic Technology Choices

The reliance on [[collaborative_innovation_in_the_semiconductor_industry | upstream suppliers]] presents a [[challenges_and_strategic_decisions_in_the_semiconductor_industry | hard choice]] for [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Historically, there have been extensive internal discussions within [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor companies]] regarding which [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | technological paths]] to pursue, such as whether to adopt x-ray lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Substantial investments were made into researching such options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

The [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | industry]] benefits from [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | predictable material performance advances]], exemplified by [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This unique characteristic offers a relatively high assurance that making the [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | correct technology choices]] can lead to significant improvements, such as a tenfold enhancement in performance within 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This predictability, driven by [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | technology choices]], is an unusual feature of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Unusual Industry Characteristics
> The [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] is characterized by:
> *   Extremely large, lumpy capital investments; a new fabrication plant (fab) can cost upwards of $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
> *   The unusual presence of [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | predictable material performance advances]] like [[the_role_of_technology_choices_and_moores_law_in_semiconductor_advancement | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

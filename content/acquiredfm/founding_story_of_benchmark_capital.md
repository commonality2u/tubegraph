Benchmark Capital, an audacious name for a new venture firm in 1994, was founded on a "religious fervor" for equal partnership among its founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This philosophy stood in stark contrast to the traditional structures of Silicon Valley venture capital firms at the time, which often led to resentment among younger partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of an Idea: Robert Cagle's Journey

The seed for Benchmark's unique structure can be traced to Robert Cagle, a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI). A 1995 New York Times article highlighted the prevailing sentiment, quoting an anonymous source about Merrill Pickard's split: "if Meryl Pickard had divided the rewards more equitably they wouldn't have split up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Cagle himself was quoted, stating, "today the power is much more distributed... Nobody can claim that they are making all the money for the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

Cagle's background deeply informed his views on fairness and equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. He grew up in Flint, Michigan, with a single mother, and his family worked on General Motors production lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. He was the first in his family to attend college, going to General Motors University, a quasi-vocational school for GM employees' families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. After working at GM, he earned a spot at the prestigious Stanford Business School (GSB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

At GSB, Cagle met Dave Marquardt, who had graduated a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. After GSB, Cagle worked in consulting at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) before Marquardt invited him to join TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Cagle thrived at TVI, making successful investments in companies like Synopsys, Avant, and Viosoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### The Conflict at TVI and the Principle of Equal Partnership

After ten years at TVI, Cagle felt that the senior partners were "holding on to the keys to the firm and all the economics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. He developed an "almost religious fervor that anything other than an equal partnership was just like morally wrong for a venture capital firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. This core belief, driven by a sense of fairness and proper rewards for proper work, would have significant "knock-on effects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

Benchmark's unique "equal partnership" meant that each partner in a given fund would have equal carry, and crucially, all current General Partners (GPs) would own the management company without paying for it; it would always be "just given to whoever the equal current GPs are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

Discussions about this model at TVI failed to reach a resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. The senior partners, having made significant money, especially from the [[founding_of_microsoft_and_its_early_years | Microsoft]] deal, decided to "declare victory" and dissolve the firm, managing out their existing funds and board seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Dave Marquardt went on to found August Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### Dave Marquardt's Investment Philosophy: A Precursor

Before Benchmark's formation, Marquardt's investment philosophy at TVI foreshadowed many of Benchmark's core tenets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. He believed the venture business was an "intensely personal relationship business" that doesn't scale well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. He opposed "value-added services," arguing companies should provide those themselves, and that "Bill Gates wouldn't let me bring in outside PR people and marketing talent. That's what Founders do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Marquardt emphasized that the CEO is "ultimately responsible and accountable for everything," with VCs there to "support and Be steady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. This approach was akin to what a [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] partner would later articulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

## The Assembling of the Founders

Cagle, preferring to continue with an equal partnership, had to seek new avenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. In early 1994, he approached his friend Bruce Dunleavy, then at Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Dunleavy, who had interned for Cagle at BCG and attended GSB after him, came from a different background, growing up in Texas, playing high school football, and studying English literature at Rice University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. He had worked in the PC industry, at Goldman Sachs, and joined Merrill Pickard, where he famously invested in Palm Pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

Cagle proposed they "bust loose" and start a new firm together, built on the equal partnership model, recognizing the emerging internet trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. Dunleavy initially declined, lacking the "Microsoft money" safety net Cagle had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

Months later, the "bug of equal partnership" infected Merrill Pickard's internal discussions, led by Dunleavy and fellow young partner Andy Ratcliffe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Cagle's decision to ask Dunleavy, his former intern, to be an equal partner, demonstrated "an incredible amount of maturity" and Cagle's "obsessive sense of fairness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. This reflected both a "religious Devotion to equality fairness" and "an absurd amount of self-confidence" in the early Benchmark founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

Bruce eventually agreed to leave Merrill Pickard but insisted they needed more partners than just two for sufficient "capacity," "diversification," and "credibility" for their fund Limited Partners (LPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. Their ideal model involved 8-10 board seats per person and no investments without board seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.

Initial attempts to recruit other experienced GPs in Silicon Valley met with skepticism; the common reaction was "you guys are freaking nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. Many preferred the established path of rising within existing firms, like [[investment_philosophy_of_howard_marks_and_andrew_marks | John Doerr]] at Kleiner Perkins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. Bruce admitted they started thinking they "were a little nuts too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>, but with their "back against the wall," they had "no other option" but to make it work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

They successfully recruited Andy Ratcliffe, Bruce's partner from Merrill Pickard, bringing the total to three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. Bruce then suggested looking beyond traditional VCs for "entrepreneurial DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. He identified Kevin Harvey, a former entrepreneur who had started two companies (one acquired by Apple, another, Approach Software, sold to Lotus, on whose board Bruce had served) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. Harvey found the idea of becoming a VC "way easier than starting another company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

This brought the core group to four: Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, and Kevin Harvey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. They initially sought five partners for a "viable firm" and recruited Val Vaden, who had also attended GSB and worked in venture, but had moved into software company buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>. By the end of 1994, the five founding partners of Benchmark Capital were assembled: Bob, Bruce, Andy, Kevin, and Val <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.

Their chosen name, [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark Capital]], was "quite an audacious name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. It signaled to the market that they were "already important" and that their "aspiration is to set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry and how venture capital is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>.

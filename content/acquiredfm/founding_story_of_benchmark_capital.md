From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The genesis of [[history_and_strategy_of_benchmark_capital | Benchmark Capital]] is rooted in the shifting landscape of [[Silicon Valley Venture Capital history | Silicon Valley Venture Capital]] in the mid-1990s, particularly concerning the distribution of power and economics within established firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A 1995 *New York Times* article highlighted the prevailing resentment among younger partners at venerated [[Silicon Valley Venture Capital history | Silicon Valley venture farms]] over inequitable reward structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Champion of Equal Partnership: Robert Cagle

One of the most vocal figures during this period was Robert "Bob" Cagle, then a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Cagle was quoted in the *New York Times* article stating, "today the power is much more distributed since the young Robert Kegel nobody can claim that they are making all the money for the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. His story provides significant context for his deeply held beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Born and raised in Flint, Michigan, Cagle came from a working-class background where his single mother and family worked on General Motors' production lines during a period of economic hardship for the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Despite limited opportunities, he was the first in his family to attend college, enrolling at General Motors University, a vocational-like training school for GM employees' families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

After working briefly at GM, Cagle earned a spot at the prestigious Stanford Business School (GSB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. It was at GSB that he met Dave Marquardt, who had graduated a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Following a stint in consulting at Boston Consulting Group, Marquardt invited Cagle to join TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. At TVI, Cagle had a successful tenure, investing in companies like Synopsis and Avant!, which generated good returns for the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

However, after 10 years, Cagle felt that despite his contributions, the senior partners were "holding on to the keys to the firm and all the economics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. He developed "an almost religious fervor" that anything less than an [[venture_capital_firm_benchmarks_unique_partnership_model | equal partnership]] was "morally wrong for a venture capital firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This conviction, stemming from a deep sense of fairness and a belief in proper rewards for proper work, became a core motivation for his future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### The Breakdown at TVI

Cagle deeply desired to transform TVI into an [[venture_capital_firm_benchmarks_unique_partnership_model | equal partnership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. When discussions within the firm failed to reach a resolution, the senior partners, having made significant money (especially from investments like [[notable_investments_and_decisions_by_benchmark | Microsoft]]), decided to "declare victory" and dissolve TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The firm managed out its existing funds, and partners maintained their board seats, but TVI ceased to be a vehicle for future investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Notably, Dave Marquardt went on to found August Capital after TVI's dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### The TVI Investment Philosophy Foreshadowing Benchmark

Dave Marquardt's investment style at TVI held principles that would later resonate with [[history_and_strategy_of_benchmark_capital | Benchmark Capital]]'s philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

> "The venture business is an intensely personal relationship business and it's not an industry that scales well," Marquardt stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. He eschewed offering "value-added service" because "companies should do that themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Marquardt emphasized that "the CEO ultimately is responsible and accountable for everything they are the ones who make the decisions the VCS are there to support and Be steady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This founder-first, support-oriented approach closely mirrored what would become [[history_and_strategy_of_benchmark_capital | Benchmark]]'s core tenets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Assembling the Founding Team

With TVI disbanded, Cagle was determined to create a new firm based on his [[venture_capital_firm_benchmarks_unique_partnership_model | equal partnership]] ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. In early 1994, he approached Bruce Dunleavy, a former intern of his from BCG and a rising "Young Turk" at Merrill Pickard, another prominent venture firm located in the same building at 2480 Sand Hill Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Dunleavy, who had a background in English literature from Rice University, worked in the PC industry, and at Goldman Sachs before joining Merrill Pickard, had a successful investment in Palm Pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Cagle proposed they start a firm together, emphasizing the equal partnership model and the coming internet wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Dunleavy, while honored, initially hesitated due to not having the same financial "safety net" as Cagle, who benefited from the [[notable_investments_and_decisions_by_benchmark | Microsoft]] investment at TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### The "Equal Partnership" Virus Spreads

A few months later, internal discussions at Merrill Pickard about their next fund began to mirror the same debates that had led to TVI's dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Bruce Dunleavy and his colleague, Andy Ratcliffe, agitated for [[venture_capital_firm_benchmarks_unique_partnership_model | equal economics]] within Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Their efforts were met with little success, leading them to consider leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

Cagle's decision to ask Dunleavy, his former subordinate, to be his equal partner demonstrated an "incredible amount of maturity" and Cagle's "obsessive sense of fairness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This "religious Devotion to equality fairness" combined with "an absurd amount of self-confidence" was a defining trait of the early [[key_figures_in_early_benchmark_capital | Benchmark]] founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Expanding the Ranks

Dunleavy agreed to start a new firm with Cagle but insisted they needed more partners than just two to have sufficient capacity and diversification for a viable portfolio, estimating a need for at least five partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. They envisioned a model where each partner would manage 8-10 board seats, making a two-person firm insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Their initial attempts to recruit other young General Partners (GPs) from across [[Silicon Valley Venture Capital history | Silicon Valley]] were met with skepticism, with many telling them, "you guys are freaking nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Bruce himself admitted he started thinking they "were a little nuts too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. However, having burned their bridges at their old firms, they felt their "back was against the wall" and they "had to go make this work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

They successfully brought in Bruce's partner from Merrill Pickard, Andy Ratcliffe, making them three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Recognizing the difficulty in recruiting traditional VCs, Bruce suggested looking outside for "entrepreneurial DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This led them to Kevin Harvey, a former entrepreneur who had co-founded two companies, one acquired by Apple and another, Approach Software, which Bruce had invested in at Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Harvey readily joined, finding the prospect easier than starting another company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

Finally, they recruited a fifth founding member, Val Vaden, who had also gone to GSB and worked in venture but was focused on software company buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. By the end of 1994, the five founding partners were Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, Kevin Harvey, and Val Vaden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## The Name: Benchmark Capital

When it came time to name their new firm for their first fund prospectus, they chose the "audacious name" [[history_and_strategy_of_benchmark_capital | Benchmark Capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This name was a bold signal to the market, declaring their aspiration "to set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry and how venture capital is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

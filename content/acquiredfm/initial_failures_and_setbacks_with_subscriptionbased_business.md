The journey of launching a paid online business was met with significant skepticism and numerous early challenges, both technical and conceptual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many, including venture capitalists (VCs), believed that [[the_future_of_subscriptionbased_media_businesses | subscriptions]] were not viable on the internet and would not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Unmet Goals and Technical Glitches

The founder set aggressive one-day, one-week, and one-month goals for new subscribers but failed to reach any of them, "pretty significantly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The initial launch was plagued by critical technical issues:
*   A security certificate problem prevented any purchases for the first 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   The founder had imposed an "artificial deadline" for the launch, driven by ego rather than necessity, adding to the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Product and Business Model Missteps

Beyond technical woes, the product itself was deeply flawed:
*   It was "super confusing" and "sucked," failing to deliver a good experience for either non-paying or paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   The initial aim of luring in non-paying customers for a "fuller experience" did not work, and the paying customer experience was "very janky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The founder realized the "business model's right, the product's wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This led to tearing out the entire new website and reverting to the old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Subscribers were informed that the extra content they paid for would be delivered via email, a complete reversal from the initial website-centric vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Personal and Financial Strain

The commitment to the venture came with significant personal sacrifices:
*   The founder had given up a six-figure job and was accumulating business school debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Credit card payments were halted to preserve cash, as Taiwan, where the founder was living, was very cash-centric at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   The workload was immense, involving writing seven times a week, producing and editing a podcast, and dealing with customer support, including processing refunds due to double-charging subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   There was a real concern about having to "go teach English again" to pay bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   The founder's wife was "very mad" about the decision to leave a stable job, leading to the founder hiding the true extent of the financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Overcoming Skepticism and Finding Traction

Despite the tough start in April 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, a "pride factor" prevented giving up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. By summer, a turning point emerged when subscriber numbers, though small (a couple of hundred), showed consistent month-over-month growth from April to July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This led to a belief that the business could work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

A significant surge in subscribers occurred in November when the product was simplified to one price and one offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This, combined with an announcement that the business model was working, led to 250 new subscribers in 24 hoursâ€”the biggest step change in growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

The initial hesitancy of potential subscribers was primarily psychological:
*   Many believed the business would fail and go out of business, fearing they would lose their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   Once it became clear that the entity was "ongoing," people felt their money would be safe and subscribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   Platforms like Substack later helped by making it easier to pay and by reducing the fear of giving money to an unknown writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

While the early goals were missed, the business eventually hit its one-year goal of 1,000 subscribers and a $100,000 run rate much earlier than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Growth since then has been "slow and steady" rather than an "explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This demonstrates how [[challenges_faced_when_starting_a_paid_online_business | initial setbacks]] can eventually give way to sustained growth when the underlying model is sound.

ARM Holdings is a company that develops the instruction set architecture (ISA) and many of the designs underpinning CPUs, which are the "digital brain of every modern electronic device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. These CPUs are found in a vast array of devices, from phones and cars to televisions and thermostats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Approximately 29 billion ARM chips were shipped in fiscal year 2024, demonstrating their widespread ubiquity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

## Genesis in Mobile: Low Power and Cost Efficiency

The company's [[history_and_evolution_of_arm_architecture | history and evolution of ARM architecture]] traces back over 30 years to Cambridge University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. ARM's original product was designed into the Apple Newton, a PDA released before the widespread internet or advanced recognition technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. The key characteristics of this early ARM processor were its low power consumption, allowing it to run off a battery, and its emphasis on performance and cost efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. This focus on low power was initially less critical when most computing devices were plugged in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>, but it became a foundational advantage for future mobile devices.

## Evolution of the Business Model for Ubiquity

ARM employs a unique [[arms_business_model_and_licensing_strategy | business model]] where it licenses its instruction set architecture or its own CPU designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Companies like Apple license the ISA to develop their own CPUs, while others like Samsung, MediaTek, Tesla, [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_market_influence | Qualcomm]], and Amazon license ARM's pre-designed CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

This [[arms_business_model_and_licensing_strategy | business model]] is based on an upfront licensing fee (a proxy for R&D) and a royalty percentage when products ship in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This "shared success model" was a "brilliant idea" by founders like Robin Saxby and Tudtor Brown, allowing ARM to proliferate its technology without needing to build its own chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

In the early days, ARM faced the challenge of a non-existent software ecosystem for its architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Its first significant design win came from Texas Instruments (TI), a major supplier of baseband chips for 2G and GSM phones in the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. TI chose ARM for a small microprocessor within its chips, primarily to assist the baseband machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. The "application" at the time was simply the phone itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This led to ARM being adopted by Nokia in their first GSM phones, establishing ARM as a "de facto standard" in the mobile phone industry due to its power efficiency and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

As mobile phones became smarter, they began to run operating systems like Symbian, further solidifying ARM's position by fostering a software development ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## The iPhone Catalyst and Smartphone Dominance

The pivotal moment that propelled ARM to the "next level" was the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Prior to the iPhone, ARM was used in the first iPod in the early 2000s, where it ran a small operating system, controlled a display, and handled a UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

When Apple was deciding on the processor for the iPhone, they considered Intel's Atom, a low-power x86 chip designed for netbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. However, Intel's Atom wasn't sufficiently low power or low cost for a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Despite Apple's significant investment in porting macOS to Intel's x86 architecture for their laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, the iPod team advocated for building up from ARM, which led to the creation of iOS, an operating system distinct from macOS, optimized for the unique power and efficiency requirements of a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

The decision to use ARM in the iPhone (with the first chip built by Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>) was a critical design win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This led to rapid adoption by the Android ecosystem, with companies like Samsung and HTC designing around ARM as the de facto standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The ability for multiple vendors to build ARM-based chips provided crucial multiple sourcing, a stark contrast to Intel's x86, which was primarily single-sourced (Intel) or licensed to one competitor (AMD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Software Compatibility and Ecosystem Lock-in

ARM's "superpower" in the mobile space, similar to x86's dominance in PCs, is its software compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. ARM strictly prohibits licensees from adding custom instructions that would break software compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This ensures that software developers can write applications for ARM knowing they will run across all ARM-compliant chips, leading to an incredibly sticky platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

The massive investment in software development, particularly with the rise of the internet and SaaS, has created a "flywheel of software" that makes it very difficult for new processor architectures to gain traction if they lack a robust software story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This ultimately left x86 and ARM as the two dominant architectures in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Continued Growth and Future Outlook

NVIDIA, a longtime partner, has also been deeply involved with ARM. After early mobile efforts with Tegra and supporting Microsoft's Windows on ARM initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, ARM became the default platform for NVIDIA's automotive Drive platform and robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. The growth of AI applications, particularly inference workloads, on edge devices like wearables and smartphones, further cements ARM's essential role due to its power efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. ARM also offers "subsystems," which are verified combinations of its IPs (CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, interconnects) that accelerate customer product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

This pervasive presence across growing end markets and its crucial role in the expanding AI compute landscape, particularly for mobile and edge inference, are key reasons for the significant bullishness on ARM's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

## Acquisition Overview

On December 1st, 2020, Salesforce announced its intention to acquire Slack for a total purchase price of $27.7 billion in cash and stock, with the stock portion being slightly heavier (roughly 55-57% stock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:09">[06:01:09]</a>. This deal values Slack at approximately $45.86 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:07">[06:07:07]</a>, representing a 55% premium to where Slack was trading before the news was leaked the previous week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:58">[06:22:58]</a>, and an 85% premium to its stock price after September earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:17">[06:30:17]</a>. This marks the first time Slack's price per share is above its first day of trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:11">[06:38:11]</a>.

The acquisition is the largest software deal since IBM bought Red Hat two years prior in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:32">[07:27:32]</a>. Slack is expected to remain independent with its CEO, Stewart Butterfield, staying with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:48">[07:10:48]</a>. The deal is anticipated to close in 2021, subject to shareholder approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:32">[07:16:32]</a>.

Financially, Slack is a moderately sized business, expected to be a billion-dollar run-rate company in the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:25">[38:18:25]</a>. It boasts 86% gross margins and recently became free cash flow positive, increasing from $10 million to $36 million in free cash flow in the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:24:26">[38:24:26]</a>. Although its year-over-year growth rate slowed from 49% to 39% in the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51:02">[39:51:02]</a>, its net dollar retention was top quartile in the emerging cloud index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:52">[04:50:52]</a>.

## Strategic Rationale for Salesforce

Salesforce's acquisition of Slack aligns with several key strategic objectives:

### Distribution and Enterprise Reach
The primary driver for Salesforce is to leverage its massive sales force to push Slack's product into large organizations where it has struggled to gain a foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:57:37">[0:57:37]</a>. Slack's historical growth has been driven by adoption in small, innovative organizations and startups, which then expand their usage as they grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:01">[27:26:01]</a>. This acquisition provides Slack with a credible path to acquire larger enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.

### The "Operating System for Work" Vision
Salesforce's press release stated that "combining Slack with Salesforce Customer 360 will be transformative for customers and the industry. The combination will create the operating system for the new way to work, uniquely enabling companies to grow and succeed in an all digital world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:03">[24:43:03]</a>. This vision positions Slack as the "new interface for Salesforce Customer 360," transforming how people communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:07">[25:01:07]</a>.

### Strengthening Against Microsoft
The acquisition is seen as a strategic move to counter [[slacks_challenges_and_competition_with_microsoft_teams | Microsoft Teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. Microsoft has aggressively targeted Slack, often explicitly calling it out in their charts and reports on Teams' user growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. Salesforce aims to build an "anti-Microsoft alliance" or "best-of-breed alliance" with Slack as its centerpiece, offering an alternative to Microsoft's integrated but potentially less specialized suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Slack Connect
Slack Connect, which allows companies to communicate in shared channels with external partners and clients, is a key strategic asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:44">[29:08:44]</a>. The number of Slack Connect endpoints grew from 380,000 to 520,000 in the last quarter alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>. This feature can humanize the sales process by integrating direct client communication within the Salesforce product, potentially replacing traditional email tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>.

> "Slack Connect represents is if you want to work with Stripe or if you want to work with Amazon and the Stripe or Amazon team thinks it's a lot easier for you to communicate in a shared channel then guess what law firm finance firm blender all of that you're going to join slack and then you're going to try it and because the product is better than a Microsoft teams you're going to love the product and then maybe you'll start paying for slack and then maybe it'll spread in your organization so I think more than anything it's a way for people to kind of try before you try before you buy the slack product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:47:00">[30:47:00]</a>

## Integration Vision and Challenges

Salesforce states that Slack will be "deeply integrated into every Salesforce Cloud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:07">[25:01:07]</a>. However, the exact product integration is unclear. One perspective is that it will primarily be a distribution deal, similar to LinkedIn's acquisition by Microsoft, where Slack remains a separate entity but leverages Salesforce's sales channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.

The idea of Slack becoming the "interface" for Salesforce Customer 360 raises questions about how Slack's easy onboarding contrasts with Salesforce's complex implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44:00">[25:44:00]</a>. The hope is that Slack becomes an "on-ramp" to the broader Salesforce ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>.

One major challenge for Slack as an independent company has been its communication and positioning, struggling to succinctly explain what it does beyond "where work happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:45:00">[33:45:00]</a>. While the product has seen significant "below the surface" development (e.g., app ecosystem, notification logic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51:00">[52:51:00]</a>, it has faced criticism for perceived slowing product velocity on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:46">[1:18:46]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Future Outlook

The acquisition signals a potential "rebundling of enterprise sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:11:58">[45:11:58]</a>, moving away from the "anyone with a credit card buys any SaaS service" era. Salesforce aims to run a "Microsoft playbook" by consolidating best-of-breed applications to alleviate procurement pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:57">[45:51:57]</a>.

### Potential Competitors and Missed Opportunities
*   **Google:** It is argued that Google would have been a strong acquirer for Slack, given its G Suite products (Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:53">[1:05:53]</a>. A Google-Slack combination would form a powerful new office bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:05">[1:06:05]</a>. Slack also had a strong integration with Google G Suite, including custom work for document sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:51">[1:07:51]</a>.
*   **Zoom:** Despite its high market capitalization and currency for acquisitions, Zoom's relatively underdeveloped corporate development function might have limited its ability to pursue such a large deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:01">[1:11:01]</a>. Zoom's focus remains primarily on its video platform, with potential for many startups to build on its API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:27">[1:12:27]</a>.
*   **Amazon:** Amazon also had a partnership with Slack, powering its video product and utilizing AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:54">[1:06:54]</a>.

### Risks and "F" Scenario for Slack within Salesforce
The "F" scenario for the [[impact_of_slack_acquisition_by_salesforce | Impact of Slack acquisition by Salesforce]] involves several risks:
*   **Strategic Miscalculation:** The "best of breed" alliance strategy might fail if large enterprises don't prioritize it, or if startups perceive Salesforce ownership as a negative, leading them to other platforms like Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:06:00">[2:06:00]</a>.
*   **Product Atrophy:** There is a risk that Slack's product innovation slows down or atrophies under Salesforce, similar to previous Salesforce acquisitions like Quip or Heroku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:25">[1:22:25]</a>.
*   **Brand "Stench":** If Salesforce aggressively cross-sells its products to Slack users, it could alienate Slack's existing user base, especially startups and tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:37">[1:21:37]</a>.
*   **Loss of Startup Appeal:** If the core value of Slack was its adoption by young, fast-growing companies as an infrastructure choice, Salesforce's ownership might loosen that conviction, as startups might prefer an unaligned, independent tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:50:00">[56:50:00]</a>.

### "A+" Scenario for Slack within Salesforce
The "A+" scenario envisions a highly successful integration where:
*   Salesforce effectively channels its sales power to massively increase Slack's revenue growth and adoption in large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:23:57">[1:23:57]</a>.
*   Slack becomes a "trustworthy vendor" for large enterprises, backed by Salesforce's seal of approval, unlocking new markets for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:24:20">[1:24:20]</a>.
*   This acquisition catalyzes the formation of an "anti-Microsoft alliance" centered around Salesforce, creating a viable new distribution channel for other best-of-breed SaaS companies (e.g., Superhuman, Coda, Notion, Figma), opening new markets for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:01">[1:25:01]</a>.
*   Slack Connect successfully humanizes the sales process and builds network effects by linking various companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:50">[1:25:50]</a>.

Stewart Butterfield, Slack's CEO, is a product-focused leader, and this acquisition allows him to continue focusing on product vision, such as Slack Connect, rather than the challenges of being an enterprise sales leader against a giant like Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:54:00">[44:54:00]</a>.

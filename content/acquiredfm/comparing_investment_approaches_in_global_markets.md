From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

[[Charlie Munger]], a prolific investor alongside [[Warren Buffett]], shared his perspectives on various [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investment strategies and approaches]] and the state of global markets during a dinner conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. He emphasized the difficulty of finding true opportunities and the pitfalls of certain modern [[investment_strategy_and_decision_making | investment strategies and philosophies]].

## Investment vs. Gambling

Munger differentiates between true [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investing]] and gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. He views sports betting and casinos as inherently not "good for America" but merely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. He noted that [[Warren Buffett]] always sought odds in his favor, preferring to be "the house" rather than the player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Munger also equates much of modern retail stock trading to gambling, where individuals trade without knowing anything about the underlying companies, merely betting on price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. He suggested that a tax on short-term gains with no offset for losses would deter this behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Algorithmic Trading and Leverage

Munger critically views sophisticated algorithmic trading, such as that by Renaissance Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. He described how Renaissance's early success came from simple pattern recognition (e.g., "up up" more common than "up down") exploiting human psychology as "natural trend followers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. He contends that their ongoing returns are achieved through increasingly high midday leverage, leading to smaller profits on larger volumes and creating "big peak leverage risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Munger personally avoids such leveraged risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Venture Capital Critique

Munger believes the role of venture capital in society is "very poorly done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. While acknowledging it as a legitimate business if done right, he finds that venture capitalists often interfere with businesses and are disliked by the founders they fund, who perceive VCs as primarily self-interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

In contrast, Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio companies do not view them as a "partner trying to help them," but rather as a stable, long-term owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. Berkshire's "Buy and Hold" approach, where they rarely sell a decent business even if offered a high price, builds a reputation for "staying with things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This contrasts sharply with venture capital, where "everybody else has a standard way of doing things" that leads to "same standard results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

Munger is particularly critical of the high fees charged by private funds (e.g., "two points off the top plus the carry," or "2 and 20" / "3 and 30") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. He argues these fees allow managers to profit handsomely while endowments often receive poor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. He states that charging such high fees is only justifiable for "very unusual results," which are hard to achieve, thus attracting "the wrong people" to the investment industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Endowments are beginning to push back, negotiating lower fees and co-investing alongside managers to align interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in Global Markets

Munger believes it is "very difficult to invest money well" and "impossible to do Time After Time After Time" in venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. He notes the current market is "so far removed from the cigar butt era" due to "so much capital and so much competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>, making opportunities "harder and harder" to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.

### Retail and Brands

Munger had a bad experience with retail earlier in his career with Warren Buffett, despite making money, due to its highly competitive nature and the high failure rate of previously "mighty" retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. However, he sees exceptions in strong brands.

*   **Costco:** Munger considers Costco one of the rare "five, six times in a lifetime" opportunities where he "knew you're right and you know you have one that's really going to work wonderfully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Its success stems from selling cheaper than anyone, efficient big stores, ample parking, focus on high-volume customers, executive memberships, and a "capital light business model" where suppliers carry inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The low SKU count is a key virtue, but Munger notes other businesses (like Gensler Brothers grocery and Floor & Decor) have also successfully adopted aspects of the Costco model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. He warns against "miscellaneous stuff" that can "eventually kill you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   **Brand Power:** Munger values brands like See's Candies, which allowed price increases without losing volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. He notes the ability to raise prices annually by 10% for 40 years without significant new capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. This opportunity arose from a family needing liquidity for death taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
*   **Pricing Power:** Munger illustrates pricing power with Heinz ketchup, where consumers are willing to pay more due to unique flavor, versus Kraft cheese, where brand loyalty is weaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. This applies to sauces and Coca-Cola as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   **Luxury Brands:** Munger acknowledges the durable value of luxury brands like Herm√®s and LVMH, attributing their endurance to a trusted brand built over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. However, he believes the chances of acquiring such brands are "so low I wouldn't even look" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

### Auto Industry

Munger views the auto industry as difficult to invest in, noting "tough unions" and the disruptive shift to electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. He highlights BYD as a "miracle" company led by a "genius" engineer who can rapidly reverse-engineer parts and aggressively grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. Despite initial mistakes and almost going broke, BYD's aggressive approach and cutting-edge electric car technology led to massive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>.

### Japan

Munger points to Berkshire's investment in Japanese trading houses as a "no-brainer" idea that occurs "maybe two, three times a century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. He noted the extremely low interest rates in Japan (half a percent per year for 10 years) combined with deeply entrenched, old trading companies owning valuable assets like copper mines and rubber plantations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. This allowed Berkshire to borrow cheaply and buy stocks yielding 5% dividends, creating "a huge flow of cash with no investment no thought no anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. Only Berkshire, with its credit and patience, could execute this trade at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

### China

Munger expresses a willingness to accept "China risk" in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>. He believes the Chinese economy has "better future prospects over the next 20 years than almost any other big economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>. Furthermore, he asserts that the leading companies in China are "stronger and better than practically any other leading companies anywhere" and are available "at a cheaper price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. He contrasts this with geopolitical concerns like TSMC, which he likes less than companies with a "real consistent brand of its own like Apple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

### Big Tech Concentration

Munger sees the concentration of investment in large tech companies like Apple as a "natural outcome" driven by "human nature and competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. He states that "everybody needs some significant participation in the 12 companies to do better than everybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. While making the list of potential candidates isn't hard, picking the right ones and investing heavily is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. Berkshire picked Apple when it got "cheap" at "about 10 times earnings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

Munger describes the current investment landscape as one where the "low hanging fruit for the idiot is not gone but it's very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. He notes that the world has become "damn near" entirely overpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>, a natural consequence of intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>. While it was "never easy" to invest, "it's harder now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. He still believes in waiting patiently for great opportunities and "pouncing" with high conviction when they arise, as "you only have to get rich once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.

## Enduring Partnerships

Reflecting on his half-century partnership with [[Warren Buffett]], Munger attributes their success to liking each other, enjoying working together, and having similar attitudes towards keeping their families safe and doing a good job for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. He also notes that successful partnerships often arise when partners are good at different things and "naturally divided" responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## General Investment Philosophy

Munger attributes unusual success to a combination of intelligence, hard work, and luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. He states that one can increase the chances of luck by starting early and persisting for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. He prefers operating with his "own money" rather than the "3 and 30 business," citing the freedom from dealing with investment bankers, consultants, and venture capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. The "point of getting rich is you don't have to need other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

Munger maintains that it is harder to invest today than it was in his youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. He also notes that most companies face significant "change and threat in their future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. He continues to apply a [[value_investing_vs_growth_investing | Ben Graham]]-like approach of buying "really cheap" "crappy company" occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. His main focus, however, is on understanding and, if available at the right price, investing in great companies.

The tradition of the Benchmark dinner, a key element in the firm's practices, was directly inspired by the historical example of Benjamin Franklin's approach to intellectual engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Franklin's Dinner Tradition

According to a biography read by Bill, a Benchmark partner, Benjamin Franklin reportedly held four dinners a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. These dinners were characterized by deep dives into specific subjects, such as finance, chemistry, and life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Inspiration for Benchmark Dinners

Inspired by Franklin's model, Bill posed the question of why Benchmark wasn't hosting similar dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This inquiry led to a "playful experiment" where the firm decided to try hosting a few dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The first significant dinner took place towards the end of 2006 or early 2007, during Peter's first year at Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This initial gathering, which included four outside guests—Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos—was described as "electric" and "amazing," creating a sense that "time stood still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

This successful initial experience laid the groundwork for the ongoing tradition of the [[origins_of_the_benchmark_dinner | Benchmark Dinner]], establishing a habit within the firm to nurture curiosity and foster "collective effervescence" among its members and guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

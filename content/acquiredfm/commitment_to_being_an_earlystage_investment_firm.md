In a candid discussion captured in season 11, episode 5 of the Acquired podcast, the partners at Benchmark Capital opened up about their steadfast commitment to remaining an early-stage investment firm [[history_and_evolution_of_benchmark_capital | History and evolution of Benchmark Capital]]. This decision stands in contrast to the growing trend among venture capital firms to expand their investment scopes to include later-stage and growth investments. Here's a detailed look at Benchmark's dedication to this early-stage focus and the philosophy behind it, as discussed in the episode.

## Maintaining the Early-Stage Focus

Benchmark remains resolute in its strategy to focus solely on early-stage investments, despite the tempting financial opportunities associated with expanding into later-stage funding [[venture_capital_models_and_strategies | Venture capital models and strategies]]. The partners highlighted that their primary motivation stems from a love of working closely with founders to build iconic companies from the ground up, which drives their decision to remain true to early-stage investments [[challenges_and_advice_for_company_founders | Challenges and advice for company founders]].

## Avoiding Conflicts of Interest

Another compelling reason for Benchmark's commitment to early-stage funds is to avoid conflicts of interest that can arise when managing growth funds [[investment_success_and_strategies_of_benchmark | Investment success and strategies of Benchmark]]. Maintaining purely early-stage investments allows the firm to fully commit to supporting and empowering founders to make decisions that optimize the long-term success of their companies without being influenced by the pressure to inject more capital at advantageous valuations for themselves.

> "Because we're not trying to make additional investment decisions, there are no alternative incentives or questions that arise, which could disrupt the relationship with the founders." - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>

## The Benchmark Value Proposition

The decision not to set up a growth fund is tied to Benchmark's belief that their model ultimately leads to less dilution for founders. By excluding themselves from subsequent rounds typically seen with firms having growth funds, Benchmark allows their portfolio companies to secure better valuations in later rounds, thus preserving founder equity.

## Embracing Asymmetry for Portfolio Success

At Benchmark, staying dedicated to early-stage investments is not just about avoiding later-stage complexity but also about maximizing fund multiples [[benchmarks_impact_on_the_landscape_of_venture_capital | Benchmarks impact on the landscape of venture capital]]. Peter Fenton expressed his hope for Benchmark to set a high-water mark for fund multiples rather than total cash returns, emphasizing that the focus on smaller, more asymmetric bets promises higher returns.

> "The hack of the Venture business, which is coupling capital from other people and ourselves with the partnership, becomes inflamed when pushing large sums of money into a company, as opposed to keeping it pure." - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>

## Conclusion

Benchmark's unwavering focus on early-stage investments epitomizes their commitment to fostering deep, trusting relationships with founders and prioritizing long-term company building over short-term financial gains [[importance_of_founder_relations_and_investments_by_benchmark | Importance of founder relations and investments by Benchmark]]. By maintaining this approach, Benchmark distinguishes itself as a firm dedicated to empowering founders without the distractions and conflicts often associated with life cycle capital providers.

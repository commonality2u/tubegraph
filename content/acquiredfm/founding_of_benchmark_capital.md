In 1995, a New York Times article delved into the politics of Silicon Valley venture firms, highlighting internal conflicts over compensation and power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article quoted an anonymous source suggesting that if Merrill Pickard had divided rewards more equitably, its partners wouldn't have split up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Robert Cagle, then a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI), was also quoted, stating that "today the power is much more distributed" and "nobody can claim that they are making all the money for the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This sentiment reflected a growing resentment among younger partners in venerated Silicon Valley venture firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Robert Cagle's Journey and Vision

Robert Cagle's personal story sheds light on his strong beliefs regarding equitable partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Growing up in Flint, Michigan, with a single mother, his family worked on General Motors production lines during difficult economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. As the first in his family to attend college, Cagle went to General Motors University, a quasi-vocational school for GM employees' families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He later attended Stanford Business School (GSB), where he met Dave Marquardt, a few years his senior, who was involved in the [[bill_gates_and_the_founding_of_microsoft | Microsoft]] deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. After a stint in consulting at Boston Consulting Group, Marquardt invited Cagle to join TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

At TVI, Cagle contributed to successful investments in companies like Synopsys, Avant, and Viosoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. However, after ten years, he felt that senior partners were still "holding on to the keys to the firm and all the economics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Cagle possessed an "almost religious fervor" that anything other than an equal partnership was "morally wrong for a venture capital firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. His stance was driven by a deep sense of fairness, ensuring "proper rewards for proper work," and addressing the economic imbalance where he felt his money was being taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## The Dissolution of TVI

Cagle strongly advocated for TVI to transition to an equal partnership model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. When these internal discussions failed to reach a resolution, the senior partners at TVI decided to "declare victory" and close the firm, especially after their success with [[bill_gates_and_the_founding_of_microsoft | Microsoft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This meant the firm was "kind of blowing up" because younger partners didn't believe the economics were fair and saw no way to fix it within the existing culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. TVI managed out its existing funds, and partners like Dave Marquardt went on to found August Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Dave Marquardt's Investment Philosophy

Even before the founding of [[history_and_evolution_of_benchmark | Benchmark]], Dave Marquardt's investment style at TVI held principles that would later become central to [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm_strategies_and_culture | Benchmark]]'s philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Marquardt believed that the venture business is an "intensely personal relationship business" that "does not scale well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. He argued against adding "value-added services," asserting that "companies should do that themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. He famously stated that "[[bill_gates_and_the_founding_of_microsoft | Bill Gates]] wouldn't let me bring in outside PR people and marketing talent â€“ that's what Founders do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. His view was that the CEO is "ultimately responsible and accountable for everything," and VCs are there "to support and be steady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This approach mirrors the core tenets of [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm_strategies_and_culture | Benchmark]]'s partner-centric, founder-first model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Recruiting the Founding Partners

With TVI dissolving, Cagle, deeply committed to the equal partnership model, needed to find a new path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. In early 1994, he approached Bruce Dunleavy, a former intern of his at BCG and now a rising "young Turk" at Merrill Pickard, known for his investment in Palm Pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Cagle proposed starting a new firm together, emphasizing the equal partnership and the emerging internet opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Dunleavy, not having the same financial safety net as Cagle (who had benefited from the [[bill_gates_and_the_founding_of_microsoft | Microsoft]] deal), initially declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

However, a few months later, Merrill Pickard also began internal discussions about their next fund, and the "bug of equal partnership" spread within the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Bruce Dunleavy and his fellow young partner, Andy Ratcliffe, raised the idea of equal economics, but it was met with resistance, similar to Cagle's experience at TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This moment is notable for Cagle's "incredible amount of maturity" and "obsessive sense of fairness" in inviting his former subordinate to be an equal partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. It showcased a "religious devotion to equality fairness" combined with "an absurd amount of self-confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Bruce, now amenable to leaving Merrill Pickard, recognized that a firm with just two partners wouldn't have enough investment capacity or diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. They needed a larger portfolio, given their commitment to deep engagement (e.g., eight to ten board seats per person, no investments without board seats), which was the TVI style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. With their "back against the wall," having "burned the boats" and with no other option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, they decided to recruit more partners.

The obvious first recruit was Bruce's partner from Merrill Pickard, Andy Ratcliffe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Together, Cagle, Dunleavy, and Ratcliffe began approaching other young GPs in the valley, but the prevailing reaction was that they were "freaking nuts" and should not "screw up a good thing" they had going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The conventional path for ambitious young VCs at the time was to rise within established firms like Kleiner Perkins, as [[andrew_marks_venture_capital_approach | John Doerr]] had done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Dunleavy even admitted he started thinking they "were a little nuts too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Bruce then suggested looking outside traditional venture circles, believing that bringing in "entrepreneurial DNA" would be beneficial for a new firm challenging the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. He identified Kevin Harvey, a former entrepreneur he had worked with and invested in at Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Harvey had successfully sold two companies, one to Apple and another to Lotus, and found the idea of joining a venture firm "way easier than starting another company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

With Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, and Kevin Harvey, they had four partners, but believed they needed at least five for a viable firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. They recruited Val Vaden, who had also gone to GSB and worked in venture, but had transitioned to software company buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. By the end of 1994, the five founding partners were assembled: Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, Kevin Harvey, and Val Vaden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Naming the Firm: Benchmark Capital

As they prepared to raise their first fund, the founders chose an audacious name: [[history_and_evolution_of_benchmark | Benchmark Capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. This name was a strong signal to the market, asserting their aspiration to "set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry and how venture capital is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. It declared their importance and ambition even before they were known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

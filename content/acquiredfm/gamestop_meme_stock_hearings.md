The "GameStop meme stock craze" was a significant focus area for at least one member of the House Financial Services Committee, comprising approximately one-third of their time on the committee during their term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The committee member actively followed the [[The role and impact of retail stock trading and gambling in the investment market | meme stock craze]] on the Wall Street Bets forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Legislative Outcomes

Despite considerable effort, there was disappointment regarding the lack of substantial [[Legislative Outcomes from the Meme Stock Mania | legislation stemming from the meme stock mania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

One main bipartisan proposal involved passing a bill to shorten the stock settlement time from two days to one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This proposed change was intended to reduce overall system risk and potentially prevent situations like Robinhood halting trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

However, instead of pursuing this direct solution, existing legislative agendas were incorporated into a bill that passed the House but was not expected to advance in the Senate, leading to no significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This outcome was attributed to political dynamics in Washington, where issues can become "political casualties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The Hearings

The House Financial Services Committee conducted multiple hearings on the meme stock phenomenon, with one member noting they had four such hearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. These hearings garnered national media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

During one remote hearing, a committee member monitored both the official hearing and the Wall Street Bets forum simultaneously on separate computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Members of the forum "absolutely eviscerated" every member who spoke, often comparing one specific member to "Hitman" from the video game or movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The sentiment shifted to approval for that member once he began asking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

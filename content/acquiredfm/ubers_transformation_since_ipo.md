Since Uber's initial public offering (IPO) in 2019, the company has undergone a significant transformation, shifting its strategic focus and operations to achieve sustainable growth and profitability.

## Pre-IPO Background

Before its IPO, Uber was notorious for its aggressive growth strategy, which involved massive capital expenditure and incurring significant losses. In fact, Uber had burned an unprecedented amount of capital, setting the record for the most capital burned by a company before an IPO, losing approximately $3 billion in the year before going public [[venture_capital_models_and_strategies | venture capital models and strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Revenue Growth and Profitability

Post-IPO, Uber has witnessed a dramatic increase in revenue from $10 billion two years ago to over $30 billion in the past 12 months. This growth is not merely a reflection of gross merchandise volume (GMV) but actual revenue [[ubers_approach_to_profitability_and_market_competition | Uber's approach to profitability and market competition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. For a company that was once far from breaking even, Uber's move toward profitability marks a significant turnaround. Although still modest, the profitability Uber has achieved was once inconceivable for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Strategic Refocus

Since the IPO, Uber has strategically pivoted its business operations, focusing on its core competencies of rides and eats while divesting from speculative, hardware, and far-future projects [[capital_efficiency_growth_strategies | capita-efficient growth strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This shift underscores a disciplined approach to business growth, emphasizing areas where Uber can leverage synergies and expertise, such as their dual business model of eats and mobility.

## The Role of Uber Eats

Uber Eats has played a pivotal role in Uber's overall business strategy, especially during the global pandemic which pivoted user habits significantly towards food delivery services [[challenges_and_strategies_of_uber_eats_and_mobility | challenges and strategies of Uber Eats and mobility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Uber recognized an opportunity in merging technical teams and marketplace dynamics between its eats and rides divisions, using Eats as both a standalone growth lever and a recruitment funnel to bring in drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

## Organizational and Cultural Changes

Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has spearheaded several critical organizational changes, aligning the company's operations and culture towards long-term sustainability [[dara_khosrowshahis_career_and_leadership_at_uber | Dara Khosrowshahi's career and leadership at Uber]]. One of the challenges faced was redefining the company's internal structure to emphasize more efficient, shared resources among technical and business teams, thus avoiding duplicated efforts and improving operational efficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

## International Markets and Expansion

International expansion has also been a key part of Uber's transformation strategy. Uber has navigated expansion by aligning local operational models with regulatory environments, a departure from the previous strategy of waiting to be invited into markets. This allowed them to enter mature but previously inaccessible markets like Germany, Japan, and Korea by adjusting business practices to comply with local laws [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_global_market | challenges and opportunities in the global market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.

## Financial Stability and Shareholder Dynamics

At the financial level, Uber's transformation is evidenced by a complete turnover in its shareholder base since the IPO. This turnover reflects the company's shift toward sustainable, long-term growth, attracting investors focused on profitability and scalable business models [[insights_into_venture_capital_and_investment | insights into venture capital and investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

Uber's post-IPO journey reveals a company in the midst of significant alteration, driven by strategic refocus, disciplined financial management, and operational adaptations to foster a sustainable business future. The changes at Uber symbolize a consequential shift from its early days of aggressive growth at any cost to a sustainable growth model focused on profitability and global industry leadership.

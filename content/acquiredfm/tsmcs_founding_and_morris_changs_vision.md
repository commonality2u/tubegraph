Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), founded by [[Morris Chang | Dr. Morris Chang]], has become a cornerstone of the global technology industry, holding a crucial position in [[tsmc_and_its_importance_in_global_supply_chains | global supply chains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of [[TSMC | TSMC]]

[[Morris Chang | Dr. Morris Chang]], who was 56 at the time, founded [[TSMC | TSMC]] in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:45">[02:14:45]</a>. By 1995, the company's revenue had already exceeded $1 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. Chang's career began at Texas Instruments (TI), where his peak role was leading worldwide semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### The "Pure Play Foundry" Vision

Chang envisioned [[TSMC | TSMC]] as a "Pure Play Foundry" – a dedicated manufacturing service that would not compete with its customers by designing its own chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. This model was revolutionary at a time when integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel dominated the industry, handling both design and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

Chang foresaw the rise of "fabless" companies—those that design chips but do not own manufacturing facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>. An early interaction in his career, where a company wanted to fund a new venture without building a fabrication plant (fab), gave him a glimpse of this future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:35">[02:18:35]</a>. The pure-play model allowed [[TSMC | TSMC]] to focus solely on manufacturing excellence and customer trust, becoming a non-competing partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>.

Initially, [[TSMC | TSMC]]'s business primarily came from IDMs looking for excess capacity or outsourcing their least critical, older-generation chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:25">[02:33:25]</a>. This was a "crappy business" in the early years but allowed [[TSMC | TSMC]] to build capability and capacity, preparing for the inevitable "fabless revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:59">[02:36:59]</a>.

## [[Morris Chang | Morris Chang]]'s Business Philosophy

### Investment in R&D and Capital Expenditure
[[Morris Chang | Chang]] learned the importance of consistent R&D investment from his time at TI, where his requests to increase R&D budgets were often denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. At [[TSMC | TSMC]], he institutionalized an 8% of revenue R&D budget, regardless of economic conditions, providing stability and confidence to the R&D teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

He also made bold decisions on capital expenditure. For instance, in 2010, he ramped capital spending threefold to nearly $6 billion, committing heavily to the 28 nanometer (nm) node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. This decision, though questioned by the board, was based on internal projections that the 28nm node would be a "sweet spot" and a critical "tide in the affairs of man" for the company, coinciding with the rise of the smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

### The Learning Curve Theory
[[Morris Chang | Chang]] was a serious student of the "learning curve" theory, having refined its application to the semiconductor industry during his time at TI, working with Bruce Henderson and Bill Bain of Boston Consulting Group (BCG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. The theory posits that as production volume increases, unit costs decrease due to gained experience and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

This philosophy drove [[TSMC | TSMC]]'s strategy:
*   **Volume Aggregation**: The goal was to become the largest volume player in the industry to achieve the lowest costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive [[tsmc_pricing_strategy | Pricing Strategy]]**: [[TSMC | TSMC]] would strategically set prices, even at unprofitable levels initially, to outcompete rivals and gain market share rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Once dominant, economies of scale would make the business highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Forecasting and Risk**: This strategy required precise forecasting of future market demand for customer products (e.g., number of iPhones to be sold) and significant capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### Talent Management
[[Morris Chang | Chang]] maintained a unique approach to talent management, contrasting with industry norms. In late 2008/early 2009, during a financial crisis and business downturn, a previous CEO laid off 600-700 employees based on performance reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>. [[Morris Chang | Chang]], who had previously advised against this, retook the CEO position and rehired all employees who wished to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. He believed in probation and transfers over layoffs, emphasizing that performance reviews are subjective and laying off skilled workers in a "Moore's Law" driven industry like semiconductors is shortsighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Key Relationships and Early Successes

### Partnership with [[tsmcs_relationship_with_major_clients_like_nvidia_and_apple | Nvidia]]
[[TSMC | TSMC]]'s partnership with [[tsmcs_relationship_with_major_clients_like_nvidia_and_apple | Nvidia]] began in 1997 when [[Jensen Huang | Jensen Huang]], then CEO of a small, struggling [[tsmcs_relationship_with_major_clients_like_nvidia_and_apple | Nvidia]], personally wrote to [[Morris Chang | Chang]] after [[TSMC | TSMC]]'s San Jose office failed to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Despite [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] being four years old, facing bankruptcy, and having only 50-60 employees, [[Morris Chang | Chang]] took the call, impressed by [[Jensen Huang | Huang]]'s optimism and articulateness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

[[Jensen Huang | Huang]] boldly predicted that their upcoming chip would save [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] and make them a major [[TSMC | TSMC]] customer. This proved true; within two to three years, [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] became one of [[TSMC | TSMC]]'s top five largest customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

A significant challenge arose in 2009 with the 40nm node, which suffered from manufacturing and quality problems, impacting customers like [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. After retaking the CEO role, [[Morris Chang | Chang]] called [[Jensen Huang | Huang]], who reiterated the serious problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. [[Morris Chang | Chang]] spent weeks analyzing the issue and offered [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] over $100 million in compensation, with a 48-hour deadline for acceptance to avoid arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. [[Jensen Huang | Huang]] accepted, preserving a partnership that has since generated billions in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Engagement with [[tsmcs_relationship_with_major_clients_like_nvidia_and_apple | Apple]]
[[TSMC | TSMC]] had been strategizing on how to win [[tsmcs_relationship_with_major_clients_like_nvidia_and_apple | Apple]]'s business, which was a "closed mouth company" that would only approach when ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. An unexpected meeting came when Terry Gou, founder and CEO of Foxconn (a major [[tsmcs_relationship_with_major_clients_like_nvidia_and_apple | Apple]] supplier and [[Morris Chang | Chang]]'s wife's second cousin), brought [[Apple | Apple]] COO Jeff Williams to [[Morris Chang | Chang]]'s home for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

Williams's pitch was direct: [[Apple | Apple]] wanted [[TSMC | TSMC]] to fab their next-generation chips. This was a surprise, as [[Apple | Apple]] wanted the 20nm node, a "half-step" detour from [[TSMC | TSMC]]'s planned progression from 28nm to 16nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. This required massive capital investment beyond [[TSMC | TSMC]]'s existing plans. [[Morris Chang | Chang]], after consulting with Goldman Sachs, decided to borrow money and take on half of [[Apple | Apple]]'s requested demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

In February 2011, Jeff Williams informed [[Morris Chang | Chang]] that Intel was also being considered by Tim Cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>. [[Morris Chang | Chang]] was not overly concerned, believing [[TSMC | TSMC]] was technologically on par with Intel, superior in manufacturing, and more trusted by customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. During a meeting, Tim Cook famously told [[Morris Chang | Chang]] that "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This meant Intel lacked the customer-centric approach of a foundry, often acting superior to its clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

The decision to pursue the 20nm node for [[Apple | Apple]] led to a significant tradeoff: [[TSMC | TSMC]] delayed its 16nm node development. This allowed Samsung, which skipped 20nm, to get ahead in 16nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. When [[Morris Chang | Chang]] learned [[Apple | Apple]] placed initial 16nm orders with Samsung, he was "shocked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. However, Jeff Williams reassured him that [[Apple | Apple]] would buy all its 16nm needs from [[TSMC | TSMC]] once [[TSMC | TSMC]] was ready, which proved true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:42">[01:53:42]</a>.

## Impact and Legacy

[[TSMC | TSMC]]'s success, exceeding [[Morris Chang | Chang]]'s initial expectations, is attributed to its unique pure-play model, strategic R&D and capital investments, and disciplined application of the learning curve theory. The company has become a "trillion-dollar company" and a critical component in the [[tsmc_and_its_importance_in_global_supply_chains | global supply chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

The Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan, where [[TSMC | TSMC]] is headquartered, is a testament to the success of a government-funded industry initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. It's a highly integrated ecosystem where [[TSMC | TSMC]], its partners (like Cadence and Synopsis), customers (Qualcomm, MediaTek), and even universities are located in close proximity, fostering rapid communication and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This dense ecosystem is nearly impossible to replicate elsewhere and has been key to [[TSMC | TSMC]]'s enduring lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

The rise of ARM architecture and its dominance in mobile and AI technology also created a significant opportunity for [[TSMC | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This opened the door for a dedicated foundry for ARM chips, a space Intel, with its x86 dominance and integrated model, could not effectively fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

[[TSMC | TSMC]]'s consistent investment in advanced nodes and proprietary packaging technologies (like CoWoS for AI chips) further solidifies its market lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. The company continues to ride the "Moore's Law is undefeated" trend, meeting the world's ever-increasing demand for computing power, which has seen the semiconductor market grow from $26 billion in 1987 to $527 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

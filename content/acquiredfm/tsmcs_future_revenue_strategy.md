## Overview

[[TSMCs strategic decisions and partnerships | TSMC's]] approach to future revenue involves a strategy of foregoing immediate profits in favor of long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The objective is to secure future revenues primarily through enhanced [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customer loyalty]] and the acquisition of new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This strategy aims to generate greater differential returns in the future through increased customer numbers and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, supported by the principle of scale economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Enablers of the Strategy

The semiconductor industry possesses unique characteristics that facilitate [[TSMCs strategic decisions and partnerships | TSMC's]] future revenue strategy:

*   **Significant Capital Investment** The industry requires extremely large and lumpy capital investments; for instance, a new fabrication plant (fab) can cost $10 billion or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Predictable Material Performance Advances** There is a high degree of predictability in material performance advancements, often exemplified by [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This unusual characteristic provides a high assurance that making the right technology choices can lead to substantial improvements, such as a 10x performance increase within 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These advancements are driven by correct technology selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Upstream Suppliers** Technological advantages are heavily influenced by upstream suppliers, such as ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This dependency necessitates difficult decisions, as seen in historical debates among [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | semiconductor companies]] regarding technologies like x-ray lithography, which involved significant investment and deliberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The software industry has undergone significant transformations, particularly regarding the dominant sectors and the underlying infrastructure.

## The Database Era (Early 2000s)

At the turn of the millennium, databases constituted the largest sector within software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. By 2000, the aggregate enterprise value of companies primarily deriving revenue from databases reached approximately one trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Data Explosion and Future Vision

A recurring theme for over a decade has been the recognition that "not all software is created equal," nor is all AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective became increasingly relevant as data generation accelerated. Currently, more data is produced annually than in all preceding years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This ever-increasing volume of data necessitates a "home" for storage, with future trends indicating even more data gathered through sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Bill Gates's Prophecy

In an exchange with Meg Whitman, Bill Gates addressed the notion that "all the interesting stuff" had already been done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Gates challenged this view, highlighting the "barbaric" way decisions were made at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He predicted a future where vast amounts of data would be stored, and machines would analyze this data to facilitate better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This vision encompasses diverse applications, such as diagnosing illnesses, educating dyslexic children, and maintaining aircraft engines, all driven by machines processing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Shift to Cloud Infrastructure

This foresight led to a strong conviction that the entire database market would be fundamentally remade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The transformation would occur in the cloud, with new solutions purpose-built for cloud environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. A key focus emerged on developing the necessary infrastructure layer in the cloud and enabling enterprises to adopt cloud technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This strategic focus proved to be a "rich vein" for development and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Packy McCormick's "Not Boring" newsletter exemplifies a new approach to integrating content and commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It has evolved from a personal writing project into a media and investment "empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, reimagining both the media and startup investing business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

## Evolution of a Revenue Model

Initially, Not Boring considered a subscription model to monetize its content, but this idea was held off to prioritize rapid audience growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>. The concern was that charging for content, especially for general business topics rather than specialized ones, would impede growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. Packy McCormick observed that readers might not pay for content covering topics like the "Mickey Mouse Club," unlike business-specific publications such as the Wall Street Journal, where companies often cover subscription costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

The pivot occurred when a sponsor, Main Street, reached out to propose advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. To attract advertisers, a "deck" detailing the audience demographics was created, highlighting that readers were typically 25-34 years old, high-income individuals in leadership positions, and decision-makers within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. This deck was publicly shared on Twitter, quickly filling all sponsorship slots through the end of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>. This strategy demonstrated the potential for significant revenue, with a stated goal of achieving $1 million in sponsorships in 2021, a target that was nearly met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:28">[01:37:28]</a>.

### Approach to Sponsored Content

Not Boring's sponsored content model is characterized by:
*   **Transparency** Full disclosure of sponsored material is provided upfront, with clear caveats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Authenticity** Content is only created for companies that Packy McCormick genuinely supports and would consider investing in personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.
*   **Quality** Sponsored posts aim to be as high-quality as regular content, with the goal of being the best piece ever written about the featured company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>. Packy remains open to discussing competitors positively and acknowledging potential weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Audience Value** The sponsored posts provide founders with insights into fast-growing startups and can serve as valuable resources for their own businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>.

This model contrasts with traditional journalism by openly integrating financial incentives with content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. While some perceive this as a departure from journalistic integrity, Packy argues that clear disclosure and a commitment to quality make the process transparent and valuable to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

## Content Fueling Capital

The intersection deepens with the creation of Not Boring Capital, a venture fund. The content acts as a powerful marketing and deal-sourcing mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:57">[02:10:57]</a>. When a founder reads Not Boring and connects with the content, the investment process becomes a "warm introduction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:40">[02:37:40]</a>, rather than a cold, transactional pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:25">[02:36:25]</a>. This alignment between content and investment allows for a different approach to venture capital, focusing on maximizing "winners" rather than rigorous due diligence to prevent "zeros" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:20">[02:04:20]</a>. The fund benefits from the audience's trust and engagement, enabling [[Solo corporation and the future of content creation | a lean, efficient operation]] without the extensive traditional venture firm structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:04">[02:11:04]</a>.

## Challenges and Trade-offs

Despite its success, this model presents unique [[Challenges and insights in content moderation and monetization | challenges]]:
*   **Reliance on a Single Creator** The business's momentum is heavily dependent on Packy McCormick's consistent output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>. If he stops writing, the entire "Not Boring" operation would likely cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>.
*   **Limited Scalability of Content** Scaling the content beyond one primary writer risks diluting the unique voice and personal connection that is central to Not Boring's appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:21">[02:15:21]</a>.
*   **Balancing Content and Business Development** Packy has "zero time" to build additional businesses around the content, which could offer higher upside and equity value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:02">[02:16:02]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Focus** Expanding into too many ventures or product lines could "dilute the core thing" and make the business seem like a "shell factory," alienating the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:30">[02:16:30]</a>. The expectation from readers is that the content remains primary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>.

## The "Not Boring" Flywheel

The success of Not Boring can be conceptualized as a flywheel, where **audience** is at the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:34">[02:33:34]</a>. The engaging content attracts a specific, valuable audience (founders, entrepreneurs), which in turn draws sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:59">[02:33:59]</a>. This audience also includes potential founders and investors for Not Boring Capital. The insights gained from venture investing can then feed back into the content, creating a self-reinforcing loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:08">[02:34:08]</a>. The primary strength of this flywheel is the strong alignment between the content, the audience, and the investing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:11">[02:34:11]</a>.

## [[The evolution of journalism and sponsored content | A New Paradigm for Media and Investing]]

Not Boring's model illustrates a powerful shift in [[Business models in the digital media and subscription space | digital media and subscription space]], enabled by platforms like Substack and AngelList <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. These platforms significantly reduce the operational overhead typically associated with media companies or venture firms, allowing a single individual to build and manage substantial operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:40">[02:11:40]</a>. This represents a "reorganization of the value chain by dismantling the vertical integration" of traditional firms, leveraging specialized external services instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:09">[02:14:09]</a>. It champions specialization of labor, where individual contributors and focused services can combine to create a sophisticated, scalable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:10">[02:14:10]</a>.

Packy McCormick's success demonstrates that by prioritizing authentic connection, transparent monetization, and consistently high-quality content, creators can build significant economic value at the intersection of content and commerce, even as a [[Solo corporation and the future of content creation | solo corporation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:40">[02:11:40]</a>.

A representative on the House Financial Services Committee estimates that approximately one-third of their time during their term has been dedicated to crypto, with significant attention also given to China and capital markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Focus on China and International Financial Institutions

A substantial portion of the representative's initial year in Congress was devoted to "China work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This specifically involved efforts to reform international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These institutions were perceived as having been "largely overrun by China," leading to extensive time and energy spent on advocating for reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

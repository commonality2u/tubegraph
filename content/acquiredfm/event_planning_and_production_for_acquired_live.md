Following the success of their previous live show in San Francisco at the iconic [[acquireds_chase_center_event_details | Chase Center]] Arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, the Acquired team decided to host another event in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The goal was to create an event that felt both uniquely New York and authentic to the "Acquired cannon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Venue Selection: Radio City Music Hall

The chosen venue for Acquired Live is [[acquired_live_at_radio_city_music_hall | Radio City Music Hall]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This venue was selected not only for its status as an iconic New York City theater that has hosted events like the Rockets, Tony Awards, Grammys, MTV VMAs, and the NFL draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, but also for its historical connection to Rockefeller's center and the legacy of Standard Oil and John D. Rockefeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

[[acquired_live_at_radio_city_music_hall | Radio City Music Hall]] is the world's largest indoor theater, with a seating capacity of 6,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Production Scale and Experience

The physical production for the [[acquired_live_at_radio_city_music_hall | Radio City Music Hall]] event is designed to be substantial. For example, the stage itself will be three times the width of the one used at [[acquireds_chase_center_event_details | Chase Center]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. While the guest joining the hosts remains a surprise, the event promises to be "an evening of surprise and delight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The show is also planned to coincide with Acquired's 10-year anniversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Ticketing and Financials

Tickets for the event on July 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> will be assigned seats, similar to a theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Attendees are encouraged to coordinate with friends and co-workers for group seating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

A [[presale_and_ticketing_information_for_acquired_live | pre-sale for tickets]] will be available by signing up at acquired.fm/nyc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This is advised as over 6,000 people attended the [[acquireds_chase_center_event_details | Chase Center]] show, and Acquired's listener base has grown, with New York being a larger listener base than the Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The tickets will be kept within a narrow price range, estimated around $100-$120, to make it accessible to as many people as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The event is not intended to be profit-generating for Acquired or for their partner, [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | JP Morgan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. All revenue from tickets will be allocated towards production costs such as set design and the hundreds of crew members needed to make the event happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Partnership and Event Goals

The event is being put on with the support of [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | JP Morgan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The primary purpose of the event is to celebrate Acquired and its listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It will offer opportunities for listeners to mingle and access special Acquired [[acquired_live_at_radio_city_music_hall | Radio City Music Hall]] merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

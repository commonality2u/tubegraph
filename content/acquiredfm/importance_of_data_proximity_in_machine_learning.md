The co-location of data and machine learning (ML) processing capabilities is a critical factor in the adoption and effectiveness of ML services. Running machine learning near the data it processes is considered the most important aspect of an ML strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Amazon's business is built on key pillars, with compute being a massive component and databases offering significant stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. [[amazons_investment_in_machine_learning | Amazon's investment in machine learning]] has grown, evidenced by the announcement of SageMaker, dedicated ML keynotes, and a variety of cloud-hosted ML offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides support for technologies like TensorFlow (originally created by Google), they also offer their own container service (Amazon Container Service, ECS) and elastic Kubernetes service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

A key insight into [[amazons_strategy_in_cloud_storage_and_machine_learning | Amazon's strategy]] is that their machine learning capabilities, while needing to be good, do not necessarily need to surpass those of competitors like Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The core of this strategy is that customers will typically utilize the ML services available where their data is already located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Role of Data Storage in ML Adoption

Once an organization selects a vendor like Amazon for data storage and migrates their data into the vendor's data centers, they are unlikely to then shop around for different ML providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Instead, they will run their machine learning workloads on AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

This dynamic means that even if Google might be better positioned to offer superior ML capabilities, it becomes less relevant if customers are not storing their data with Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Therefore, for cloud providers, ensuring competitive, though not necessarily leading, ML offerings coupled with robust data storage solutions, is a powerful strategy for customer retention and service adoption.

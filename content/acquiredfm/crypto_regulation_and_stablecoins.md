United States Congressman Anthony Gonzalez, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, has been a key figure in the **[[congressional_focus_on_crypto | Congressional Focus on Crypto]]** and Web3 technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. His work primarily centers on understanding and regulating the emerging digital asset space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.

## Anthony Gonzalez's Journey into Crypto

Congressman Gonzalez's deep dive into crypto began during a family vacation in 2020. Listening to a podcast about Flamingo DAO sparked an "aha moment," where he realized the potential of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and blockchain technology to impact society, capital markets, and access to financial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

Already on the House Financial Services Committee, he dedicated months to learning about different Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains, tokens, and decentralized applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. To gain practical understanding, he used a small amount of personal funds (a "little margin, a couple hundred bucks") to experiment with decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. He noted that gas fees quickly became a barrier with Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>. All funds used for this experimentation were later donated to the United Way, which accepts crypto donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. This hands-on experience, he states, was more valuable than just reading whitepapers for understanding the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.

## Congressional Understanding and the Legislative Process

Gonzalez estimates that roughly 90% of Congress members do not understand cryptocurrency at all, having only heard about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>. Another 5% are on committees like his, actively getting up to speed and wanting to be thoughtful, but often hesitant due to the complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. The remaining 5% are individuals like himself who have spent significant time developing clear views on the right regulatory framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. He stresses that committees are where the "real work" happens, involving in-depth hearings and policy debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

Legislating crypto is a complex process. Bills are typically proposed by members after understanding issues through hearings and then refined with bipartisan co-sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. They then go through committee votes, potentially the House floor, and then to the Senate, which often ignores House bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. The Senate requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, unlike the House's simple majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.

A key challenge in the legislative process is the "Christmas tree" phenomenon, where unrelated provisions are added to bills. A notable example involved a crypto provision slipped into the infrastructure bill, which imposed new tax reporting requirements on "brokers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. This provision was initially broad enough to potentially label any developer working in crypto as a broker, which would severely harm the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. The intent was to improve tax compliance in crypto, as it's currently easy to unintentionally break tax law due to lack of automated tracking and reporting from platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. While the senator who proposed it later clarified the intent was not to sweep in all developers, this incident highlighted the risks of poorly understood [[crypto_regulation_and_expansion_strategy | Crypto regulation and expansion strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

## Regulatory Philosophy for Crypto

Gonzalez advocates for a "do no harm" approach to crypto regulation, similar to how the Clinton administration handled the early internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. This philosophy suggests allowing the technology to develop and evolve before imposing overly restrictive regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. While acknowledging existing problems like tax evasion, he warns against destroying the entire industry prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.

He fears the administration might take a "heavy-handed" path, especially given the SEC chair's public comments on crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. This makes it crucial for Congress to pass laws, even if they don't immediately become law, to signal bipartisan principles to regulators and encourage a more measured approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.

## Focus on Stablecoins

Gonzalez predicts that early regulation will likely focus on stablecoins, considering them the "most straightforward" to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. The Terra Luna crash in 2022 served as a catalyst, making Congress aware of the risks when things go wrong and forcing members to understand the distinction between algorithmic and fiat-backed stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.

His preference is for legislation that defines "payment stablecoins" as fiat-backed, addressing concerns about reserves, auditing, attestations, and consumer protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. He suggests remaining "silent" on algorithmic stablecoins for now, as their classification (security, commodity, or something else) is less clear and they have diverse properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

The regulation of stablecoins aims to serve two primary purposes:
1.  **Consumer and Investor Protection**: Ensuring that when things go wrong, there are safeguards in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>.
2.  **Enabling Innovation**: Providing clarity to developers so they can build and innovate without fear of breaking unclear laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.

These two purposes are seen as "heavily correlated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. Most innovators want to build transformative products responsibly, but the current regulatory uncertainty drives companies like FTX (founded by Sam Bankman-Fried) to operate outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. Gonzalez emphasizes the desire to keep such innovation and job creation within the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.

The goal is to ensure that if stablecoins become integrated into payment rails and are used by everyday citizens, such as farmers being paid in stablecoins, they are "solid" and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>. This combination of consumer protection and pro-innovation through clear definitions is seen as crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. Regulating fiat-backed stablecoins first offers the benefits of instant settlement and lower fees without needing a trusted intermediary, while providing comfort about their underlying value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.

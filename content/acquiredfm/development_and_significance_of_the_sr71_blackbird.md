The SR-71 Blackbird is an iconic high-speed, high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft developed by [[the_history_and_impact_of_skunk_works | Lockheed's Skunk Works]] division. It was designed to provide crucial intelligence during the Cold War, particularly after the vulnerability of the U-2 spy plane became apparent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>

## Origins and Purpose

Following the U-2 spy plane incident in May 1960, where a U.S. U-2 was shot down over the Soviet Union, the need for a successor reconnaissance aircraft became critical. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:05">[01:55:05]</a> The U-2's primary defense was its high-altitude flight at 70,000 feet, but it was trackable by radar and not maneuverable, likened to a "school bus" in turns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:08">[01:55:08]</a> This incident proved that flying high enough was no longer a guaranteed evasion method. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>

The new program, initially a [[lockheed_martins_role_in_the_militaryindustrial_complex | CIA]] contract called the A-12 Oxcart, aimed to build a plane so fast it could outrun any missile fired at it, even if detected. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:10">[01:56:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:37">[01:56:37]</a> Its goal was to get incredible photos while flying at extremely high speeds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a> The SR-71 Blackbird was the two-seater Air Force version of the single-seater A-12 [[lockheed_martins_role_in_the_militaryindustrial_complex | CIA]] plane. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:55">[02:04:55]</a>

## Design and Technological Challenges

Achieving Mach 3 or faster speeds with a human pilot presented unprecedented engineering challenges. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">[01:57:11]</a>

### Speed and Altitude
The SR-71 was designed to fly faster than 2,000 miles per hour, or Mach 3, at altitudes of 84,000 feet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:24">[01:57:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a> It could travel two-thirds of a mile every second, meaning it could beat a rifle bullet in a race. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:41">[01:57:41]</a> The plane's turn radius was wider than the state of Ohio. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a> It set a record for flying from Los Angeles to Washington D.C. in one hour and five minutes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:06">[01:58:06]</a> As of the podcast recording, it remains the highest and fastest humans have ever flown without rocket propulsion, unless there are classified programs unknown to the public. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:32">[02:00:32]</a>

### Materials
The intense heat generated at Mach 3 speeds (skin reaching 500 degrees Fahrenheit, engine areas near 1,000 degrees, engine interiors close to 3,000 degrees) necessitated building the entire plane out of titanium. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:18">[02:01:18]</a> This was a metal no one had previously used for an aircraft, as aluminum would lose its strength around 300 degrees. <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:33">[02:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:39">[02:03:39]</a>
A humorous aspect of its design was that the metal expanded significantly when hot. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a> This meant the panels of the aircraft fit loosely on the ground, creating "panel gaps," and the plane would leak fuel after being filled. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:18">[02:03:18]</a> A custom, non-flammable fuel had to be developed by Shell to prevent it from bursting into flames on the tarmac. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:55">[02:03:55]</a>

Interestingly, there wasn't enough titanium in the United States, so [[the_history_and_impact_of_skunk_works | Lockheed]] and the government set up dummy corporations in Europe to acquire large amounts of titanium from the Soviet Union itself. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:42">[02:01:42]</a> New titanium tools also had to be created to machine the titanium parts of the aircraft. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:12">[02:02:12]</a>

### Engines
The most advanced jet engines of the era, the Pratt and Whitney J58s, could only provide about 25% of the thrust needed for Mach 3+ speeds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a> [[the_history_and_and_impact_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] engineers, led by Ben Rich (Kelly Johnson's successor), developed the innovative spike inlet system. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:23">[02:05:23]</a> These large cones in front of the engines would expand and retract to suck in, compress, and superheat massive amounts of air, providing three-quarters of the required thrust. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:53">[02:05:53]</a>

### Stealth Capabilities
The SR-71 was also the first stealth airplane, capable of evading radar detection for several years after its initial flights. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:43">[02:11:43]</a> This was achieved through its unique shape, particularly a flat bottom (as opposed to a rounded fuselage) and flush rivets, which minimized the radar waves bouncing back to the transmitter. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:24">[02:12:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>

## Development and Operational History

Development began in the late 1950s. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:44">[01:59:44]</a> Test flights commenced in April 1962 at [[the_history_and_impact_of_skunk_works | Area 51]], a remote Nevada test site previously used for nuclear bomb testing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:22">[02:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:25">[02:07:25]</a> The first official flight of the Blackbird (SR-71) occurred on December 22, 1964, achieving a top speed of Mach 3.4. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:39">[02:08:39]</a> This achievement earned Kelly Johnson his second Collier Trophy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:47">[02:08:47]</a>

The SR-71 never carried guns, only cameras, flying too fast for bullets to catch it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:36]</a> It played surveillance roles in Vietnam, Korea, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and over the USSR. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:11">[02:09:11]</a> Over 4,000 missiles were supposedly fired at Blackbirds, with none ever hitting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:25">[02:09:25]</a> It was primarily used for reconnaissance, not as a fighter or bomber. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:10">[02:14:10]</a>

## Cost and Decommissioning

Each SR-71 cost $33 million (a significant sum at the time), with an additional $300 million per year to maintain the program. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:54">[02:13:54]</a> The high operational costs and limited combat utility made it unpopular with the Air Force as a "daily driver" plane. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a> In 1970, the Pentagon canceled further orders for the SR-71 and ordered [[the_history_and_impact_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] to destroy all its titanium tooling to prevent future production. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:26">[02:14:26]</a> Existing planes remained in service. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:50">[02:14:50]</a>

## Contextual Significance

### Relationship with Satellite Surveillance
While the SR-71 was being developed, another secret U.S. space program, Corona, was also underway, run by [[lockheed_martins_role_in_the_militaryindustrial_complex | Lockheed's]] Missile Systems Division (LMSSC) in [[silicon_valleys_relationship_with_government_and_defense | Silicon Valley]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a> This satellite program, which began operations in August 1960 (three months after the U-2 incident), provided more photographic coverage of the Soviet Union in its first month than all previous U-2 flights combined. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">[01:34:27]</a> LMSSC's later programs like Gambit and Hexagon further increased resolution and coverage from space. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>

Some sources suggest that the SR-71 Blackbird, despite its impressive capabilities, may have been partly a "decoy" program. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:02">[02:10:02]</a> This theory posits that the U.S. was already obtaining extensive intelligence from secret [[innovations_in_satellite_communications_and_defense_contracting | spy satellites]], and the Blackbird served to divert attention from these more covert space-based assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a> However, the SR-71 still provided crucial real-time flexibility and could be deployed dynamically in situations where satellite orbits might not provide immediate coverage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:09">[02:10:09]</a>

### Broader Impact on Defense Technology
The development of the Blackbird exemplified [[the_history_and_impact_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works']] philosophy of rapid, small-team, high-risk innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:52">[03:27:52]</a> This approach, prioritizing "rapid delivery of superior products," contrasted sharply with the more bureaucratic, committee-driven processes that became common in later [[analysis_of_modern_defense_contracting | defense contracting]], as seen with programs like the F-22 and F-35. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:50">[02:47:50]</a> The SR-71's legacy contributed to the advancements in [[the_evolution_and_potential_of_defense_technology | stealth technology]] and high-speed flight, influencing future military aircraft designs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:12">[02:50:12]</a>

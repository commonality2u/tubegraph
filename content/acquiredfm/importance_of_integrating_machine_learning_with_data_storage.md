The integration of [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | machine learning]] with data storage is a critical strategic pillar for cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While compute is a massive component of their business, databases have also grown in importance, particularly for customer stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This focus extends directly to [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | machine learning]] capabilities.

## AWS's Machine Learning Strategy

AWS has significantly invested in [[amazons_investment_in_machine_learning | machine learning]], introducing services like [[aws_machine_learning_services_like_sagemaker | SageMaker]] and dedicating specific keynotes to [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | ML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. They offer a variety of [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_ai_model_hosting_platforms | cloud-hosted ML offerings]], including support for TensorFlow, a framework originally developed by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

AWS also manages its own container service (ECS) and elastic Kubernetes service (EKS), catering to customer demand for Kubernetes while encouraging the use of their proprietary services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Proximity Principle: Data Location Drives ML Adoption

A key insight into [[aws_strategies_for_customer_retention_in_machine_learning | AWS's strategy for customer retention in machine learning]] is the understanding that [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | machine learning]] capabilities, while needing to be good, don't necessarily need to be superior to competitors like [[comparison_with_googles_machine_learning_capabilities | Google's]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The core strategy is tied to data location:

> "Running [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | machine learning]] near your data is the most important thing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

Once a customer commits to AWS as their primary storage vendor and has moved their data into AWS data centers, they are unlikely to seek out other providers for their [[ai_and_machine learning_insights_from_nvidia | machine learning]] needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This effectively means that the choice of data storage dictates where [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | machine learning]] workloads will be run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This strategy positions AWS strongly, even if [[comparison_with_googles_machine_learning_capabilities | Google]], with its historical strengths in [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | ML]], might be theoretically better positioned to offer superior [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | ML]] services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. If customers are not storing their data with [[comparison_with_googles_machine_learning_capabilities | Google]], the theoretical advantage in [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | ML]] offerings becomes less significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The massive [[growth_of_data_and_the_need_for_storage | growth of data and the need for storage]] creates a powerful lock-in effect, making the integration of [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | machine learning]] capabilities directly alongside data storage a critical competitive advantage.

Mark Zuckerberg began Facebook as a student project, initially viewing it as a "great project" rather than a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>. He lacked the ambition to turn it into a company at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>. This perspective shaped its early development.

## Early Challenges
[[mark_zuckerbergs_reflectons_on_the_early_days_of_facebook | Mark Zuckerberg]] describes the entrepreneurial journey, especially in the early days of a startup, as "very challenging," with the constant threat of the venture dying at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. He candidly admits that the initial period was "not the most fun part of the journey" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

The company has faced more "existential challenges than any meaningful company in history" during its first 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. These challenges included various technological shifts and competitive threats, such as Myspace, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>.

A significant hurdle emerged with the transition to mobile. In May 2012, around the time of [[significance_of_facebooks_initial_public_offering_ipo | Facebook's IPO]], the mobile version was built using HTML5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:34">[01:44:34]</a>. This choice, driven by a desire for continuous deployment and a single web-based platform across various phone types, proved to be a "mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:08">[01:45:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:13">[01:46:13]</a>. The native integration was "critical" for a good user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:15">[01:46:15]</a>. This led to a painful period where the company had to pause feature development for about a year and a half to rewrite their apps from scratch for native platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:27">[01:47:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. During this time, the percentage of monetizable traffic was shrinking as mobile usage grew without corresponding revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:06">[01:48:06]</a>. This difficult period, though not fun, ultimately put them in "great shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:06">[01:49:06]</a>.

Another challenge arose from the political environment post-2016. Before this, sentiment about the company was overwhelmingly positive, but afterward, it shifted to largely negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:48">[01:50:48]</a>. [[Facebooks growth and challenges | Zuckerberg]] admits he "fundamentally misdiagnosed the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:39">[01:51:39]</a>, regretting that they accepted others' views of what they were doing wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. He believes they should have been "firmer and clearer" about the issues they were and weren't responsible for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:25">[01:53:25]</a>. He estimates this miscalculation was a "20-year mistake" that will take another decade to fully resolve its impact on the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:42">[01:53:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:21">[01:54:21]</a>.

## Strategic Approach
Zuckerberg's core strategic principle is that Meta is a "technology company that is focused on human connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>. He emphasizes building the "future of human connection," which he believes will not be constrained to phone screens but will involve technologies like glasses projecting holograms for social experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>.

Key aspects of Meta's strategy include:
*   **Technology Foundation**: The company aims to be a strong technology company, with a technical CEO and a management team predominantly composed of people who have come up through different technical pathways within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">[01:30:41]</a>. This contrasts with earlier tech companies where technical expertise was less represented at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Learning**: Zuckerberg defines their strategy as "learn faster than every other company" to build better products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. This involves shipping products "early enough" to get good feedback, even if it means being "at the line of being embarrassed" about what is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:48">[01:34:48]</a>. This differs from companies like Apple, which take a longer time to polish products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>.
*   **Open Source**: Zuckerberg acknowledges that Facebook (Meta) has been a significant beneficiary of open-source technology, using it extensively since the early days (e.g., the LAMP stack) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>. They also contribute to open source, such as with Open Compute, to standardize supply chains and reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. This philosophy extends to AI models like LLaMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:49">[01:42:49]</a>.
*   **Platform Control**: A core reason for investing heavily in areas like AR/VR is to control their own platform, preventing reliance on others who might "tell us we can't run the ad business" or "can't ship certain products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Zuckerberg estimates they could be "twice as profitable" if they owned the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:29">[02:03:29]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Vision**: [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Zuckerberg]] decided to set up a governance structure with super-voting shares after facing pressure to sell the company in 2006, when Yahoo wanted to buy it for a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:24">[01:57:24]</a>. This structure makes it "harder" for him to be fired and allows him to pursue long-term visions, even if they are initially painful for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:41">[01:58:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:26">[02:10:26]</a>.

## Evolution of Product Philosophy
[[mark_zuckerbergs_reflectons_on_the_early_days_of_facebook | Zuckerberg]] notes that product creation is a combination of "invention" and "discovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:21">[01:37:21]</a>. While they have invented seminal patterns like [[facebooks_introduction_of_newsfeed_and_platform | Newsfeed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:52">[01:38:52]</a>, they also take pride in "learning from what is working in the world" and building a better version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:22">[01:39:22]</a>.

More recently, a shift in philosophy has emerged: moving from building "good" products to building "awesome" ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:10">[02:04:10]</a>. While their current apps are "good" and useful to billions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:02">[02:05:02]</a>, "awesome is uplifting and inspiring and just like leads you to just be way more optimistic about the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:35">[02:04:35]</a>. This focus on "awesome things with awesome people" is driving investments in Reality Labs and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:09">[02:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:18">[02:08:18]</a>. This shift in priority intensified around the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a time for reflection and a decision to "double down" on these long-term ventures, despite short-term pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:52">[02:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>.

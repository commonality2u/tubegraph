Michael Mauboussin, known for his work in finance and investing, has extensively explored the interplay of skill and luck in various domains, including business, sports, and investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. His book, "Untangling Skill and Luck," draws inspiration from analytical communities like those in sports, particularly "Moneyball," and his earlier work on decision making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>.

## Defining Skill and Luck

Mauboussin provides specific definitions for these fundamental concepts:
*   **Skill** is "the ability to apply one's knowledge readily in execution or performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. This means knowing how to do something and being able to perform it when required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.
*   **Luck** is more complex to define and can delve into philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. Mauboussin outlines three key attributes of luck:
    1.  It happens to an individual or organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
    2.  It can be either good or bad, though not necessarily symmetrical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>.
    3.  It's reasonable to expect a different outcome could have occurred if time were rewound and replayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

## The Luck-Skill Continuum

Activities can be placed along a continuum based on the contribution of skill and luck to their outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>:
*   **All Skill, No Luck**: At one extreme, activities like chess matches or running races are predominantly skill-based, where the most skillful person usually wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.
*   **All Luck, No Skill**: At the other extreme, activities like roulette or lotteries have no element of skill involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
*   **Between Extremes**: Most activities, including professional sports leagues, business, and investing, fall somewhere in between, where both skill and luck play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. Basketball, for instance, is a sport furthest from randomness, with skill dictating outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

## The Paradox of Skill

The paradox of skill states that in activities where both skill and luck contribute to outcomes, as skill increases, luck becomes *more* important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. This concept, derived from Stephen J. Gould's work, has two dimensions of skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>:
*   **Absolute Skill**: The overall level of skill in a domain has never been higher, across sports, business, or investing, due to better tools and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.
*   **Relative Skill**: The difference in skill between the very best and the average has narrowed significantly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. This is evident in sports leagues, which are now global markets, attracting top talent from everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

When individuals with very high but nearly equal skill levels compete, outcomes can appear to be random or a coin toss, even though everyone involved is incredibly skillful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. This makes it extremely difficult to differentiate oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. In public market investing, this paradox explains why numbers appear more random; it's because markets are highly efficient and competitive, not because they are inherently bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

## Persistence and Regression to the Mean

*   **Persistence**: Ongoing skill is often measured by persistence; if someone performs well in one period, they are expected to perform well in the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
    *   In public equity markets, persistence is very limited, meaning last year's top performer is likely to regress toward the average the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
    *   However, in venture capital, there is still significant persistence, with the top 10% to 20% of funds consistently performing well over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. This persistence might be attributed to "preferential attachment," where leading firms attract the best deal flow, creating a reinforcing mechanism that compounds their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Regression Toward the Mean**: This phenomenon describes the tendency for extreme results to move closer to the average over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. The rate at which regression occurs depends on where an activity falls on the skill-luck continuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. On the "all skill" side, there's little to no regression (e.g., Magnus Carlsen will always beat an amateur chess player) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>. On the "all luck" side, there's complete regression (e.g., winning the lottery today doesn't change your minuscule probability of winning tomorrow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>.

## Implications for Investing

Given the narrowing of relative skill gaps and the increasing importance of luck, achieving extraordinary long-term streaks, like Warren Buffett's 60+ year track record, becomes exceptionally difficult to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. Such streaks are a combination of immense skill and considerable luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. In public markets, the distribution of excess returns has become "skinnier," meaning there's less "alpha" to be gained, indicative of the [[importance_of_learning_and_adaptability_in_investing | uniformity of excellence]] spreading best practices and techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>.

For aspiring investors, Mauboussin suggests [[finding_the_right_investment_strategy_for_individual_skill_sets | finding a game where you can be the smartest person]] at the poker table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. This might involve exploring niche parts of the market, different geographies (e.g., frontier or smaller emerging markets where diligence provides an edge), or neglected public companies not followed by analysts or included in indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>. The world of decentralized finance or crypto, despite its volatility, also presents an nascent area where fortunes can be made, though with high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.

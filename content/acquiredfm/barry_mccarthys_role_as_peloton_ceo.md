> â€” Barry McCarthy, on his decision to stay at Netflix during a crisis

His prior experience at Netflix and Spotify, where he was instrumental in significant restructurings and turnarounds, demonstrates his capability to lead a "bare bones team" and make the most of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. He has a track record of instilling confidence, particularly among investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.

### Experience Relevant to Peloton

McCarthy's background makes him uniquely suited for [[Peloton's business model and competitive strategy | Peloton's challenges]]:

*   **Subscription Business Expertise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>: He is considered a world expert in managing subscription businesses, having helped architect Netflix's subscription model and overseeing Spotify's transition to a public company with a dual subscription and ad-supported model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. This experience is critical for [[Peloton's business model and competitive strategy | Peloton's core subscription revenue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   **Financial Acumen** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>: His deep understanding of the economics of subscription businesses, including managing costs and pricing strategies, is highly relevant. He has experience in complex financial modeling and strategic finance, which will be crucial for addressing [[Peloton's business model and competitive strategy | Peloton's unit economics]] and cost structure, particularly regarding music licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain and Operations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>: While primarily a financial and strategic leader, his role is comparable to a transition from a product founder to an operational, financial, and supply chain-focused leader, akin to Tim Cook at Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>. This focus is vital given [[Challenges faced by Peloton | Peloton's inventory glut]] and supply chain issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

### Context of His Appointment

McCarthy joined [[History of Peloton | Peloton]] as CEO amidst significant upheaval:

*   **Layoffs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>: On the day of his appointment, [[History of Peloton | Peloton]] laid off 2,800 people, including 20% of their corporate staff, as part of a major restructuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. McCarthy's own experience of being fired early in his [[Career Journey of Bill McDermott | career]] provides a unique perspective on this difficult process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Founder Transition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>: John Foley, the founder and former CEO, transitioned to Executive Chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:23">[01:38:23]</a>. While Foley retains significant voting power due to [[History of Peloton | Peloton's]] dual-class stock structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:44">[01:39:44]</a>, McCarthy likely accepted the role with an understanding of full operational autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>.
*   **Financial Downturn** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:57">[01:31:57]</a>: The company had recently missed earnings, cut its outlook, and was experiencing a significant slowdown in demand after the initial boom from the [[Impact of the pandemic on Peloton | pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:57">[01:31:57]</a>. His appointment was well-received by the market, with [[History of Peloton | Peloton]] stock rising 25% on the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a>.

### Challenges and Opportunities Ahead

McCarthy's role involves addressing [[Challenges faced by Peloton | Peloton's]] bloated cost structure, excess inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, and a need to optimize pricing and [[Product Development and Strategy at Plaid | product]] strategy.

While some predict [[History of Peloton | Peloton]] may eventually be acquired, McCarthy's past suggests he aims to build a sustainable, independent, and profitable company by strategically expanding its customer base and leveraging its strong brand and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:29">[02:15:29]</a>.

[[Y Combinator | Y Combinator]] (YC) operates with a deeply ingrained focus on community and peer support, viewing its role more akin to a university than a traditional venture capital firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. This approach underpins its accelerator and later-stage investment activities, fostering a powerful [[network_effects_vs_network_economies | network effect]] that is considered its core strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.

## The YC Community Model
The initial concept behind YC was born from the insight that "entrepreneurship is lonely," and being part of a group helps founders stay motivated and learn from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>. This led to the unique model of accepting companies in "batches" that receive investments together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.

Key aspects of the YC community:
*   **Open Application System** YC accepts applications from anyone, globally, without requiring prior connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. This contrasts with traditional [[Venture capital dynamics and firm structure | VC firms]] that often rely on existing networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.
*   **Peer Group Learning** Founders learn from one another in a peer-group setting, which is fundamental to the YC approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.
*   **WhatsApp Communication** The entire YC network, comprising around 4,000 companies and over 8,500 alumni, communicates extensively through WhatsApp groups, ensuring constant buzzing interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:15">[01:52:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:21">[01:52:21]</a>.
*   **Lifelong Partnership** YC aims to be a lifelong partner for its enduring companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. This means supporting founders through various stages, from acceleration to IPO and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>.
*   **Founder-Centric Support** The YC founder sees the organization not merely as an investor but as a "parent," often reaching out to their YC partner first during urgent issues, even years after graduating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>. This relationship is built on trust and a shared mission to help founders succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.
*   **Community Values and Ethics** Unlike typical [[Venture capital dynamics and firm structure | VC firms]], YC has written community values, an internal "book face," and an ethics code, demonstrating its unique, community-first structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

## YC Continuity: Extending the Network
The YC Continuity Fund was launched in July 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a> as a response to founders seeking continued support beyond the accelerator phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. This multi-stage fund primarily focuses on growth-stage investments (Series B and above) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.

### Post-Batch Programming
[[Founders insights and mentorship at Y Combinator | Founders insights and mentorship at Y Combinator]] are a cornerstone of YC's continued support. YC Continuity runs several programs:
*   **Series A Program** This program guides founders on how to raise their Series A round, including pitch decks, negotiating term sheets, and identifying investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   **Post-A Program** A six-week program that re-batches companies after they raise their Series A. Here, established "scale founders" teach new founders how to form recruiting teams and hire engineers, adapting to the changing role of a CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Program** This eight-week program focuses on how to scale as a CEO, covering topics like hiring executives, performance management, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. Prominent founders like Tony Xu of DoorDash and their executives contribute to these sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.
*   **Pre-IPO Program** YC is developing a pre-IPO program to support companies preparing for public markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>.

### Investing in Founders, Not Just Metrics
YC's investment strategy, especially at the growth stage, prioritizes the qualities of the founder over solely relying on metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. They look for three key attributes in founders:
1.  **Speed** How fast a founder moves, ships, and iterates, indicating their ability to learn from early decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.
2.  **Hiring Ability** The founder's effectiveness in [[Recruiting Founders and the Key to Startup Success | hiring]] engineers and convincing top executives to join their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.
3.  **Clarity of Thought** The ability to articulate a clear vision for how their company can achieve a multi-billion-dollar valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.

If these qualities are strong, YC believes the metrics will follow, and they can actively influence company building through best practices and shared learnings from experienced founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>.

## Global Reach and Future Ambition
[[The global reach and growth of Y Combinators accelerator program | The global reach and growth of Y Combinators accelerator program]] is a significant aspect of YC's community building. Post-pandemic, all YC batches have been fully remote, allowing for greater international participation, with 50% of batches being international <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. YC has investments in India, London, Latin America, and the Middle East, reflecting its mission to enable entrepreneurship globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.

YC aspires to increase its batch sizes to 1,000 or 2,000 companies in the future, believing that talent is everywhere and deserves a first opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. Despite growing batch sizes, the acceptance rate remains below 3%, maintaining a high bar for founders working on unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

## The Enduring Power of the YC Community
The strength of YC lies in its [[importance_of_community_and_support_networks | community and support networks]]. The biggest risk to YC's dominance would be "messing up the YC community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>. This is because its platform exists solely due to its founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. YC understands that while [[network_effects_vs_network_economies | network effects]] are powerful, they can also decelerate quickly if the community is not nurtured effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>.

The [[acquired_community_and_engagement | Acquired community and engagement]] reflects a similar dedication, highlighting the critical role of audience engagement and community building in media as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

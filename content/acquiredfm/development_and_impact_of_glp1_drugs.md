The company [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]] is behind the sensational diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, which are types of GLP1s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. When Ozempic was first learned about, it was thought it could potentially disrupt the market for insulin, but it turns out [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]] is already one of the few big insulin companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Uniquely, the vast majority of [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]]'s revenue is concentrated in metabolic health, having been the insulin and diabetes company for the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This pharmaceutical giant is also owned and controlled by a non-profit foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The market for these drugs is enormous, with around a billion people worldwide suffering from obesity, including 40% of the US population, and 75% of Americans being overweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Globally, over 500 million people have diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This massive market potential has made [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]] Europe's largest company, surpassing LVMH in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Early Research and Development

The molecule semaglutide, found in Ozempic and Wegovy, was pioneered by [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]] with the first trial for type 2 diabetes treatment in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This was built on research that began in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The fact that GLP1 drugs could reduce food intake was discovered in the mid-1990s, but clinical trials truly demonstrating their effectiveness only finished in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Lotte Bjerre Knudsen's Role

Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, a key researcher at [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]], joined the company in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:01">[01:44:01]</a>. In the early to mid-1990s, she started investigating academic research on glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:57">[01:45:57]</a>. The idea was that increasing GLP1 in patients could stabilize insulin production and treat type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>. However, GLP1 only remains active in the body for about five minutes before being metabolized, leading many in the industry to abandon it as a drug candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>.

Facing internal pressure and an ultimatum to produce a drug candidate within a year by the mid-1990s, Knudsen developed liraglutide, a GLP1 analog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>. This analog included a fatty acid grafted onto the molecule, preventing the body from breaking it down quickly. This breakthrough gave liraglutide a half-life of 13 hours in the human body, compared to 2.5 minutes for natural GLP1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>. This innovation eventually led to liraglutide becoming a once-a-day drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:28">[01:50:28]</a>.

### The Gila Monster Discovery

Concurrently with Knudsen's work at [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]], two American researchers in the VA hospital system discovered that a hormone in the venom of the Gila monster lizard was also a GLP1 analog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:59">[01:51:59]</a>. This Gila monster GLP1 analog acted similarly to human GLP1 but did not break down within five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:33">[01:52:33]</a>. Daniel Drucker, a researcher at the University of Toronto, experimented with this venom, and it became a drug candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:54">[01:53:54]</a>.

## Market Entry and Impact

Eli Lily licensed this Gila monster-derived GLP1 analog and developed it into Byetta, the world's first GLP1 analog drug, which hit the market in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:08">[01:54:08]</a>. While effective, Byetta was not overwhelmingly more effective than traditional oral anti-diabetics like metformin, and its half-life required two injections per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:37">[01:54:37]</a>.

In 2010, [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]]'s liraglutide (marketed as Victoza for diabetes) finally hit the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:05">[02:08:05]</a>. Victoza was an enormous hit, generating over $1 billion in sales in its first full year on the market (2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>. This success was partly due to off-label use for weight loss, as doctors could prescribe it for conditions other than its FDA-approved indication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:53">[02:09:53]</a>.

### The Stigma of Weight Loss Drugs

Historically, there has been a significant stigma around weight loss drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:36">[02:00:36]</a>. Obesity has been widely viewed as a personal responsibility problem, despite scientific evidence to the contrary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>. Past weight loss medications like Fen-Phen (which caused major heart damage in the 1990s) reinforced this negative perception and made pharmaceutical companies wary of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:36">[02:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a>. As late as 2005, [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]]'s CEO stated that obesity was "primarily a social and cultural problem" with "no business for [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]] in that area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:14">[02:04:14]</a>.

Despite this, Knudsen's team pushed for liraglutide to be pursued as a weight management drug, confident in its safety due to over a decade of rigorous trials for diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. In 2007, [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]] began human trials for a slightly higher dose of liraglutide for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:11">[02:06:11]</a>. This led to the approval of Saxenda (the official weight loss version of liraglutide) in 2014, but its average BMI reduction of 8% fell short of the "magical" 10% threshold considered necessary for a significant market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:59">[02:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:20">[02:12:20]</a>.

### The Rise of Semaglutide: Ozempic and Wegovy

In 2016, [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]] began phase three trials for semaglutide, their next-generation GLP1 analog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>. Semaglutide offered several advantages over liraglutide:
*   **Longer-lasting:** It only needs to be injected once per week, a massive convenience benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:15:39]</a>.
*   **More effective for weight loss:** It demonstrated 15% or more long-term BMI reduction, surpassing the 10% threshold that industry experts considered a game-changer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:56">[02:15:56]</a>.

Ozempic (for diabetes) hit the market in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:16">[02:19:16]</a>. It became a huge hit, generating over $1 billion in revenue in its first year despite being supply-constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:28">[02:19:28]</a>. In 2021, Wegovy (the official FDA-approved weight loss version of semaglutide) launched in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Wegovy received the same number of prescriptions in just over one month as Saxenda had in its entire drug lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:10">[02:21:10]</a>. The New York Times called it a "game-changer," noting its effectiveness in preventing obesity's worst consequences, including diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>.

The success of semaglutide caused [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]]'s market cap to go vertical, climbing from over $100 billion in 2020 to flirt with the half-a-trillion-dollar mark by late 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:11">[02:22:11]</a>. By 2023, 69% of [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]]'s revenue came from GLP1 drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:31">[02:23:31]</a>, cementing its transition from primarily an insulin company to a GLP1 company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:29">[02:20:29]</a>.

## Mechanism and Side Effects

GLP1 drugs work by mimicking the natural GLP1 hormone produced in the gut, which travels to the brain to trigger feelings of satiation and fullness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:49">[02:16:49]</a>. This helps quiet hunger impulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>. They also slow digestion, causing food to move more slowly through the digestive system, further contributing to feelings of fullness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18">[02:17:18]</a>.

Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:43">[02:17:43]</a>. Approximately one out of six patients experience side effects severe enough to discontinue the drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:54">[02:17:54]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Accessibility

In the US, the sticker price for Ozempic is over $1,000 per month and Wegovy is over $1,300 per month before insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:30">[02:27:30]</a>. In contrast, Ozempic costs $147/month in Canada and $93/month in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:47">[02:27:47]</a>.

Insurance coverage in the US is complex, often outsourced to Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:33">[02:24:33]</a>. PBMs negotiate rebates with manufacturers, which significantly lower the net price of the drug, though the listed price remains high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:47">[02:29:47]</a>. This system, with many middlemen, makes it difficult for demand signals to reach manufacturers and for consumers to understand the true cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:31">[02:25:31]</a>.

A major challenge for payers is the incentive misalignment due to the average American holding a job for only 3.7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:34">[02:28:34]</a>. Insurers are incentivized to cover only expenses that pay back within that timeframe or are in high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>. Long-term benefits, such as preventing future obesity-related complications that would cost hundreds of thousands, are often offloaded to future insurers or Medicare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:20">[02:29:20]</a>.

Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs for those over 65, is legally prohibited from paying for weight loss medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53">[02:30:53]</a>. This stems from a persistent stigma that views obesity as a "lifestyle problem" rather than a disease, despite scientific evidence to the contrary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:14">[02:31:14]</a>. If GLP1s are proven to reduce serious complications later in life, the American taxpayer could see a significant benefit from earlier investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:48">[02:32:48]</a>.

Payers are also concerned about the short-term costs, as 40% of the population is obese, and the list price of these drugs exceeds $12,000 per person per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:16">[02:34:16]</a>. This leads to intentional slow-rolling and campaigning to encourage other interventions before these expensive drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:32">[02:34:32]</a>.

An additional challenge is non-adherence. Research indicates that as many as 68% of people stop taking GLP1s after a year due to price, changing insurance, supply constraints, or side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:10">[02:39:10]</a>.

## Competition and Future Potential

Other pharmaceutical companies are rapidly entering the GLP1 market. Eli Lily has Mounjaro (tirzepatide), a GLP1 and GIP receptor agonist, which was approved for diabetes in May 2022 and for weight loss (Zepbound) in November 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a>. Tirzepatide appears to be as, if not more, effective than semaglutide for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:21">[02:35:21]</a>.

This competition is expected to drive further innovation and increase supply, similar to the historical development of insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:13">[02:36:13]</a>. [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]] has its own next-generation GLP1 drugs in the pipeline, such as CagSema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:35">[02:36:35]</a>. Eli Lily also has a triple agonist, retatrutide, in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:19">[02:37:19]</a>.

Beyond diabetes and obesity, semaglutide's long half-life means it reaches other tissues in the body, showing potential benefits for various organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:41">[02:25:41]</a>. [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]] is currently conducting clinical trials for semaglutide's use in treating cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, and kidney disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:22">[02:26:22]</a>. If these indications are approved, GLP1s could earn the title of "miracle drug" with broad applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:57">[02:26:57]</a>.

However, potential downsides are being studied. Early research suggests that GLP1s may lead to a disproportionate loss of lean muscle mass (around 40% compared to 25% with traditional weight loss methods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:50">[02:35:50]</a>. While the benefits for obese individuals likely outweigh this, it's an ongoing area of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:19">[02:36:19]</a>. Concerns about suicidal thoughts as a side effect have also been raised, but current research indicates this is not a major risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:38">[02:36:38]</a>.

## Conclusion: A New Super Cycle?

The trajectory of GLP1 drugs suggests the initiation of a new super cycle in pharmaceutical development, mirroring the century-long evolution and impact of insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:56">[02:36:56]</a>. The market size for these drugs is enormous, with demand significantly outpacing supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:53">[02:19:53]</a>. The ability to continually innovate and stack patentable improvements on existing molecules, along with unique delivery mechanisms, provides strong defensibility for market leaders like [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:52">[02:46:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:25">[02:47:25]</a>.

The [[the_impact_and_future_of_obesity_treatments_like_ozempic | impact and future of obesity treatments like Ozempic]] is profound, potentially reshaping how society views and treats chronic diseases. The long-term focus and mission-driven approach of companies like [[novo_nordisks_insulin_and_diabetes_history | Novo Nordisk]], coupled with the vast societal need, have positioned GLP1s to be one of the most important drug developments of the 21st century.

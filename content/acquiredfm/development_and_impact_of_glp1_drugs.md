GLP1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, have emerged as significant treatments for diabetes and weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] is the primary company behind these medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Although initially perceived as a potential threat to the [[Insulin market and pricing dynamics | insulin market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] is, in fact, one of the leading producers of [[Insulin market and pricing dynamics | insulin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The company's revenue is heavily concentrated in metabolic health, a category it has dominated as an [[Insulin market and pricing dynamics | insulin]] and diabetes company for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The global market for these drugs is vast:
*   Over 500 million people worldwide have diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   Approximately 1 billion people globally struggle with obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, including 40% of the U.S. population, with 75% of Americans being classified as overweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
This immense market potential has propelled [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] to become Europe's largest company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Development History

The GLP1 drug class, despite its recent public prominence, stems from decades of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   Semaglutide, the active molecule in Ozempic and Wegovy, was first trialed by [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] in 2008 for type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, building on research initiated in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   The observation that GLP1 could reduce food intake dates back to the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   However, comprehensive clinical trials proving its efficacy for weight loss only concluded in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### The Challenge of GLP1 Stability

The natural GLP1 hormone only remains active in the human body for about five minutes before being metabolized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. This short half-life made it difficult to use as a therapeutic drug for type 2 diabetes, leading many in the industry and academic community to abandon it as a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:19">[01:47:19]</a>.

### Lotte Bjerre Knudsen's Breakthrough

Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, a scientist at [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], began researching GLP1 in the early to mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:57">[01:45:57]</a>. Despite facing pressure to abandon the program, she persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:42">[01:47:42]</a>. Her breakthrough came with the development of liraglutide, a GLP1 analog that includes a fatty acid grafted onto the molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>. This modification prevents the body from quickly breaking it down, extending its half-life to 13 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:04">[01:49:04]</a>, making it suitable for once-daily injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:28">[01:50:28]</a>. The fatty acid allows the molecule to bind to albumin, a common protein in the bloodstream, protecting it from degradation by enzymes and clearance in the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>.

### The "Gila Monster" Discovery

Concurrently with Knudsen's work at [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], two American researchers in the VA hospital system discovered that a hormone in the venom of the Gila monster lizard also acted as a GLP1 analog that resisted rapid breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>. Daniel Drucker, a researcher at the University of Toronto (the same institution where [[Insulin market and pricing dynamics | insulin]] was first discovered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:28">[01:53:28]</a>, experimented with this venom. This discovery led to the development of Byetta, the world's first GLP1 analog drug, which was licensed to [[Eli Lilly and Company | Eli Lilly]] and launched in 2005 for type 2 diabetes treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>. Byetta, however, required two injections per day and was not overwhelmingly more effective than existing oral anti-diabetics like metformin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.

## Market Entry and Impact

### Victoza and Saxenda

In 2010, [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] received approval for Victoza (liraglutide), its once-daily GLP1 analog for diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:05">[02:08:05]</a>. Victoza quickly became a "Blockbuster" drug, achieving over $1 billion in annual sales in its first full year (2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>. Much of this success was driven by its off-label use for weight loss, as doctors have the discretion to prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:53">[02:09:53]</a>.

While Victoza helped with weight loss, its effects were not life-changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:07">[02:11:07]</a>. In 2013, [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] submitted Saxenda, a slightly higher-dose version of liraglutide, for official weight loss approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>. Saxenda yielded an average of 8% BMI reduction, which was meaningful but did not reach the "magical" 10% threshold generally considered impactful in weight loss research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>. The stigma around weight loss drugs, combined with past failures like Fen-Phen, also presented a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:36">[02:00:36]</a>.

### Ozempic and Wegovy

[[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] began phase three trials for its next-generation GLP1 analog, semaglutide, around 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>. Semaglutide offered significant advantages over liraglutide:
*   **Longer-lasting**: Only requires once-weekly injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:15:39]</a>.
*   **More effective for weight loss**: Achieves 15%+ long-term BMI reduction, surpassing the 10% "magical threshold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:03">[02:16:03]</a>.

Ozempic (semaglutide for diabetes) hit the market in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:16">[02:19:16]</a>, generating over $1 billion in revenue in its first year (2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:25">[02:19:25]</a> and being massively supply-constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:37">[02:19:37]</a>. Wegovy (semaglutide for weight loss) received FDA approval in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:21">[02:19:21]</a>. Its launch saw a rapid adoption, with the same number of prescriptions written in just over a month as Saxenda had in its entire lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:07">[02:21:07]</a>. This led to significant media attention, with *The New York Times* calling it a "GameChanger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:42">[02:21:42]</a>.

### Mechanism of Action and Side Effects

GLP1s work by mimicking the natural GLP1 hormone produced in the gut. This hormone travels to the brain, triggering satiety signals that make a person feel full and reducing hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:49">[02:16:49]</a>. They also slow down digestion, contributing to a prolonged feeling of fullness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18">[02:17:18]</a>. This dual mechanism helps change eating habits without necessarily requiring as much conscious effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:46">[02:18:46]</a>.

Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:43">[02:17:43]</a>. Approximately one in six patients experience severe side effects leading to drug discontinuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:54">[02:17:54]</a>. Concerns have also been raised about potential lean muscle mass loss and suicidal thoughts, though regulators have not indicated the latter as an actual issue based on broad population studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:50">[03:35:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:34">[03:36:34]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Competition

### Pricing and Access

In the U.S., the sticker price for Ozempic is over $1,000 per month, and Wegovy is over $1,300 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:30">[02:27:30]</a>. This contrasts sharply with prices in Canada ($147/month) and the UK ($93/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:47">[02:27:47]</a>, highlighting a uniquely American problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:55">[02:27:55]</a>.

Insurance coverage in the U.S. is complicated by misaligned incentives and short time horizons. Private insurers often avoid covering long-term chronic conditions like obesity because employees typically change jobs within 3.7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:34">[02:28:34]</a>, meaning the long-term cost savings from preventing future complications (e.g., hundreds of thousands in diabetes treatment) would not be realized by the current insurer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:28">[02:29:28]</a>. Medicare Part D, the federal prescription drug program for those over 65, is legally prohibited from covering weight loss drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53">[02:30:53]</a>, partly due to the long-standing stigma that obesity is a "lifestyle problem" rather than a disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:14">[02:31:14]</a>.

Despite the high list prices, many patients with insurance pay around $300 a month after co-pays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:02">[02:38:02]</a>. However, this still presents a significant access problem for those who cannot afford the annual out-of-pocket costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:55">[02:38:55]</a>. Payers are also cautious about covering these drugs due to the potential short-term costs if a large portion of the obese population seeks treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:06">[02:34:06]</a>.

### Competition and Future Pipeline

Other pharmaceutical companies are also entering the GLP1 market. [[Eli Lilly and Company | Eli Lilly]] now has a GLP1 diabetes treatment, Mounjaro (tirzepatide), which appears to be as effective, if not more so, for weight loss than semaglutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:11">[02:35:11]</a>. Tirzepatide is a dual agonist, combining GLP1 and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:30">[02:35:30]</a>. It was approved for diabetes in the U.S. in May 2022 and for weight loss (under the brand name Zepbound) in November 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:49">[02:35:49]</a>.

This competition is expected to drive further innovation and increase supply, similar to the historical development of [[Insulin market and pricing dynamics | insulin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:14">[02:36:14]</a>. [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] has its own next-generation GLP1 drugs in the pipeline, such as CagSema, which they believe will rival or surpass [[Eli Lilly and Company | Eli Lilly]]'s offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:35">[02:36:35]</a>. [[Eli Lilly and Company | Eli Lilly]] also has a triple agonist, retatrutide, in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:19">[02:37:19]</a>.

Another innovation is oral semaglutide (Rybelsus), a once-daily pill for those who prefer not to use injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:37">[02:53:37]</a>. This oral version, while a significant engineering feat, is currently not quite as effective as the injectable form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:52">[02:53:52]</a>.

## Broader Societal Impact

The success of GLP1 drugs has dramatically increased [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]]'s market capitalization, which rose from over $100 billion in 2020 to flirting with the half-trillion-dollar mark in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:11">[02:22:11]</a>. Revenue also surged from $20 billion in 2019 to $30 billion in 2022, with a 30% year-on-year growth in the first three quarters of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>. GLP1-related drugs now account for 69% of [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]]'s revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:31">[02:23:31]</a>.

The long half-life of semaglutide means it reaches other tissues in the body, showing potential benefits beyond diabetes and obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:02">[02:26:02]</a>. [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] is currently conducting clinical trials for semaglutide to treat cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, and kidney disease, indicating its potential to become a true "miracle drug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:19">[02:26:19]</a>.

Despite high profitability, the pharmaceutical industry as a whole faces challenges, including high R&D costs (averaging $2.3 billion to bring a drug to market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>. The success of a few "Blockbuster" drugs subsidizes many failures; only 10% of drugs entering clinical development make it to market, and one drug provides half the industry's profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:32">[03:12:32]</a>.

GLP1 drugs highlight the ongoing debate in healthcare about cost, access, and the nature of disease. The rising cost of healthcare, especially for chronic conditions like obesity, which leads to numerous comorbidities, poses a significant societal challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:36">[03:36:36]</a>. The question remains whether society will invest early in preventative treatments like GLP1s to reduce greater costs and suffering later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:17">[02:33:17]</a>.

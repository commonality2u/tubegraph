From 1995 to 2014, a period often perceived as Microsoft's "fall" culturally and in the consumer market, the company faced significant challenges in timing and execution across various consumer-facing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Despite these struggles, Microsoft grew its annual revenue from $6 billion to $80 billion, largely due to cracking the code on selling enterprise software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The narrative that innovation was replaced by bureaucracy and teamwork by internal politics, leading to a period where "Microsoft was winning and then it sucked for a long time," is nuanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Early Online Services and the "Information Super Highway"

Before the internet became ubiquitous, Microsoft initially focused on proprietary "walled garden" online services, like CompuServe or AOL, which were accessible via dial-up modems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. In 1993, Microsoft explored acquiring AOL and, after it fell through, launched its own internal project called "Project Marvel" to build a competing online service, which eventually became MSN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

Many believed the future of online interaction would be the "information Super Highway" via interactive television, mediated by cable and satellite companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. Microsoft sought partnerships with these companies, envisioning a "Cable Soft" joint venture where Microsoft would provide software for set-top boxes and back-end servers (code-named "Tiger") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. Bill Gates even wrote a book, *The Road Ahead*, in late 1995 to evangelize this vision, though later editions had to be revised to include the internet due to its rapid rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:16]</a>. This "information Super Highway" never materialized at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>.

## The Browser Wars and [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | Antitrust Implications]]

Microsoft's pivot to the internet began in earnest in 1994, spurred by internal memos highlighting the exponential growth of Mosaic, an early web browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. Bill Gates declared the internet "the highest level of importance" for Microsoft, seeing it as "the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>.

When Netscape Navigator, founded by Mark Andreessen, gained massive traction and threatened to "reduce Windows to a poorly debugged set of device drivers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>, Microsoft acquired a license to Mosaic's source code from Spyglass and used it as the foundation for Internet Explorer (IE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>. While the public narrative was that Microsoft simply grabbed Andreessen's code, the reality was more complex, requiring significant rework to integrate it into Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>.

Internet Explorer was initially sold as part of a "Plus Pack" for Windows 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:22:00">[40:22:00]</a>. However, to combat Netscape, Microsoft made IE free and bundled it with every copy of Windows 95 starting December 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:45:00">[41:45:00]</a>. This move devastated Netscape, whose stock dropped by a third and never recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:57:00">[41:57:00]</a>. By 2000, IE held nearly 100% of the worldwide browser market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a>. This aggressive strategy also led to Microsoft's infamous 1998 [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | antitrust lawsuit]] by the US Department of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:00:00">[53:00:00]</a>.

## Windows XP and Early Hardware Ventures

Windows XP, launched in 2001 amidst the [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | antitrust trial]], was a massive success, selling over half a billion copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. It unified Windows under the more robust NT architecture, combining the ease of use of Windows 9x with the power of NT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. XP embraced digital media, allowing users to import digital photos, music, and video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:29">[02:01:29]</a>.

Microsoft also ventured into consumer hardware during this period, most notably with the Xbox, launched in November 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:26">[02:09:26]</a>. While Xbox has become an important part of the gaming world, it has historically been a "break-even business" for Microsoft, often operating at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:08">[02:10:08]</a>. The gaming division consumed a significant amount of Microsoft's "best people" and talent, with some suggesting it was a "sinkhole" for product talent without meaningful financial returns for the wider company in its early years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:53">[02:12:53]</a>.

## Vista and Declining Consumer Relevance

The follow-up to Windows XP, code-named "Longhorn" (and later released as Windows Vista in 2006), proved to be a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:30">[02:16:30]</a>. Development was plagued by technical ambition (new graphics engine "Avalon", web services framework "Indigo", and object-oriented file system "WinFS"), internal disarray, and a lack of clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:49">[02:18:49]</a>. Vista's release was delayed for five years, and when it finally shipped, it was buggy, confusing, and required powerful hardware that many OEMs weren't focusing on for their netbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:01">[02:20:01]</a>.

A feature called User Access Control (UAC) constantly overwhelmed users with dialog boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:45">[02:24:45]</a>. Vista's poor reception led to corporate users largely avoiding it, with three-quarters of corporate PCs still running XP years after Vista's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:24">[02:25:24]</a>. Microsoft even had to extend the ability for OEMs to sell XP machines for two more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:50">[02:25:50]</a>. This era also saw Apple's "Mac vs. PC" ads, which, while not significantly impacting market share, "hit a nerve" with consumers and within Microsoft, highlighting their falling relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Vista was culturally and emotionally damaging to Microsoft, contributing to a "mental breakdown for the whole company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Mobile and Search Struggles

Microsoft also faced significant challenges in the burgeoning mobile and search markets. Prior to the iPhone, Microsoft had Windows Mobile, an operating system for handsets that was viewed as an "ingredient" for phone makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. These devices were designed to integrate with Windows PCs and corporate networks, catering to business users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:21">[03:06:21]</a>.

When the iPhone was announced in 2007, Steve Ballmer famously dismissed it, stating it would never work at $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:40">[03:09:40]</a>. This showed a fundamental misunderstanding of the shifting paradigm toward high-quality user experiences and carrier subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>. Microsoft's Windows Phone, launched later, attempted to compete with a new UI ("Metro") but clung to the old OEM licensing business model, which was quickly outmaneuvered by Google's free, open-source Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:19">[03:12:19]</a>. Google's strategy was to give away the OS for free to gain search traffic, demonstrating a different, highly profitable business model from Microsoft's traditional software sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:21">[03:15:21]</a>. This effectively "screwed" Microsoft in mobile unless they adopted Google's advertising-centric approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:32">[03:16:32]</a>.

In search, Microsoft struggled with MSN Search and Windows Live Search. A $7 billion acquisition of aQuantive for advertising technology did not go well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. In 2008, Microsoft made a bid of $47 billion to acquire Yahoo, effectively their "last Hail Mary" to gain search market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:53">[02:44:53]</a>. The deal fell through, and Microsoft later launched Bing in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:04">[02:45:04]</a>. The company's persistent focus on search was driven by the realization that advertising-based monetization could scale infinitely and generate significantly more revenue per user than traditional software licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Windows 8 and Surface: Further Consumer Disconnect

Following Windows 7 (a successful but modest release focused on stability, akin to a "Toyota Camry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:51">[03:22:51]</a>), Microsoft pursued Windows 8 with a bold vision for touch and tablets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:19">[03:24:19]</a>. The 2010 launch of the iPad "validated the product vision" for touch-first computing but also "terrified" Microsoft leadership, who feared Apple would replicate its mobile success in the PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:26">[03:25:26]</a>.

Windows 8's radical interface, featuring a "tablet tiled start screen" that subsumed the traditional desktop, confused users and alienated OEMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:32">[03:28:32]</a>. The decision to make Windows 8 a single OS across both touch tablets and traditional desktops, despite initial plans for separate versions, led to a mixed and confusing user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:41">[03:29:41]</a>. This commercial failure meant the Windows app developer ecosystem remained largely unenthusiastic, with developers flocking to web and mobile apps instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:25">[03:33:25]</a>.

This period also saw the launch of Microsoft's first-party hardware, Surface RT, in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:18">[03:28:18]</a>. The Surface RT ran on ARM processors and a new Windows 8 app platform (HTML5), but the technology was not yet mature enough for it to function effectively as both a tablet and a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:35">[03:31:35]</a>.

Internally, Microsoft's "Windows-centric" culture further exacerbated these issues. For example, Office for iPad, developed by 2013, was controversially "shelved" to avoid competing with Windows 8 and Surface devices, despite user demand for cross-platform access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:18">[03:58:18]</a>. This decision, however, was reversed shortly after Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014, signaling a shift in strategic priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:25">[03:58:25]</a>.

By 2014, Microsoft's consumer product efforts had largely failed, with the Zune, Bing (small market share), Windows Phone (lost to Android), and Windows 8 all struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:52">[03:33:52]</a>. The company's stock price had languished for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>. However, beneath the surface of these consumer challenges, Microsoft's enterprise business continued to thrive, and the foundations for its successful cloud computing platform, Azure, were being laid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:38">[03:34:38]</a>.

Michael Ovitz was considered the most powerful man in Hollywood for two decades, responsible for hundreds of movies and TV shows, including *Late Night with David Letterman*, *Jurassic Park*, *Back to the Future*, *Rain Man*, and *Goodfellas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">00:54:00</a>. His influence extended beyond Hollywood, inspiring figures like [[mark_zuckerbergs_personal_and_leadership_philosophies | Marc Andreessen]] and Ben Horowitz to similarly transform Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">01:00:00</a>.

## The Genesis of Creative Artists Agency (CAA)

Michael Ovitz co-founded Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">01:15:00</a> with four other young agents: Bill Haber, Ron Meyer, Rowland Perkins, and Mike Rosenfeld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">01:35:00</a>. The agency was born out of a philosophical disagreement at William Morris, where they felt the company was on the "wrong track" by signing older talent like Ann Miller instead of contemporary stars like Robert Redford or Dustin Hoffman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">01:46:00</a>. The firing of their mentor, Phil Weltman, further solidified their decision to leave and "do it our way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">01:56:00</a>.

Initially, CAA focused solely on television due to SAG rules ensuring weekly payments, allowing them to start their business on $100,000 and remain debt-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">02:00:00</a>. By 1978, they decided to enter the movie business, with Ovitz leading the charge in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">02:01:00</a>.

### The "Packaging" Revolution

CAA pioneered the concept of "packaging," where they would offer studios a complete package of talent (script, director, stars) rather than individual elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">02:19:00</a>. This strategy was born out of necessity, as they had few clients initially but strong relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">02:24:00</a>.

*   **Shifting Power Dynamics**: In old Hollywood, talent was under contract to studios as "paid labor," similar to NFL players in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">02:11:00</a>. Lou Wasserman, through Jimmy Stewart's *Winchester '73* deal, was the first to introduce "back-end" participation for artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">02:20:00</a>. CAA amplified this, ensuring talent participated significantly in the upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">02:27:00</a>.
*   **"Monopoly on Talent"**: Ovitz's goal was to create a "monopoly on talent" to gain leverage against distributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">02:26:00</a>. By the early 1990s, CAA represented about 45 of the 50 top-grossing directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">02:30:00</a>, making it impossible for studios to say no to their packaged deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">02:31:00</a>.
*   **The *Jurassic Park* Deal**: A prime example of packaging, Ovitz identified Michael Crichton's *Jurassic Park* manuscript and immediately targeted Steven Spielberg, an unrepresented director, to direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">00:54:00</a>. Despite the book not being published, Ovitz secured Spielberg's commitment and pre-production budgeting, then approached Universal. He famously told Universal's head, Sid Sheinberg, "sid, the bad news is you don't own it and we do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">01:42:00</a>. CAA, representing Crichton and Spielberg, negotiated a 50/50 partnership with Universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">01:07:00</a>. This deal transformed the power structure, making clients like Crichton and Spielberg receive a quarter-billion dollars from the franchise, a stark contrast to the old studio system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">01:17:00</a>.
*   **Other Noteworthy Packages**: CAA packaged successful films such as *Stripes*, *Ghostbusters*, *Gandhi*, *Twins*, *Kindergarten Cop*, *Tootsie*, *Rain Man*, *Heat* (uniting clients Al Pacino and Robert De Niro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">03:22:00</a>, and *The Untouchables* (featuring Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, and Andy Garcia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">01:18:00</a>.

## CAA's Unique Agency Dynamics and Culture

CAA's success stemmed from its distinctive operational philosophy:

*   **Team-Oriented Approach**: Unlike competitors where one agent "coveted one client," CAA assigned teams to clients, ensuring continuous support and mitigating "relationship problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">01:08:00</a>. This meant actors could have literary agents, facilitating script reading and role identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">01:09:00</a>.
*   **Client Loyalty**: Ovitz emphasized fierce loyalty to clients. For example, he diligently supported Michael Crichton through years of writer's block, taking weekly lunches to stimulate ideas and publicly claiming Crichton was working on an original project even when he wasn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">01:42:00</a>.
*   **Aggressive Talent Acquisition**: Ovitz strategically targeted major stars. After signing Sean Connery, he secured Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro, convincing them that being with CAA wasn't competition but a collective advantage, allowing for cross-collaboration on projects like *Heat* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">01:18:00</a>. He famously announced new high-profile client signings via large ads in *Variety* and *The Hollywood Reporter*, often mailing clippings to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">01:06:00</a>.
*   **Internal Communication**: In the pre-internet era, CAA developed a "buck slip" system for real-time internal communication, allowing agents to quickly share notes and updates, projecting efficiency to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">01:14:00</a>.
*   **Compensation and Incentives**: CAA paid agents "very small front money" but significantly overpaid them on the backend if the company performed well, fostering collective success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">01:11:00</a>. This allowed CAA to attract and retain top talent, as they were "minting money" due to their market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">01:13:00</a>.
*   **Mailroom Culture**: The mailroom was a crucial "fast track to a career," where new recruits learned the agency's systems and gained experience by being integrated into client teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">01:16:00</a>.

## Diversification and the Intersection of Venture Capital and Media

Ovitz continually sought to expand CAA's influence beyond traditional agency roles.

### Venturing into Advertising

Recognizing their deep understanding of audience desires, CAA, despite not being an advertising agency, secured the coveted Coca-Cola advertising account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">03:08:00</a>.

*   **Cultural Maven Strategy**: Ovitz encouraged agents to read hundreds of magazines to stay six months ahead of cultural trends, allowing them to relate to clients and understand the broader cultural landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">03:40:00</a>.
*   **The Pitch**: Ovitz identified that Coke's seven annual commercials were too generic across demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">04:07:00</a>. CAA pitched producing 30-40 diverse commercials a year for the same budget, introducing iconic elements like the Coca-Cola polar bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">04:22:00</a>.
*   **Execution and Impact**: CAA leveraged its A-list director clients, who were "between movies," to direct the commercials, paying them well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">04:45:00</a>. The launch was treated like a movie premiere, generating immense positive press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">04:53:00</a>. Notably, CAA achieved this with only six staff members compared to McCann Erickson's 300, showcasing an early form of "outsourcing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">05:12:00</a>. In one instance, Coca-Cola overpaid CAA by a factor of 100 for a commercial, thinking the initial invoice was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">05:28:00</a>.

### Strategic Financial Deal-Making

Ovitz also became a major player in corporate finance, essentially turning CAA into an investment bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">02:09:00</a>.

*   **Saving the Marketplace**: Recognizing the financial troubles of major studios (Universal, Columbia, MGM, Warner's), Ovitz feared their collapse would harm CAA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">02:11:00</a>. He partnered with investment banker Herbert Allen to bring in foreign financing, particularly from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">02:17:00</a>.
*   **Sony and Columbia Pictures**: Ovitz cultivated relationships in Japan, including with Sony's Norio Ohga and Akio Morita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">02:28:00</a>. He consulted on the sale of CBS Records to Sony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">02:41:00</a>. Later, he and Herb Allen orchestrated the sale of Columbia and TriStar to Sony, forming Sony Pictures Entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">02:51:00</a>.
*   **Matsushita and Universal**: Ovitz also advised Matsushita (Panasonic's parent company) on their acquisition of MCA/Universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">03:03:00</a>. He approached deals with Japanese companies by asking for no upfront fee, promising an "obscene sum of money" if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">02:58:00</a>. For the Matsushita deal, he received $120 million to distribute among consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">03:23:00</a>.

## Transition and Legacy

By his late 40s, Ovitz sought a new challenge, feeling he had reached the "end of my useful life as an agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">03:44:00</a>. He explored options like running a public company or going into public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">03:46:00</a>.

### The Disney Interlude and Aftermath

Ovitz eventually accepted an offer to join Disney as president, aiming to replicate CAA's culture there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">03:57:00</a>. However, his tenure was short-lived due to a "head-to-head conflict" with Michael Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">03:57:00</a>. He left Disney with a "good settlement" and took some time off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">04:44:00</a>.

### Selling CAA and a New Career Path

In a remarkable move, Ovitz sold his ownership of CAA to the next generation of partners for $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">05:08:00</a>. He provided an interest-free loan, allowing them to pay him from future profits, prioritizing the agency's continued existence over immediate payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">05:12:00</a>.

After Disney, Ovitz found a "third career" in the digital world. [[The intersection of venture capital and media | Marc Andreessen]] and Ben Horowitz invited him to their board at Loudcloud in 1999, providing a "road map to a new career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">04:49:00</a>. Ovitz found that his core skills in packaging—putting talent together with financing, marketing, and strategy—were directly transferable to the venture capital and startup world, allowing him to apply the same playbook from Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">04:51:00</a>. He continues to apply these principles, seeing himself as packaging "young founders together with money and distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">04:51:00</a>.

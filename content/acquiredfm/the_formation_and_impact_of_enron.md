The story of [[enrons_rise_and_fall | Enron]] begins with Kenneth Lay, whose journey mirrors that of other notable American entrepreneurs. Born in rural Missouri in 1942, Lay grew up in poverty, his father a Baptist preacher whose general store failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite their financial struggles, his family prioritized education, moving to Columbia, Missouri, so his older sister could attend the University of Missouri while living at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Kenneth Lay followed in her footsteps, also attending the University of Missouri, where he developed a lifelong passion for economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He excelled, earning a PhD in economics while working in the oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Ken Lay's Ascent and the Dawn of Deregulation

Lay's career took a significant turn in the mid-1970s when his former professor, newly nominated to the Federal Power Commission, invited him to Washington D.C. to assist with [[deregulation_and_its_effect_on_the_energy_industry | deregulation]] in the energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. He served as the Deputy Under Secretary of Energy in the Department of the Interior during a period of oil shocks and burgeoning [[deregulation_and_its_effect_on_the_energy_industry | deregulation]] discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

After a few years in government, Lay returned to the private sector, becoming president and number two operator at Florida Gas, a pipeline company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. By all accounts, Lay was viewed as a "real deal" â€“ a PhD economist, civil servant with DC exposure, and an industry operator who fought his way through adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Pioneering Energy Trading

In 1982, Lay moved to Houston, the "Silicon Valley of the oil and gas sector," joining Transco Energy as its president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Coinciding with his arrival, energy prices fell for the first time in a decade, creating a crisis for Transco which had contracts to buy assets at ever-increasing prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Leveraging his economics background, Lay proposed a revolutionary idea: creating a trading market for oil and gas, particularly for natural gas, which was becoming sufficiently deregulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Instead of the pipeline company acting as the direct buyer and seller, Transco would operate the pipelines and facilitate a spot market where producers and consumers could directly trade energy at real-time, appropriate prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This was a massive innovation, as prior to Lay, financialization or trading of energy barely existed due to government regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Lay became an industry legend for pioneering this approach. This early form of energy trading, while not yet securitization, opened the floodgates for future market innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. His unique blend of industry experience, economic training, and government knowledge made him the perfect person to lead this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### The Genesis of Enron

In June 1984, Lay's success led him to become CEO of Houston Natural Gas (HNG), a publicly traded energy company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The very next year, in 1985, HNG became a target for a merger proposed by InterNorth, the largest pipeline company in America, based in Omaha, Nebraska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. InterNorth, a more conservative, old-school company, sought to merge with HNG as a "poison pill" to deter the famed 1980s corporate raider Irwin Jacobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

InterNorth acquired HNG for $2.3 billion, a 40% premium to HNG's stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Despite InterNorth being the larger company, it soon became clear that Lay and the HNG team would be running the combined entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This led to a significant culture clash, particularly over the location of the new company's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. The InterNorth board wanted to keep it in Omaha, while Lay, now a "Texas Oil Man," preferred Houston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## The Arrival of Jeff Skilling and McKinsey

To justify their decision, management hired [[role_of_jeff_skilling_and_mckinsey_in_enrons_strategy | McKinsey & Company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This assignment landed on the desk of a young, "hot shot superstar Junior partner" at McKinsey's Houston office: [[role_of_jeff_skilling_and_mckinsey_in_enrons_strategy | Jeffrey Skilling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Skilling, a Baker Scholar from Harvard Business School, was known for his blunt confidence, famously telling the dean he was "effing smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Skilling's findings, presented to the board in Omaha, concluded that the company should be based in Houston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This was critical because natural gas was increasingly perceived as a "good guy" energy source, a "pseudo clean energy" and the "Tesla of the 1980s," a promising frontier for the energy business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. It benefited from being cleaner than oil, less dependent on foreign sources (unlike oil with its OPEC connotations), and possessing natural properties that made it ideal for storage and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

### A Fateful Meeting

During this pivotal board meeting in Omaha in 1985 or 1986, Lay engineered a coup, becoming the CEO of the combined company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. While the headquarters move wasn't immediately approved, this meeting marked the first encounter between Lay and Skilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Lay, ever the politician, apologized for the drama and expressed his admiration for Skilling's work, inviting him to be their dedicated [[role_of_jeff_skilling_and_mckinsey_in_enrons_strategy | McKinsey partner]] to lead future strategic initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. This marked the beginning of their collaborative relationship and the true formation of the entity that would become [[enrons_rise_and_fall | Enron]]. As the transcript states, "no headquarters study no Enron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## Future of Social and AR Technology

Social and augmented reality (AR) technology is set to reshape how we interact with the world and each other. During a recent episode of the Acquired Podcast, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, offered a detailed glimpse into how these technologies might develop in the coming years. In this article, we explore some of the key insights shared by Zuckerberg on the potential trajectory of social and AR technologies.

### Meta's Vision for Social Connection

Zuckerberg emphasizes that Meta is not just a social media company; it's a "social connection company" that uses technology to enhance human connection beyond the limitations of traditional platforms. He described a future where social interactions are not confined to a small screen but amplified through AR glasses that project holographic images into the physical world. This vision aligns with [[metas_strategy_for_future_technologies_such_as_ar_and_ai | Meta's mission]] of developing the "ideal social experience," where virtual presence and seamless interactions can be a part of everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.

### AR Glasses: The Next Computing Platform

AR glasses are seen as a crucial step toward achieving this enhanced social connection. The glasses, which are already being developed in partnership with brands like Ray-Ban, are equipped with cameras, microphones, and speakers, allowing them to effectively integrate AI functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>. These glasses are designed to be the ultimate digital social experience, merging the digital and physical realms.

### The Role of AI in AR and Social Experiences

AI plays a critical role in this evolution by providing context-aware interactions. The glasses, for instance, are envisioned to serve as "the perfect AI assistant," understanding the user's environment and providing interactive capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. As AI technology progresses, the potential for creating more personalized and immersive experiences grows, making social interactions more meaningful and dynamic. [[ai_and_machine_learning_advancements | AI advancements]] continue to shape the potential new realities that these technologies will unlock.

### A Commitment to Open Platforms

An underlying philosophy behind Meta's approach is the commitment to open platforms. Unlike Apple’s integrated model, Zuckerberg predicts a future where open systems encourage innovation and wider access. This extends to technologies like AI, with Meta releasing open-source models like LLaMA ([[the_role_of_open_source_technology_at_meta | Large Language Model Meta AI]]) to foster a more collaborative development ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:04">[02:17:04]</a>.

### Strategic Importance

Beyond the technological innovations, Meta's strategic direction reflects a desire to control its own destiny by having more influence over the hardware and software platforms that underpin its services. Zuckerberg suggests that owning the full stack—from AR glasses to the AI they run—could enhance both user experience and the company’s profitability by reducing dependence on [[comparisons_and_competition_with_other_tech_companies_like_apple_and_google | other platforms like Apple and Google]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:23">[02:03:23]</a>.

### Conclusion

The future of social technology, as envisioned by Meta, blends AR and AI to elevate human interactions beyond the screen. This transformation promises a more immersive social presence that blurs the boundaries between physical and digital realms. With its focus on open platforms, Meta aims to lead this charge by creating an ecosystem that supports broader technological innovation and community engagement. As these developments unfold, they hold the potential to redefine how we connect, interact, and perceive the world around us.

Qualcomm's financial journey during the late 1990s and early 2000s, coinciding with the dot-com bubble, illustrates a dramatic transformation in its business model and stock performance.

## Early Revenue Growth and Wall Street Perception

After Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks first went live in the US and internationally in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>, Qualcomm saw rapid revenue growth. In 1995, Qualcomm reported $383 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>, which then surged to $814 million in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:73">[01:23:73]</a>.

Despite this impressive growth, Wall Street's reception of the stock was initially negative, with the stock remaining "basically flat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:74">[01:44:74]</a> and even "kind of hates it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:62">[01:45:62]</a> until January 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:70">[01:58:70]</a>. This negative sentiment stemmed from the company's capital-intensive manufacturing operations and joint ventures, which "tying up all the profits of the company" and "punished" the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:75">[01:51:75]</a>.

## Strategic Divestments and Business Model Shift in 1999

In 1999, Qualcomm realized that its "super Capital intensive manufacturing operations" were a "serious drag on our business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:52">[02:10:52]</a>, consuming money that could otherwise be used for free cash flow or reinvestment in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:82">[02:17:82]</a>. This led to significant [[strategic_shifts_in_qualcomms_business_model_and_partnerships | strategic shifts in Qualcomm's business model]].

*   **Infrastructure Business Sale**: In March 1999, Qualcomm sold its infrastructure business (base stations) to Ericsson, a former competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:66">[02:27:66]</a>. This was part of a licensing and settlement deal arising from past lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:78">[02:37:78]</a>. Roughly a thousand Qualcomm employees transferred to Ericsson as part of this deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:52">[03:00:52]</a>.
*   **Mobile Phone Business Sale**: In December 1999, Kyocera, a Japanese company, acquired Qualcomm's mobile phone business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:91">[03:40:91]</a>.

These divestments signaled Qualcomm's strategic decision that it no longer needed to bootstrap its strategy by manufacturing its own base stations or cell phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:09">[02:50:09]</a>.

After these sales, Qualcomm officially refined its business model to two core groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:54">[03:55:54]</a>:
*   **QTC (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Group)**: Focused on selling chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:93">[03:44:93]</a>.
*   **QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing)**: Focused on licensing its extensive patent portfolio, generating "very high margin Revenue licenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:54">[04:06:54]</a>.

This new model, emphasizing high-margin semiconductor designs and patent licensing without the drag of manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:97">[04:10:97]</a>, positioned Qualcomm for explosive growth.

## Dot-Com Bubble Peak and Aftermath (Year 2000)

The year 2000, during the height of the tech bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:96">[05:40:96]</a>, saw Qualcomm's stock achieve unprecedented appreciation. As the market searched for what would "power the next generation of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:99">[05:54:99]</a>, Qualcomm became the single best-performing stock for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:34">[05:58:34]</a>.

Its stock appreciated an astounding **2621%** within the 366 days of the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:38">[06:07:38]</a>, marking a 26.2x return in the public markets in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:41">[06:23:41]</a>. However, this peak was short-lived; the stock "did not stay up there for very long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:09">[06:38:09]</a> and crashed over the next 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:02">[06:40:02]</a>, settling at "only a 4X from its pre-199 high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:05">[06:47:05]</a>.

## Post-Bubble Dominance and Future Path

Despite the post-bubble crash, Qualcomm's strategic positioning remained strong. For the next generation of cell phone networks, 3G, [[Qualcomms_early_developments_in_communication_technology | Qualcomm's CDMA technology]] largely won out globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. While there was debate between GSM and CDMA, particularly in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:94">[07:20:94]</a>, "basically all 3G was CDMA" worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:64">[07:34:64]</a>. This was because 3G prioritized data speeds, and CDMA was "the vastly superior technology" for broadband internet data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:46">[07:44:46]</a>, as it was perfectly suited for digital information packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:78">[08:04:78]</a>.

This period solidified Qualcomm's position as a dominant force in the mobile industry, leveraging its patent portfolio and high-margin chip sales, a strategy that continued to shape its [[Qualcomms_business_strategy_and_market_influence | business strategy and market influence]] for decades.

## Decline and Transformation of the Music Industry

The music industry experienced its peak in 1999, generating approximately $14-15 billion in recorded music revenues, primarily from CD sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. However, this revenue steeply declined with the advent of platforms like Napster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>. By 2009, revenues had fallen to $7 billion, as CD sales plummeted and music streaming had not yet become a significant revenue generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. The industry's all-time low for recorded revenues was in 2014 and 2015, at around $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

Despite initial declines, streaming has played a crucial role in the industry's recovery. In 2020, paid streaming subscriptions alone generated more revenue for the music industry than all formats combined in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:31">[02:28:31]</a>. The average consumer spend on music has nearly doubled with streaming, from about $45 per year on CDs in 1999 to $84 per year with streaming services averaging $7 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:02">[02:22:02]</a>. Furthermore, streaming has expanded the total addressable market (TAM) by including people of all ages, from four-year-olds to grandparents, who now pay for music subscriptions, unlike the old days when music consumption often stopped in one's twenties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:40">[02:22:40]</a>.

### Music Industry Size Compared to Other Sectors

Despite its growth, the music business remains relatively small compared to other industries. The entire recorded music industry is a $14 billion industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:37">[02:30:37]</a>, which is less than one-tenth the size of the video game industry ($170 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:46">[02:30:46]</a>. Even including tours, the total music industry is about $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:54">[02:30:54]</a>, roughly equivalent to Best Buy or American Airlines' revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:25">[02:31:25]</a>. This revenue figure is also about one-tenth of Apple's annual revenue from its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>.

## [[overview_of_music_licensing | Music Licensing]] and Royalties in the Streaming Era

When a piece of music is created, two primary copyrights come into existence:
1.  **Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording or Master)**: Traditionally owned by the record label, this copyright covers the literal recording of the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. Labels assume the financial risk of distributing and promoting an artist's work in exchange for owning these masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.
2.  **Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)**: Traditionally held by the songwriters themselves through their music publishers, this covers the written lyrics and melody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. While publishers historically took 50% of royalties, today they often take less, sometimes just a fixed fee for back-office services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

Some uses of music require approval from only one copyright owner, while others require both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

### Streaming Royalties

For a song streamed on platforms like Spotify, the vast majority of the payout (around 80%) goes to the master recording owner (the label) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>. A much smaller portion (around 12%) goes to the owner of the publishing right (typically the songwriter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.

Artists' royalty rates on master recordings tend to be 10-20% of the label's share, meaning an artist might receive 8-10% of the total streaming revenue that goes to the master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>. If an artist is also the songwriter, they would typically receive the majority of the 12% share for the publishing right, potentially adding another 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Thus, a singer-songwriter might receive about 18% of the total payout from a stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>.

The payout per stream on services like Spotify is about 0.4 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. After splits, a million streams might net about $4,000 for the artist and label combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. With a 10% royalty rate, an artist makes approximately $400 for a million streams, provided they have "recouped" their upfront advance from the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. If not recouped, the artist receives nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>. Even with a 20% royalty on higher-payout services like Apple Music (which is subscription-only), an artist might make $1,600 for a million streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the "old world" where an artist might make about $1 per CD sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.

Taylor Swift's income in 2017 highlights this dynamic: only $2.4 million of her total income came from streaming, despite her status as a top artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. U2, in the same year, made $54 million, with only $600,000 from streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.

### Traditional Radio vs. Streaming Royalties

A song played on traditional radio is considered a performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. In this model, the majority of revenue goes to the songwriter, while recording artists typically make less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>. Historically, songwriters benefited from chart-toppers, while recording artists primarily used radio play for marketing to drive CD sales, where their real money was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Synchronization Licenses

Music used in movies or commercials requires a synchronization license (sync rights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. This revenue is typically split more evenly between publishing and master rights, and both copyright owners must agree to grant the license. This gives artists, even if they don't own their masters, a veto right over how their music is used in such contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.

## Artist Advocacy and [[financial_dynamics_between_artists_and_record_labels | Label Power]]

Taylor Swift has been a vocal advocate for artists regarding streaming economics. In a 2014 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, she stated her belief that music should not be free and expressed hope that artists would realize their worth and demand fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. Her specific concern was with Spotify's free, ad-supported tier, which generated minimal royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>. She subsequently pulled her entire catalog, not just her latest album *1989*, off Spotify in November 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>.

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged challenges in communication and spent time explaining their model to Taylor's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. Taylor eventually returned to Spotify in late 2017, just before the release of her *Reputation* album <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>.

Taylor also challenged Apple Music in June 2015 when they announced a three-month free trial period during which artists would not be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>. She publicly declared, "We don't ask you for free iPhones. Please don't ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>. Within 24 hours, Apple changed its policy, agreeing to pay artists during the free trial, a rare concession for the tech giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>.

### Label Investments in Streaming Platforms

Early in Spotify's development (around 2008), the three major labels and some indie labels were offered the opportunity to buy Spotify shares at highly favorable prices. Universal Music Group (UMG) owned about 3.5% of Spotify, worth approximately $1.5 billion in capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a>.

When labels began selling their Spotify shares, there was debate about distributing proceeds to artists. Warner Music Group gave 25% of proceeds to artists but made it recoupable against future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:32">[02:00:32]</a>. Sony was more generous, offering $250 million in non-recoupable payments to artists, about a third of their stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>. In her 2018 contract negotiation with UMG, Taylor Swift reportedly forced UMG to distribute an estimated $700 million to artists as non-recoupable payments, setting a new standard for artist-favorable deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:07">[02:01:07]</a>.

## The "Taylor's Version" Strategy

The current streaming paradigm significantly enables Taylor Swift's re-recording strategy ("Taylor's Version") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:30">[02:02:30]</a>. In a world without streaming, she would have had to convince fans to re-buy physical CDs of her re-recorded albums. However, with streaming, fans can easily swap out the old versions for "Taylor's Version" in their playlists, or virtual assistants will automatically play her preferred version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a>. This ease of access encourages fans to consume her re-recorded masters, devaluing the original masters owned by Big Machine Records and Shamrock Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:51">[02:33:51]</a>.

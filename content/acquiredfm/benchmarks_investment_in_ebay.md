In June 1997, Benchmark Capital made a pivotal investment in eBay, a decision that would yield unprecedented returns and solidify the firm's reputation. This investment story is notable for its unconventional nature and the strategic foresight of [[history_and_strategy_of_benchmark_capital | Benchmark]].

## Pierre Omidyar's Early Ventures

Before eBay, founder Pierre Omidyar worked at a pen computing company called Ink, where Bruce Dunleavy, a partner at Merrell Pickard Anderson and Air, was an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Ink ultimately pivoted into e-commerce enterprise software and was sold to Microsoft, providing a positive outcome for all involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

After Ink, Omidyar joined General Magic, a company recognized for inventing concepts like cloud and mobile computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. While working full-time as an engineer at General Magic, Omidyar began "tinkering around on the early internet" in his free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This led to the creation of a collection of internet services he called eBay, short for "electronic Bay Area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Among these services, one link stood out: "auction web," which eventually became the core of eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## [[ebays_early_growth_and_monetization_strategy | eBay's Early Growth and Monetization Strategy]]

Initially, Omidyar hosted auctions for free, with "no business model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, the unexpected volume of traffic caused server costs to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This forced him to reluctantly ask users to pay a small listing fee to cover expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Users responded by deluging his apartment with checks, demonstrating clear product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

To manage the influx of payments, Omidyar brought on Jeff Skoll, a newly minted MBA from Stanford Business School, whose initial role was to "literally like open the checks and cash them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This unexpected monetization path transformed eBay from a hobby into a profitable, cash-generating business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Seeking Investment

Although eBay was profitable and generating cash flow, Omidyar, drawing on his experiences from Ink and General Magic, recognized the value of venture capitalists and a professional board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. He and Skoll pitched eBay to "everybody" on Sand Hill Road, but "literally everybody else" turned them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### [[the_role_of_benchmark_and_its_partners_in_ebays_success | Benchmark's Partnership and Investment]]

Benchmark, however, was interested. Bruce Dunleavy, remembering Omidyar from Ink, championed the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The entire Benchmark team, including Bob, David, Kevin, and Andy, collectively supported the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Benchmark offered Omidyar and Skoll a term sheet for a $6.7 million Series A financing round at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

#### The Competing Knight Ridder Offer

At the same time, eBay had a competing offer: an acquisition bid of $50 million from Knight Ridder, a major newspaper conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This offer was particularly compelling given eBay's two-person team and nascent company status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

#### The Secondary / Equity-Backed Loans: A Non-Consensus Decision

A debated but significant aspect of the deal was the provision of equity-backed loans to Omidyar and Skoll. The Washington Post reported that Benchmark structured $750,000 loans to each founder, totaling $1.5 million, to incentivize them not to accept the Knight Ridder acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Another account from a former Benchmark partner suggested that $3 million of the $6.7 million investment was used as a secondary transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Regardless of the exact figure, this decision was "highly untraditional [and] highly non-consensus" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Benchmark was "the only VC terms even the only ones willing to structure a deal like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This innovative approach allowed the entrepreneurs to take some money off the table, preventing them from selling the company prematurely and enabling a much larger future outcome for all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

#### Recruiting Meg Whitman

Crucial to eBay's post-investment success was the recruitment of Meg Whitman as CEO. Benchmark, particularly [[key_figures_in_early_benchmark_capital | David Byrne]], was "highly involved" in recruiting Whitman, a "Superstar" from Hasbro and formerly of Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Whitman's leadership helped lead the business, which Wall Street quickly embraced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## [[notable_investments_and_decisions_by_benchmark | Unbelievable Returns]]

The investment's success was rapid. eBay went public in September 1998, just over a year after Benchmark's investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. At the IPO, Benchmark's $6.7 million stake was already worth $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

However, the firm was locked up for another six months. By the time the lockup expired in spring 1999, that same stake was valued at over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This meant a $6.7 million investment from an $85 million fund generated $4 billion in a little over 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Impact on Benchmark's Fund

This single investment alone represented a "47x" return on Benchmark's fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. If the reported secondary loans were truly incremental, that would add another "one billion dollar kicker," representing an "additional 12x" on the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Benchmark distributed a confirmed $4 billion to its limited partners (LPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Even with the dot-com burst in 2000 affecting other investments, eBay's performance ensured the fund maintained an impressive mark of at least a 50x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### Carry Distribution and [[impact_of_benchmarks_equal_partnership_model | Equal Partnership Model]]

The massive success of eBay resulted in approximately $1.5 billion in "carry dollars to be distributed amongst the [[venture_capital_firm_benchmarks_unique_partnership_model | equal partnership]]" at Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Famously, pieces of this carry were also given to their assistants, leading to stories of Benchmark assistants becoming multi-millionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

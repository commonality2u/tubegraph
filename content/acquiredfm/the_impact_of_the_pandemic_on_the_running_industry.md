The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to many industries, including retail, but the running industry, particularly performance running, experienced a unique and often positive trajectory during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>.

## Initial Shock and Swift Adaptation

In early 2020, the retail sector faced immediate and widespread shutdowns. European retail closed within a week, followed by North America by the end of March, leading to frozen cash cycles across the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>. This period was described as "white knuckle time" as no one knew the lethality or transmissibility of the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.

However, companies like Brooks Running, which specialized in performance running gear, had an advantage due to their obsessive focus on runners and participation, which directly links to unit sales and volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. Unlike much of the athletic footwear industry, where products are often for casual lifestyle rather than active use, 90% of Brooks' products were designed for actual running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Running's Resilience and Growth

Brooks had a hypothesis that running would recover, based on past observations that running is "recession resistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. For example, after the Great Recession, running experienced double-digit growth in countries like Italy and Spain, even amidst 50% youth unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. This resilience stems from its accessibility: it's a cheap and convenient activity, requiring minimal equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>.

Furthermore, running proved to be "COVID-friendly" due to its outdoor nature and ability to be practiced while social distancing, unlike many other sports or gym activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.

## Tracking the Surge

Brooks actively monitored changing consumer behavior:
*   **Strava Data** Daily activity on Strava, a popular running app, showed consistent growth after quarantine shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   **Field Marketing** Brooks deployed 45 field marketing personnel in the U.S. to high-traffic running parks at 4 PM daily, where they physically counted runners, confirming the growing participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.
*   **Digital Sales** With visibility on 85% of retail sell-through, Brooks observed a dramatic shift in sales channels. Digital sales, which previously accounted for 30% of their product distribution, surged to 80% by the end of April 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>. This shift enabled Brooks to sell more in May 2020, almost entirely through digital channels, than in May 2019 across all channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.

## Supply Chain Advantage and Growth

Brooks' exclusive focus on performance running gear allowed them to turn their supply chain back on 6 to 12 weeks earlier than many broader retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. This strategic advantage, combined with their multi-channel approach and ability to manage inventory effectively, was critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.

As a result, Brooks experienced significant growth during the pandemic years:
*   27% growth in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>
*   31% growth in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>
*   Achieved over $1 billion in revenue, reaching $1.13 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

Despite the fact that running gear was not considered an essential business like alcohol or marijuana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>, the unique dynamics of the sport and Brooks' focused strategy allowed them to not only survive but thrive through the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook

The pandemic reinforced Brooks' business model, centered on "business model execution at scale" and cultivating deep partnerships with retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. Their continued focus on product quality and consumer engagement in both real-life and digital spheres positions them for sustained growth, aiming for 60 million customers and $4 billion in revenue globally in the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. The pandemic, while disruptive, ultimately underscored the enduring appeal and adaptability of running as a global activity.

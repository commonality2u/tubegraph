[[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]], formerly known as Facebook, is a company whose products are used by more humans than any other company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. As of 2024, Meta has 4 billion monthly active users and over 3 billion daily active users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. To put this in perspective, the Roman Empire at its peak was only 40% of humans, and the British Empire at its peak was 23% of the global human population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. No government, tech company, or utility has ever addressed so much of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Over 20 years since its founding, Meta has connected humanity through its apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. While the first 10 years of Facebook saw breathless exuberance over its societal benefits, the past decade has seen reporting focused on its stumbles and controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The global scale of [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] is not an accident but the result of careful actions by motivated and brilliant people dedicated to connecting as many people as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Mark Zuckerberg's Early Life and Passions

The story of [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] begins with [[mark_zuckerbergs_reflections_on_the_early_days_of_facebook | Mark Zuckerberg]], who was born in May 1984 in Dobbs Ferry, New York, as the second of four children to Karen and Ed Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. His mother is a psychologist, and his father is a dentist, who was always interested in math and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Growing up in the 90s, Mark's passions became threefold: turn-based strategy video games, programming computers, and ancient Greek and Latin classics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Early Programming & Inspirations

Mark became hooked on Sid Meier's Civilization, a 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) game, which emphasizes strategy, resource management, and multiple ways to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Playing such PC games inspired him to learn programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. At age 10, he bought "C++ for Dummies" and later had a tutor for an hour a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. He described his free time as "awesome, I have five whole hours to just sit and play on my computer and write software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This C++ learning at such a young age was impressive, as it's a language requiring deep awareness of system constraints and memory management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

As a kid, Mark coded various projects, including a family chat tool called "Zucknet" for networked computers in his home and father's dentistry office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. In 1997, at age 13, AOL launched AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), which completely changed his social experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. AIM was a rogue Skunk Works project within AOL, not originally intended for social use, but for workplace chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. AIM was free and became a viral consumer software, reaching 36 million users by 2001, including most middle and high schoolers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. AIM was also easy to hack, allowing kids to extend its functionality with graphics, emojis, and ASCII art in profiles and away messages, fostering a culture of personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Mark was among those writing programs to extend AIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

### Philips Exeter and Synapse

Mark transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy for his last two years of high school, seeking a higher level of competition and the ability to study Latin and Classics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. There, he met Adam D'Angelo, future CTO of Facebook, who also shared a passion for computers and AIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. For their senior project in 2002, they built "Synapse," an AI DJ plugin for Winamp that recommended songs based on user consumption data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Synapse gained adoption, and companies like Winamp and Microsoft offered to acquire it or hire them, an offer around $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. This experience showed Mark that his creations had value, alleviating job worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

## Harvard and Early Projects

Mark attended Harvard in Fall 2002 after scoring 1600 on his SATs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. He joined the AI fraternity there, while Adam D'Angelo went to Caltech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. During his freshman year, Adam built "Buddy Zoo," a social network that analyzed AIM buddy lists to show connections and popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. Buddy Zoo quickly gained a couple hundred thousand users, demonstrating the power of network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. This was the first time Adam, and by extension Mark, recognized the value of applications that improve as more people join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

During summer 2003, Adam interned at MIT Media Lab and discovered Friendster, a dedicated social network funded by Kleiner Perkins and Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. Friendster, though often a dating site in disguise, had over 3 million users by the end of summer 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. Adam noted how Friendster's "testimonials" feature, similar to a Facebook wall, was used to describe why someone would be a good date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. Adam posted a testimonial on Mark's Friendster profile, stating "Mark gets way too lucky," a phrase he reflected on for 20 years, noting Mark's ability to position himself for luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. Mark was constantly looking at projects like Synapse, Buddy Zoo, and Friendster, thinking about how to incorporate them to improve his own work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

In Fall 2003, Mark's sophomore year at Harvard, he lived in Kirkland House Suite H33 with Chris Hughes, Dustin Moskovitz, and Billy Olsen, three of whom would become Facebook founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Mark focused on side projects, having worked on about 10 before Face Mash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

### Course Match & Face Mash

One of Mark's early projects was "Course Match," a tool allowing students to see which friends were taking or planning to take specific classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. It took Harvard by storm as students prioritized taking classes with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. Observing the high engagement with mere lists of names, Mark sought something visually compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

This led to "Face Mash," which Mark coded in one evening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. It was a "hot or not" website for Harvard students, where users voted on which of two pictures was "hotter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. The controversial aspect was that Mark hacked into Kirkland House servers to download students' "Facebook photos" to populate the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

A "Facebook" (lowercase) was a printed book given by Ivy League and private high schools, containing names, class years, and photos of incoming students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.

Face Mash's engagement was so high it melted the Kirkland House servers, forcing Harvard IT to shut down internet access within hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. It was Mark's first rich web app built on the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. The LAMP stack made it possible to build such applications for minimal cost and without permission, as all components were free and open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>.

Harvard was displeased, and Mark faced the administrative board, narrowly avoiding expulsion but receiving disciplinary probation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. The night before the decision, his fraternity threw a "goodbye Mark party," where he reportedly met Priscilla Chan, his future wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. Despite the trouble, Face Mash made Mark a Harvard computer celebrity, known as "the guy who can make websites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

This reputation led to two upperclassmen, the Winklevoss twins, approaching Mark with their idea for "The Harvard Connection" (later "ConnectU") to digitize Harvard's Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. While this wasn't a unique idea (Harvard IT had planned it for years, and other schools had similar platforms), Mark agreed to help code their site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. However, the era of open-source web technologies meant a technical person like Mark didn't need non-technical co-founders or a CEO; he could build and launch products with product-market fit independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.

## Founding of The Facebook

During Harvard's Christmas break in 2003-2004, after visiting Silicon Valley, Mark became motivated to build his own digital Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. He envisioned incorporating elements from his previous projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. He told the Harvard Crimson, "I don't really know what the next big thing is because I don't spend my time making big things. I spend time making small things and then when the time comes I put them together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

On February 4th, 2004, Mark Zuckerberg launched "thefacebook.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. The registration page outlined its functionalities: searching for people, finding classmates (Course Match), looking up friends of friends (Buddy Zoo), and seeing a visualization of one's social network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. The site famously bore the tagline "Copyright 2004 The Facebook. A Mark Zuckerberg Production" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

Initially, Facebook didn't have messages, wall posts, pokes, events, photos (beyond profile pictures), or status updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. Registration was limited to Harvard.edu email addresses, ensuring real identities and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>. Unlike MySpace or Friendster, which allowed anyone to sign up, Facebook's exclusivity to a trusted network of classmates was a core differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

Importantly, all content was user-submitted, avoiding issues from scraping university servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Users entered their AIM screen names, cell phone numbers, interests, and classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. Displaying cell phone numbers and relationship status was common among college students and provided utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. Users could choose their own profile pictures, expressing personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.

This foundational model, with authentic identity, user-submitted content, and trust within a private network, laid the groundwork for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>. Within 24 hours, 650 people joined, and within two weeks, over half of Harvard's undergraduate population was active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. This initial network was super dense, engaged, and active, radiating outwards as Facebook expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. Unlike Friendster, which was open to everyone but often empty upon joining, Facebook provided an "unbelievably great experience" for those who could access it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>.

The fact that it started at Harvard, a top global brand among universities, gave Facebook an "elite" patina that competitors couldn't replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. As weeks went by, 70% of people who ever signed up were daily active users, an insane engagement metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. The early team, including Mark, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, coined the term "the trance" to describe how users would spend hours clicking through profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>.

### Expansion and Funding

Mark quickly added features like "the Wall" for public posts between friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. He then decided to expand to other colleges, recruiting his roommates Dustin Moskovitz (who learned PHP for the task) and Chris Hughes, plus Andrew McCollum for design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. Eduardo Saverin, a fraternity brother and business club member, invested $1,000 in infrastructure, with Mark investing another $1,000, establishing a Florida LLC with Mark holding two-thirds and Eduardo one-third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.

Mark intentionally chose to expand to Columbia, a school with an existing competitor, to immediately test Facebook's ability to displace rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. Within 22 days of Harvard's launch, Columbia's Facebook was set up as a completely separate network, with no connectivity between schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. This compartmentalized infrastructure avoided the N-squared problem of global social networks, keeping server loads manageable and page loads fast, unlike Friendster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. Mark, even at age 19, likely understood these scaling benefits alongside user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

On the same night Columbia launched, Mark attended a Bill Gates speech at Harvard, where Gates mentioned Harvard's generous leave policy as a reason he felt comfortable dropping out, which influenced Mark later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.

Facebook quickly expanded to Stanford and Yale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. By the end of the semester (3-4 months), they were in over 100 schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. They built waitlists to generate demand before launching at a new school, ensuring a dense, active network from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>.

The Winklevoss twins' dispute with Mark over "ConnectU" eventually led to a $65 million settlement, with $45 million paid in pre-IPO Facebook stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.

For Summer 2004, the Facebook crew (Mark, Dustin, Chris, Andrew) rented a house in Palo Alto to work on the project, which included a zipline off the chimney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. Eduardo Saverin did not join, staying for an internship in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>. This ultimately led to Eduardo's stake being diluted from one-third to about 2% as the company formalized into a Delaware C Corp in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Shawn Parker and Strategic Direction

While in Palo Alto, the team was also working on "Wirehog," a captive Napster-like file-sharing product for Facebook users, which they initially believed had more potential than Facebook itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.

They encountered Shawn Parker, co-founder of Napster and Plaxo (an e-contact list company that pioneered email address book exploitation for viral social network bootstrapping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. Parker, who had a bitter past with Sequoia Capital and distrusted VCs after being ousted from Plaxo, immediately recognized Facebook's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. After cold-emailing the company and having dinner with Mark and Eduardo, Parker moved into the Facebook house in Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>.

Parker advised Mark to restructure the company to ensure permanent board control, preventing VCs from taking over and replacing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. This was a radical idea for the time, as VCs typically installed their own management and controlled boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>. Parker, despite his own self-interest (becoming Facebook's president and board member), genuinely wanted to help Mark win the "game" and ensured everyone in the house received equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>.

Parker helped them find the right investors: individual angel investors who understood their terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>. He called Reed Hoffman (LinkedIn co-founder, early Friendster investor) and Mark Pincus (future Zynga founder, former boss of Parker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. They were blown away by Facebook, but Hoffman immediately told Mark to drop Wirehog and focus on Facebook, especially avoiding music due to Napster's legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>.

Hoffman connected them to Peter Thiel, who was starting Founders Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. Founders Fund was revolutionary for its "founder-friendliness," a stark contrast to the norm where VCs controlled companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:30">[01:25:30]</a>. Thiel led a $500,000 round at a $5 million pre-money valuation ($5.5 million post), with Hoffman and Pincus each investing $37,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>. This initial investment yielded an approximate 250,000X multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>.

At the end of Summer 2004, Eduardo and Chris Hughes returned to Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. Andrew McCollum later completed his degree, while Dustin Moskovitz never went back to Harvard, staying with the company until 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:54">[01:28:54]</a>. Mark likely never considered going back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>. Adam D'Angelo returned to Caltech, collaborating remotely until becoming CTO in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:55">[01:29:55]</a>. Shawn Parker's direct influence on Mark's board control became crucial for Facebook's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a>. Parker left Facebook in Spring 2005 after nine months, following drug-related charges, and joined Founders Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:28">[01:30:28]</a>.

## From "The Facebook" to Facebook

By Spring 2005, "thefacebook.com" had dropped "the" to become just "Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:45">[01:31:45]</a>. Shawn Parker negotiated the domain name purchase for $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. With growing server bills, Parker introduced Mark to Western Technology Investment (WTI), a debt fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:35">[01:32:35]</a>. WTI provided a $300,000 loan in Fall 2004 and another $300,000 in Spring 2005, with warrants that would become a "greatest venture debt deal of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:41">[01:32:41]</a>.

In Spring 2005, Accel led a $12.7 million Series A round at a $98 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:20">[01:33:20]</a>. Accel's investment was significant for the time, especially accepting Mark's board control and taking less than 20% of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>. This was the first post-.com institutional venture capital deal where the founder maintained control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>. Accel faced limited partner skepticism and withdrawals for investing in an "eyeball clicks" company at a high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[01:34:57]</a>. The shares were acquired at 4.5 cents per share, which, by 2024, yielded a 13,000X return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:47">[01:36:47]</a>.

## Product Roadmap and Growth

In Summer 2005, Mark announced a six-point product plan: a site redesign (bye-bye Facebook guy, Peter Wolf from J. Geils Band "Centerfold" album art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>), a photo application, a personalized newspaper based on friends' activity, an events feature, a local business product, and a vague "I'm bored" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>. While not all features shipped that year, Photos, Newsfeed, and Platform (the "I'm bored" feature) would transform Facebook over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>. Each of these was a standalone company idea in the "old paradigm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>.

The brilliance of [[mark_zuckerbergs_vision_for_the_future_of_meta | Mark Zuckerberg's vision for the future of Meta]] was that these features reinforced each other, driving engagement loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>. For example, events led to tagged photos, which published to Newsfeed, generating FOMO and driving more engagement and sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. Photos (launched late summer 2005) introduced photo tagging, allowing users to tag people with XY coordinates and browse profiles by tagged photos, a new concept for social networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:49">[01:42:49]</a>.

The 2005-2006 school year saw incredible growth and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>. By November 2005, Facebook received 230 million daily page views, surpassing Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>. Users were caught in an "hours-long trance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>. From 3 million users in June 2005, they reached 5 million by September 2005, a 10x increase from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:09">[01:47:09]</a>. Almost a third of all US college students were on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:23">[01:47:23]</a>. Engagement metrics were astonishing: 70% daily active, 85% weekly active, 93% monthly active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:37">[01:47:37]</a>. By October 2005, they were the 10th most visited site and were generating $1 million a month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:54">[01:47:54]</a>. They became cash flow positive in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Major Decisions

Despite core growth, Facebook's attempts to expand to high schools and workplaces in 2005-2006 largely flopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:46">[01:49:46]</a>. Workplace networks failed due to privacy concerns and lack of density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:20">[01:50:20]</a>. High schools lacked standardized email architecture, preventing elegant private networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:15">[01:51:15]</a>. High school sign-ups (on `hsf.net`) required an invite from a college student, making it a "crappy one" compared to the college version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:54">[01:51:54]</a>.

Summer 2006 was a scary moment for Facebook: college growth slowed, and expansion initiatives were struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>. Viacom offered $750 million, and Yahoo offered $1 billion to acquire the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>. Mark, with his founder control (thanks to Shawn Parker), didn't have to sell, but the rest of the management team and board likely thought they should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>. Mark initially agreed to Yahoo's $1 billion all-stock deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>. However, when Yahoo's stock dropped 20% after a bad quarter, reducing the offer to $800 million, Mark walked away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:40">[01:55:40]</a>. This decision, though initially accepted, proved correct, as Facebook's revenue would soar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:50">[01:58:50]</a>.

### Microsoft Partnership and Newsfeed

In August 2006, Facebook partnered with Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:46">[02:00:46]</a>. Microsoft agreed to sell all of Facebook's domestic display ad inventory, providing a guaranteed CPM, to bootstrap their online services division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:04">[02:01:04]</a>. This was a win-win: Microsoft gained ad inventory and market entry, while Facebook, which "sucked at selling ads," secured revenue without building its own ad sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Facebook's revenue jumped from $9 million in 2005 to $48 million in 2006 and $153 million in 2007, largely due to this partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:26">[02:02:26]</a>.

Newsfeed (launched September 5th, 2006) was a major product innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:34">[02:08:34]</a>. Before Newsfeed, Facebook was a collection of static profile pages; the homepage was uninteresting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">[02:08:42]</a>. Users would manually browse profiles for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:22">[02:09:22]</a>. Newsfeed was the "invention of the feed" on the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:47">[02:10:47]</a>. Technically, it was complex, requiring algorithms to aggregate and rank updates from friends, initially refreshing four times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:17">[02:11:17]</a>.

Newsfeed's launch was met with massive backlash: 30,000 angry emails on the first day, and 10% of the user base joined a group called "Students Against Facebook News Feed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>. Users were upset that private profile updates were pushed into a public feed, even though technically privacy settings hadn't changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:53">[02:15:53]</a>. Mark's leadership and the growth team (led by Chris Cox, Ruchi Sanghvi, and Andrew "Bos" Bosworth) saw that engagement was skyrocketing despite the complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:46">[02:17:46]</a>. Mark responded with a post titled "Calm Down. Breathe. We hear you," announcing controls for users to manage what appeared in their Newsfeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:03">[02:18:03]</a>. Within two weeks, users adapted, and engagement continued to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:05">[02:19:05]</a>.

This incident, however, unfortunately led Mark and the company to believe that users would always get used to any change, a lesson that wouldn't always hold true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:47">[02:20:47]</a>.

### [[facebooks_introduction_of_newsfeed_and_platform | Platform]] and Open Registration

Open registration, the ability for anyone to sign up for Facebook, was planned for two days after Newsfeed but was delayed due to the backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:25">[02:21:25]</a>. When it finally launched at the end of September 2006, it faced less controversy, partly because users were "desensitized" from the Newsfeed uproar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:21">[02:22:21]</a>. This marked the beginning of "oh, my mom is on Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:57">[02:21:57]</a>. Open registration worked very well, accelerating user growth from 5-10,000 users a day to 70,000 users a day by late Fall 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>.

In Spring 2007, Mark launched "Platform," previously the "I'm bored" idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:34">[02:24:34]</a>. From 2007-2011, this was seen as the core and future of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Facebook aimed to become a developer platform like Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>. F8, Facebook's first developer conference, launched the platform on May 24th, 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:14">[02:26:14]</a>. Facebook's appeal to developers was user attention (20 million users, growing by 100,000 daily) and rich user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:59">[02:26:59]</a>.

Platform allowed developers to build and run apps natively on Facebook, enabling games (like Scrabulous), quizzes, and other experiences with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:50">[02:27:50]</a>. This was a shift from digitizing offline life to providing online activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:16">[02:28:16]</a>. The internal goal was 5,000 developers in the first year; they achieved this in two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:03">[02:30:03]</a>.

However, Facebook's position as a platform was weak because it didn't control the OS or hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:51">[02:32:51]</a>. They had to offer huge distribution and extensive data access to incentivize developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:06">[02:33:06]</a>. Newsfeed's organic distribution for apps, while driving growth for developers (e.g., Zynga with Mafia Wars), led to a trade-off: bothering users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:36">[02:34:36]</a>. Facebook eventually pulled back on organic Newsfeed distribution for apps to protect the user experience, which effectively killed many apps but was the right long-term move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Developers then started buying ads on Facebook, turning Platform into another advertising revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a>.

### Microsoft Investment and Advertising

In October 2007, just five months after Platform launch, Facebook had significant leverage over Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:47">[02:40:47]</a>. Microsoft, keen to buy Facebook (having offered $24 billion earlier, which Mark turned down), settled for an expanded partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:31">[02:45:31]</a>. In a late-night negotiation, Facebook leveraged a looming meeting with Google to secure a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:32">[02:42:32]</a>. The negotiation was punctuated by a hackathon starting at midnight, organized by Javier Olivan (now COO of Meta) to begin internationalizing the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:51">[02:43:51]</a>.

The new partnership made Microsoft the worldwide exclusive third-party advertising network for all display ads on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:50">[02:44:50]</a>. Crucially, Microsoft invested $240 million in Facebook at a $15 billion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:22">[02:45:22]</a>. This was the largest private technology investment in history, far surpassing Google's IPO market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:56">[02:46:56]</a>. Microsoft's investment eventually grew to $8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:52">[02:47:52]</a>.

At this point, Mark still saw ads as "gross," prioritizing product, engineering, and [[the_strategic_importance_of_owning_platforms_at_meta | platform]]. He outsourced ad sales to Microsoft, believing the company's future was in platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:53">[02:49:53]</a>. However, Facebook was also developing its own native ad products.

### Beacon and the Birth of Growth Team

Facebook's attempt at native advertising, "Beacon" (led by Chamath Palihapitiya), launched in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. Beacon published users' e-commerce activity from third-party websites into their Newsfeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>. This was a "horrific" privacy failure, spoiling engagements (e.g., a diamond ring purchase) and confusing advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:57">[02:54:57]</a>. Facebook initially tried to apply the "Newsfeed Playbook" of giving it time and adding controls, but after weeks, they made Beacon opt-in (instead of opt-out) and eventually killed it two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:27">[02:55:27]</a>.

The Beacon fiasco led Mark to realize he needed someone who deeply understood advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:12">[02:56:12]</a>. This set the stage for Sheryl Sandberg joining Facebook in 2008 as COO. Sandberg had built and run Google's self-serve advertising business, creating the world's greatest digital advertising system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:34">[02:56:34]</a>. Her arrival prompted a re-evaluation of Facebook's business model, leading to the decision to fully embrace the advertising business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:07">[02:58:07]</a>.

After Beacon, Chamath Palihapitiya was tasked with a new role. Around 2008, user growth slowed at Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:27">[02:59:27]</a>. Chamath led the creation of the "growth team," effectively the first of its kind in the industry, combining marketing and product efforts to grow Facebook using Facebook itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:54">[02:59:54]</a>. The team, including Alex Schultz, Naomi Gleit, and Javier Olivan, was data-obsessed, identifying friction points and opportunities for user acquisition and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:13">[03:01:13]</a>.

One major initiative was internationalization through crowdsourced translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:53">[03:02:53]</a>. Users themselves translated product strings, making the product more relevant to local markets and fostering a sense of ownership among early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:57">[03:03:57]</a>. Another key growth lever was "People You May Know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:15">[03:06:15]</a>. The team discovered that a new user's engagement depended on connecting with a certain number of friends (e.g., 7 friends in 10 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:33">[03:07:33]</a>. The algorithm for suggesting "People You May Know" leveraged user data like email contacts to predict connections accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:35">[03:08:35]</a>.

Thanks to the growth team, user growth reignited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:55">[03:09:55]</a>. From just under 150 million users by the end of 2008, Facebook grew 250% in 2009 to 350 million global users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:07">[03:10:07]</a>. Daily active users as a percentage of monthly active users (DAU/MAU) also improved, from 50% in 2008 to almost 70% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:19">[03:11:19]</a>.

### The Like Button and Advertising Power

In 2009, the "Like" button, invented by FriendFeed (Brett Taylor and Paul Buchheit), was adopted by Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:52">[03:11:52]</a>. Initially considered as an "Awesome" button, Mark personally opted for "Like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:54">[03:13:54]</a>. Internal testing showed it boosted overall engagement and comments, not just acting as a replacement for comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:37">[03:14:37]</a>. The "Like" button also extended to Pages, becoming a form of "capital" for brands and an organic distribution channel before Facebook required payment for brand visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:06">[03:15:06]</a>.

The Like button became a "Trojan Horse," incentivizing third-party websites to embed Facebook's JavaScript, which in turn provided valuable data for Facebook's advertising algorithm (e.g., through cookies tracking web movement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:08">[03:16:08]</a>.

The business was on fire. Revenue grew from $153 million in 2007 to $280 million in 2008, almost $800 million in 2009, and $2 billion in 2010, making Facebook very cash flow positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:38">[03:17:38]</a>. By 2010, Facebook had 600 million users, and by 2011, 850 million users, with revenue growing to $3.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:05">[03:18:05]</a>.

## [[impact_of_mobile_on_facebook | Impact of Mobile on Facebook]]

By 2012, Facebook was preparing for its IPO, facing an existential threat from the rise of mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>.

Key challenges presented by mobile:
*   **Closed Ecosystems**: iOS and Android were proprietary, controlled by Apple and Google, unlike the open web where Facebook was born and thrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:07">[03:20:07]</a>.
*   **Platform Incompatibility**: Facebook's core "Platform" business, allowing apps to run inside Facebook, wouldn't work on mobile, as apps cannot run inside other apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:51">[03:20:51]</a>. Payments (Facebook Credits) also wouldn't work due to app store fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:39">[03:21:39]</a>.
*   **Ad Monetization Gap**: Facebook's revenue relied on right-hand column display ads on desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:31">[03:22:31]</a>. Mobile apps had no such space, and there was a cultural allergy to placing ads directly in the Newsfeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:45">[03:22:45]</a>. Facebook's S1 filing in 2012 explicitly stated they did "not currently directly generate any meaningful revenue from the use of Facebook mobile products" and that their "ability to do so successfully is unproven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:46">[03:23:46]</a>.
*   **Slow Development Cycles**: On the open web, Facebook could "move fast and break things," rapidly pushing code updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:35">[03:24:35]</a>. Mobile app updates required a two-week review and approval process by Apple and Google, with the risk of rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:51">[03:24:51]</a>.
*   **Competitive Reset**: On desktop, Facebook was dominant due to strong network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:36">[03:25:36]</a>. On mobile, Facebook was just one icon among many on the home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:56">[03:25:56]</a>. The prevailing wisdom was for narrow, specialized apps, making it easy for users to pick different apps for photos (e.g., Instagram) or messaging (e.g., WhatsApp), threatening Facebook's bundled value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## IPO and Mobile Monetization

Facebook was forced to go public because it crossed 500 shareholders by the end of 2011, requiring it to report quarterly like a public company anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:16">[03:30:16]</a>.
They also had some tailwinds:
*   **Google+ Defeat**: Facebook successfully fended off Google+, which was treated as an existential threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:40">[03:31:40]</a>. Facebook's engineering culture, with its monolithic codebase and flexible teams, enabled a company-wide lockdown to defeat Google+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:51">[03:33:51]</a>.
*   **Privacy Resolution (Temporary)**: Facebook had faced years of scrutiny for its privacy practices (e.g., apps accessing private posts, public friend lists without consent, changing private fields to public) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:37">[03:34:37]</a>. In 2011, they signed a consent decree with the FTC, promising changes and subject to audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:23">[03:35:23]</a>. This, at the time, allowed them to present a "buttoned up" privacy story for the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

On February 1st, 2012, Facebook filed its S1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:51">[03:37:51]</a>. During the quiet period, on April 9th, 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:20">[03:38:20]</a>. This was Facebook's largest acquisition to date, and they couldn't publicly discuss it beyond filing an amended S1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:40">[03:38:40]</a>. Instagram, with 27 million users and no mobile revenue, was not an immediate fix for Facebook's mobile problem but a strategic move for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:59">[03:38:59]</a>.

On May 15th, 2012, just two nights before the IPO pricing, General Motors publicly announced it was pulling all its ad spend from Facebook, citing ineffectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:45">[03:40:45]</a>.
Despite this, on May 17th, 2012, Facebook priced its IPO at $38 a share, raising $16 billion at a $104 billion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:16">[03:41:16]</a>. Trading on May 18th was volatile due to NASDAQ overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:56">[03:41:56]</a>. The stock closed barely up at $38.23 due to underwriting banks supporting the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:36">[03:42:36]</a>. Over the next five months, the stock plummeted, bottoming out at $17.68 on September 4th, 2012, a 53.5% drop from its IPO price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:10">[03:43:10]</a>. It didn't reach its IPO price again until August 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:34">[03:43:34]</a>.

At this critical juncture, [[the strategic importance of owning platforms at Meta | founder control mattered]]. Mark, with his 20-year view, could withstand the market downturn and make long-term decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:05">[03:45:05]</a>. Sheryl Sandberg stated that they "just stopped caring about the right side ads on desktop" and put "every engineering resource" on mobile, trading the present for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:51">[03:45:51]</a>. This "bet all moment" meant ads on mobile had to be good, as they would be front and center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:15">[03:47:15]</a>. This necessity led to the creation of a more valuable ad unit, as ads filled the entire screen on mobile, commanding more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:51">[03:47:51]</a>.

Mark tasked Andrew "Bos" Bosworth (his former TA, now CTO of [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]]) with leading mobile ads, even as Bos had a six-month honeymoon planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:20">[03:48:20]</a>. Bos and Will Cathcart (now head of WhatsApp) initially launched "Pages You May Like" ads in the "People You May Like" carousel as a "Band-Aid" to generate some mobile revenue before employee lockups expired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:19">[03:49:19]</a>.

Their main project, "Project Whale Shark," was to bring native ads to the Newsfeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:02">[03:51:02]</a>. They launched it at the end of 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:21">[03:51:21]</a>. Bos reduced his sabbatical to six weeks to work with Cheryl on pitching advertisers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:11">[03:52:11]</a>. Early mobile ads were "crappy," frustrating Mark, who initially pushed for fewer ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:38">[03:54:38]</a>. However, Bos argued for *more* ads, asserting that a great ad was on par with content and that a liquid marketplace with tons of ads would enable better targeting and relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:08">[03:55:08]</a>. This "only way out is through" philosophy meant pursuing massive scale for ad algorithms to function effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:09">[03:56:09]</a>.

By Q4 2013, mobile advertising constituted 53% of Facebook's revenue, and total ad revenue grew 76% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:50">[03:57:50]</a>. Desktop revenue shrank, confirming the shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:28">[03:58:28]</a>. This wild 18-month journey saved the company, as Facebook built a unique, pioneering, and defensible native mobile ad unit in the feed, defining a new generation of monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:59">[03:58:59]</a>. This led to the most captivating and engaging ad unit in history, where users are "okay" with ads filling their screens, and in some markets, engagement reportedly goes down if ads are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:20">[03:59:20]</a>.

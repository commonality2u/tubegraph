From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Plaid, known as a bank linking service that connects bank accounts to fintech apps, has experienced a tumultuous journey, notably involving a proposed acquisition by [[history_and_development_of_visa | Visa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Plaid's CEO, Zach Pereé, shared insights into the company's path through this period of high-stakes corporate drama and its subsequent growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Proposed [[history_and_development_of_visa | Visa]] Acquisition (2020)

In January 2020, [[history_and_development_of_visa | Visa]] agreed to acquire Plaid for $5.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This agreement was the culmination of several months of negotiations, with [[history_and_development_of_visa | Visa]] already being an investor in Plaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The decision to sell was described as difficult but logical at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The announcement to the Plaid team was made in an all-hands meeting, marked by a range of emotions including anger, frustration, surprise, and joy among the approximately 350 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Plaid's CEO clarified that Plaid and [[history_and_development_of_visa | Visa]] were not direct competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. While both enabled payments (bank accounts vs. credit cards), they rarely served as viable substitutes in the same transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Plaid aimed to make financial services more efficient and create new payment methods and innovation in the system, which could be seen as competitive in a meta sense with the historical financial system represented by [[history_and_development_of_visa | Visa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### DOJ [[antitrust_and_monopoly_laws | Antitrust]] Lawsuit and Deal Termination

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an [[antitrust_and_monopoly_laws | antitrust lawsuit]] to block the acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Plaid initially did not expect [[antitrust_and_monopoly_laws | antitrust]] to be an issue, given their belief that they did not compete directly with [[history_and_development_of_visa | Visa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. However, the DOJ alleged that [[history_and_development_of_visa | Visa]] was a [[impact_of_monopolies_and_antitrust | monopolist]] and that acquiring Plaid would allow them to expand their [[impact_of_monopolies_and_antitrust | monopoly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. A "second request" from the government for more information indicated serious [[antitrust_and_monopoly_laws | antitrust]] scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

During the pending acquisition, Plaid continued to operate independently and grew significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic led consumers to rely more on digital financial services, boosting Plaid's usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The "free money" environment also spurred the founding and funding of many fintech startups, all of which were Plaid customers, leading to further growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

By late 2020, Plaid's executive team began to consider walking away from the deal, as the exclusivity period was approaching its one-year lapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Although Pereé believed they would have won the [[antitrust_and_monopoly_laws | antitrust lawsuit]], it would have taken two years to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. By then, Plaid's business had grown substantially, making the initial $5.3 billion valuation less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

In January 2021, Plaid decided to terminate the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This decision was communicated in a challenging all-hands meeting, where Pereé had to explain to employees that the anticipated financial outcome from the acquisition would not materialize as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

> "The second hardest all hands that I've ever done. I go there and I'm in front of everyone and I like really practiced on on what I was going to say and how it was going to go and it went well and it was amazing. You just you look at the crowd. We probably had 350 people in this all hands almost all of them physically there and there was anger, frustration, surprise, like joy. Some people were crying." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>
>
> "January of 2021, this is the actual hardest all hands that I ever had to do. Um, and this one was over Zoom. I was in the office I think by myself and the entire company was on Zoom and I basically said, 'Hey, all of you people that thought you were going to get a bunch of money from this acquisition, we're now not going to do it.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>

The experience of the failed acquisition was akin to a conversation Pereé had with Scott Cook, founder of Intuit. Cook had advised that the best thing to happen to him was the blocked acquisition of Intuit by [[the_impact_of_antitrust_actions_on_microsoft | Microsoft]] due to [[antitrust_and_monopoly_laws | antitrust]], after which Intuit grew into a multi-hundred-billion-dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Post-Acquisition Growth and Valuation

After the deal fell through, Plaid raised a funding round in April 2021 at a valuation of $13.5 billion, significantly higher than the $5 billion [[history_and_development_of_visa | Visa]] acquisition offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This round allowed for employee secondary sales, providing some liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

More recently, in 2024, Plaid raised another round at a $6 billion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. While lower than its peak, this reflects a change in market multiples, as the business's fundamentals (growth, profitability, new products) were stronger than in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. Pereé emphasized focusing on controllable metrics and improving fundamentals, believing the market would eventually weigh the company accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

## Plaid's Evolving Business Model

Plaid's origins trace back to 2012, when co-founders Zack Pereé and William Hockey aimed to build an API for bank accounts, believing it was the "missing link" for creating great digital financial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Initially, Plaid built consumer budgeting apps, which were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. They spent 90% of their time figuring out how to get data into the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. A conversation with Venmo's head of engineering led to a pivot: Venmo wanted to license Plaid's backend data infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This marked their transition to focusing solely on the infrastructure side, making Venmo their first meaningfully sized customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

### Early Days: Screen Scraping and Legal Basis

In the early days (2012-2013), banks did not have APIs for data sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Plaid leveraged the Dodd-Frank regulations, which stated that consumers own their financial data and should be able to permission it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Since the rules for data sharing weren't yet written, Plaid built "screen scrapers" to collect consumer financial data, with legal air cover from the Dodd-Frank Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This complex process allowed them to integrate with thousands of financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. While some banks were antagonistic due to fintech stealing trading volume, many were collaborative, asking Plaid to screen scrape until they could build their own APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Today, the vast majority of Plaid's data comes from API-driven integrations with banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.

### Diversification and Analytics

Plaid has diversified beyond just bank linking, building products that rely on or are adjacent to their core service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This includes:
*   **Credit-oriented products**: Asset and income verification for loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.
*   **Identity verification**: Acquired a company to tie bank linking to verified identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   **Bank payments infrastructure**: Enabling direct bank payments for bills or account funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
*   **Analytics layer**: Building on their aggregate data to offer solutions for fraud and credit scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

This expansion has made Plaid exposed to the macro cycles of financial services, particularly interest rate fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. Their business model includes per-action fees (like user signup fees, per-payment fees) and per-user per-month fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. While new user signups declined during the fintech boom's end, other revenue streams remained stable, leading to slower, but continued, revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

The large funding round in 2021 enabled Plaid to invest heavily in engineering, replatforming their data backend to shift towards being an analytics business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. Their new products, leveraging unique aggregate data, include:
*   **Anti-fraud solutions**: Analyzing user patterns across apps and federating fraud signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
*   **Real-time credit system**: Augmenting traditional FICO scores with real-time data like job changes or spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.
*   **Payments analytics**: Improving the reliability and predictability of bank payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

These new products represented over 20% of Plaid's Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in 2024, compounding at 93% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

## Building Trust and Competitive Advantage

Plaid aims to build its brand across three key stakeholders: developers, financial institutions, and consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>. The consumer brand is particularly challenging due to Plaid's "thin user experience" as an embedded "ingredient brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. The goal is to evoke trust, clarity, and simplicity, making consumers feel that "that just worked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.

Plaid's competitive advantages are primarily **network effects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. First, their "onboarding as a service" capability ensures high user signup success rates for customers like Robinhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. Second, data network effects allow them to build unique and differentially useful products like fraud analytics and credit products, impossible for others without their aggregate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>.

Pereé also highlights **operational excellence** (which he calls a "willingness to move fast and build products faster than others") as a critical factor, even if it's not a "durable competitive advantage" in the classic sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.

## Evolution of Work and AI's Impact

Pereé believes that the nature of work, especially in software development, is undergoing a massive shift due to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. He noted that the "grinding projects" or "grinder problems" that Plaid leveraged in its early days—where pure volume of efficient work through brute force led to a better product (e.g., building 12,000 bank integrations)—are no longer a differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. Instead, the quality of decisions made by developers, product managers, and designers matters much more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. This implies increasing returns to strategy and thoughtful decisions, and decreasing returns to sheer volume of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.

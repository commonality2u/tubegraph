The fundamental idea behind all investments in equities is that they are worth the [[discounted_cash_flow_valuation | discounted value]] of their future cash flows "from here to Eternity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. For some companies, these cash flows are immediate, while for others, they are projected far into the future, but all are incorporated into the [[discounted_cash_flow_valuation | valuation]] formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Role of Future Judgments

Every company's [[discounted_cash_flow_valuation | Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)]] formula necessitates [[Qualitative_Judgments_in_Venture_Investing | judgments about the future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Even seemingly stable companies with immense consistency can be disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This requires investors to have two key skills:
1.  **Assessing Future Potential**: Understanding the [[evaluating_future_potential_of_companies | future potential of the company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
2.  **Valuation vs. Price**: Determining the company's worth compared to its selling price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Impact of Rapid Change and Disruption

The rapid pace of technological adoption has made it harder for companies to maintain durability compared to previous eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. What was once considered an impregnable business can quickly become vulnerable:

*   **Newspapers Example**: Newspapers were once thought to have great "moats" due to their localized monopolies, low cost, and daily necessity for advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. However, the dramatic [[changing_consumer_behavior_in_investment_evaluation | shift in consumer attention]] to the internet caused the industry's value to plummet, leading many companies to fight for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Predicting Shifts**: It can seem "crazy" to assert that [[changing_consumer_behavior_in_investment_evaluation | consumer behavior]] will change en masse very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For example, predicting the decline of newspapers due to an "interconnected web of servers" or the rise of TikTok over Facebook's Instagram seemed unbelievable at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Modern Business Dynamics

The world's consistent "backdrop" of the past, where "the world didn't change much," has given way to an environment where "everything changes every minute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. In 1950, one could confidently say a business would be the same in ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Today, it's very difficult to assert that a business will remain consistent without active management to further entrench its "moats," fend off competition, or continuously evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Very few businesses can thrive without skilled oversight these days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Implications for Valuation: Uncertainty vs. Opportunity

The increased uncertainty regarding the future, where disruption is more likely and moats are less permanent, raises the question: "should companies be worth less?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

This situation is a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>:
*   While companies without active management are more susceptible to disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, those with competitive advantages that continually leverage them can create significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   The ability for companies to exploit their advantages, enter adjacent markets, launch new products, or expand geographically has never been higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The internet, for instance, allows companies to address global markets, unlike past local businesses such as newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:05:04]</a>.

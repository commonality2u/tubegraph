## Precursor: Linkabit Corporation

The origins of [[founding_of_qualcomm_and_contributions_to_the_wireless_industry | Qualcomm]] trace back to Linkabit Corporation, co-founded by Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Linkabit initially developed a video scrambling system for pay TV on cable systems, which enabled two-way communications for companies like Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system solved the problem of early pay TV channels like HBO being accessible for free by technically inclined individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

In 1980, Linkabit was acquired by M/A-COM, an East Coast radio technology company, for $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16">[01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36">[01:36]</a>. The company grew significantly within M/A-COM, reaching 1,500 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56">[01:56]</a>.

Jacobs and Viterbi remained with M/A-COM for five years after the acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26">[02:26]</a>. In 1985, following a leadership change at M/A-COM, they, along with other top Linkabit engineers, decided to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29">[02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35">[02:35]</a>.

## Founding of [[founding_of_qualcomm_and_contributions_to_the_wireless_industry | Qualcomm]]

Observing the nascent cellular telephone industry, which was just beginning in 1985 with 1G analog car phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02">[03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17">[03:17]</a>, Jacobs and Viterbi recognized a massive opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45">[02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09">[10:09]</a>. Despite the high cost (thousands of dollars in early 80s dollars) and power requirements (needing a running internal combustion engine) for these car phones, consumer demand was "insane," with years-long waitlists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53">[04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07">[05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43">[04:43]</a>.

They identified that the existing analog cellular systems were inefficient, with limited bandwidth, similar to FM radio stations where frequencies couldn't be too close due to interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21">[05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51">[05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08">[06:08]</a>.

In July 1985, Jacobs, Viterbi, and five other Linkabit engineers founded a new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39">[06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42">[06:42]</a>. They named it **Qualcomm**, short for "Quality Communications," reflecting their expertise in delivering high-quality communication solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55">[06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57">[06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09">[07:09]</a>.

Recognizing the substantial capital expenditure and complex competencies required to build a cellular network (towers, base stations, phones, chips, protocols), they decided to start by offering consulting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31">[07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50">[07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27">[10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31">[10:31]</a>.

### The Breakthrough: CDMA Patent

One of [[founding_of_qualcomm_and_contributions_to_the_wireless_industry | Qualcomm]]'s first consulting projects was with Hughes on a proposal to the FCC for a mobile satellite network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35">[10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47">[10:47]</a>. While optimizing satellite communication channels, they developed an application of spread spectrum for multiple conversations to access the same channels simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13">[11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21">[11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24">[11:24]</a>. This technique was named **Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29">[11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32">[11:32]</a>.

#### Understanding CDMA

Historically, telecommunication networks used:
*   **Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA):** Where each conversation gets its own distinct frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28">[12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54">[12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57">[12:57]</a>. This is analogous to everyone having their own room in a dinner party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36">[17:36]</a>.
*   **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA):** An advancement over FDMA, especially prominent in Europe (driven by Ericsson) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51">[14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00">[15:00]</a>. With digital signals, conversations could be broken into packets and rotated through time slots on the same frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37">[13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04">[14:04]</a>. This allowed more capacity (3-5x) than analog FDMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32">[15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36">[15:36]</a>. This is like five to ten people in a room taking turns to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45">[17:45]</a>.

[[founding_of_qualcomm_and_contributions_to_the_wireless_industry | Qualcomm]]'s CDMA approach allowed all conversations to be sent simultaneously across all channels by appending a unique digital code to each conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01">[17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02">[17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03">[17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10">[17:10]</a>. The receiving device would then decode and reassemble the specific message by identifying its unique code, disregarding other signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54">[16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14">[17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00">[18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09">[19:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20">[19:20]</a>. This is likened to everyone in a room speaking in their own language, and the intended recipient understands only their language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50">[17:50]</a>.

CDMA was a significantly more efficient way to use the available spectrum, allowing for the maximum amount of conversations or signal transmission within a given medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30">[20:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07">[21:07]</a>. It also required less power for end-point devices, improving battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50">[20:50]</a>.

### The CDMA Patent and its Significance

In 1986, years before [[founding_of_qualcomm_and_contributions_to_the_wireless_industry | Qualcomm]] directly entered the cellular industry, they patented the method and technique for CDMA applied to terrestrial cellular networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52">[19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56">[19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59">[19:59]</a>. This patent, U.S. Patent number 4,901,307, became one of the most valuable patents in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08">[20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12">[20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18">[20:18]</a>. The patent established the concept of using all available frequencies for simultaneous, coded broadcasts, allowing for efficient communication regardless of power levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37">[20:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40">[20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50">[20:50]</a>.

This strategic move by [[qualcomms_history_and_strategic_maneuvers | Qualcomm]] was lauded as one of the most brilliant strategic executions in market entry, comparable to or even surpassing that of Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27">[09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33">[09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35">[09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37">[09:37]</a>.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has established itself as a global leader in the semiconductor industry through its unique business model, strategic partnerships, and robust internal strategies. Founded by Morris Chang, TSMC adopted a "Pure Play Foundry" model, focusing solely on manufacturing chips designed by other companies, thereby avoiding competition with its clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. This approach has been a cornerstone of its success, fostering deep trust and collaboration with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>.

## Founding Vision and the Fabless Model
Morris Chang foresaw the emergence of fabless companies, those that design chips but do not manufacture them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>. This vision was partly influenced by his interactions, such as with Gordon Campbell, who sought funding for a company that would not build its own fabrication plants (fabs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:29">[02:18:29]</a>. Another early interaction was with Don Valentine, who founded a company called ATM that also did not have any fabs and sought General Instrument (where Chang worked) to make wafers for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:01">[02:19:01]</a>. Chang recognized the inherent difficulty and advantage of running a foundry business: satisfying many customers who each want the fab run "their way," while gaining the advantage of having many customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:15">[02:20:15]</a>.

## [[TSMCs relationship with major clients like Nvidia and Apple | Key Client Relationships]]

### Nvidia
TSMC's long-standing partnership with [[TSMCs relationship with major clients like Nvidia and Apple | Nvidia]] began in 1997 when Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, sent a letter to Morris Chang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. At the time, Nvidia was a small, four-year-old company facing bankruptcy with only 50 or 60 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. Chang, irritated that his San Jose office had not responded to Nvidia, personally called Jensen Huang and arranged a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Huang impressed Chang with his articulateness and optimism, predicting that their new chip would save Nvidia and make them a major TSMC customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. This prediction came true; the successful game chip prevented Nvidia's bankruptcy and within two to three years, Nvidia became one of TSMC's top five biggest customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

#### Resolving the 40nm Node Problem
In 2009, TSMC faced manufacturing and quality issues with its 40 nanometer node, impacting major customers like [[TSMCs relationship with major clients like Nvidia and Apple | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Morris Chang, who had stepped down as CEO but retained the chairmanship, decided to retake the CEO position to address this and other pressing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. Upon returning, Chang called key customers, including Jensen Huang, who seriously reminded him of the ongoing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. After weeks of investigation and working out a number, Chang emailed Jensen to propose a meeting at his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:23:00">[32:23:23]</a>. At this meeting, Chang offered a settlement of over $100 million for the damages caused by the 40nm node issues, giving Nvidia 48 hours to accept to avoid arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>. Jensen accepted the offer within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>. This resolution highlights the importance of the strong personal relationship and partnership between TSMC and Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>.

### Apple
TSMC's relationship with [[TSMCs relationship with major clients like Nvidia and Apple | Apple]] began when Morris Chang's wife was informed that Terry Gou (founder and CEO of Foxconn, and her second cousin) would bring an Apple Vice President to their home for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Jeff Williams, Apple's Chief Operating Officer, directly initiated discussions about TSMC fabricating Apple's chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. This was a surprise, as Chang had thought Apple was a "closed mouth company" that would only approach suppliers when ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>.

Williams proposed a 40% gross margin for TSMC, which was less than TSMC's then-current 45% margin, but Chang decided it was not the time for a pricing discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>. Apple wanted TSMC to develop a 20nm node, which was a "half step" or "detour" from TSMC's planned progression from 28nm directly to 16nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:55">[01:50:55]</a>. At the time, TSMC's R&D resources were not strong enough to develop two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>.

Despite this, TSMC decided to invest in the 20nm node, securing funds through borrowing rather than cutting dividends or issuing new stock, after consultation with Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:55">[02:23:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>. TSMC initially offered to meet half of Apple's requested demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:28">[02:31:28]</a>. Jeff Williams accepted this, only suggesting that TSMC cut its dividends, which Chang refused to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:39">[02:31:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>.

A temporary pause in discussions occurred in February 2011 when [[TSMCs relationship with major clients like Nvidia and Apple | Intel]] approached Tim Cook to be considered as a supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:52">[02:36:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a>. However, Chang was not overly concerned, believing TSMC was at par or better than Intel in technology and manufacturing, and possessed greater customer trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Tim Cook later explained that Intel "just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:55">[02:43:55]</a>. This highlighted Intel's perceived arrogance and lack of responsiveness to customer requests compared to TSMC's service-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:07">[02:45:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:14">[02:46:14]</a>.

The tradeoff for pursuing the 20nm node for Apple was delaying TSMC's 16nm node development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:51">[02:50:51]</a>. This allowed Samsung to take an initial lead in the 16nm space, securing early orders from Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:37">[02:51:37]</a>. Despite this, Jeff Williams assured Chang that Apple would buy all their 16nm needs once TSMC was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:12">[02:54:12]</a>. Indeed, when TSMC's 16nm process became available half a year later, most of Apple's 16nm requirements were fulfilled by TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:38">[02:54:38]</a>.

## [[Technological and Business Strategies of TSMC | Business Strategies]]

### Pure-Play Foundry Model
[[TSMCs founding and Morris Changs vision | Morris Chang's]] core insight was to create a pure-play foundry that did not compete with its customers, unlike integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. This strategy, though initially driven by what TSMC *could* win at rather than what would be most valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:34">[02:23:34]</a>, proved to be a genius move, allowing TSMC to serve a wide range of fabless companies without conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>.

### R&D Investment and Capital Expenditures
A key strategy for [[Technological and Business Strategies of TSMC | TSMC's technological leadership]] was Morris Chang's decision in 2009 to fix the R&D budget at 8% of revenue, regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:26">[02:41:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">[02:42:04]</a>. This provided stability and assurance to the R&D team, propelling innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:09">[02:44:09]</a>.

In 2010, Chang made a significant bet by tripling capital expenditures to almost $6 billion to go "all in" on the 28nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:01">[02:43:01]</a>. The R&D team called the 28nm node the "Sweet Spot," a term that signified its strategic importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:05">[02:44:05]</a>. This decision faced questions from the board, who felt it was "betting a huge amount of the company's cash on this node" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:01">[02:49:01]</a>. However, Chang, leveraging inputs from market forecasts, R&D, and business development, convinced the board to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:12">[02:50:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>. This aggressive investment coincided with the smartphone era, leading to immense demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:10">[02:51:10]</a>.

### [[TSMC pricing strategy | Pricing Strategy]] and the Learning Curve
TSMC's pricing strategy is deeply rooted in the "learning curve" theory, which Morris Chang helped refine at Texas Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:29">[02:02:29]</a>. The theory posits that as a company produces more of a product, its unit cost decreases due to gained experience and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>. This strategy aims to achieve the largest volume in the market to drive down costs, even if it means initially operating at lower margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>.

To mitigate the risk of customers over-ordering capacity without commitment, TSMC instituted a policy of requiring deposits from customers, with the threat to "confiscate" the deposit if wafers were not taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:52">[02:25:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:37">[02:26:37]</a>. While actual confiscation never occurred, this policy ensured customer commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:35">[02:27:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:52">[02:29:52]</a>.

### Organizational Structure and Talent Management
Upon returning as CEO in 2009, Chang combined the previously split "advanced technology" and "mainstream technology" operational groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:48">[02:52:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:22">[02:59:22]</a>. He also centralized the business development function, viewing it as a strategic marketing department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:03">[02:59:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:10">[02:59:10]</a>. This role was crucial for finding next-generation businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:51">[03:00:51]</a>. He offered the business development role to C. C. Wei (the current chairman and CEO of TSMC), who accepted despite it being a smaller department in terms of direct reports, allowing him to gain marketing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:28">[03:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:26">[03:06:26]</a>.

Chang also had a distinct philosophy on talent management, particularly regarding layoffs. In 2008-2009, during a financial crisis, the previous CEO laid off 600-700 employees based on "poor performance review," which Chang considered a "knee-jerk reaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. Chang's policy was to rarely fire people, instead placing them on probation or transferring them to more suitable roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>. Upon his return, the laid-off employees protested at his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>. Chang reinstated the policy of not laying off based on performance reviews, and eventually, most of the laid-off employees were rehired or found other roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:13">[02:09:13]</a>.

## [[The impact of technological advancements on TSMCs growth | Impact of Strategies]] and Global Dominance
TSMC's commitment to continuous R&D investment and aggressive capital expenditures, especially on leading-edge nodes like 28nm and later 7nm, allowed it to outpace competitors and achieve [[Technological and Business Strategies of TSMC | technology leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:05">[02:44:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:53">[02:46:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This leadership, combined with its pure-play model, has made TSMC indispensable in [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | global supply chains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:02">[02:27:02]</a>. The rise of ARM architecture also provided a critical window for TSMC to become a dedicated foundry for ARM-based chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:02">[02:25:02]</a>.

The company's growth is also deeply intertwined with the Hsinchu Science Park ecosystem in Taiwan, which includes TSMC's partners, customers (like Qualcomm and MediaTek), and two universities that feed talent directly into the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:45">[02:47:45]</a>. This physical co-location facilitates extremely close communication and integration among key players in the semiconductor value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:03">[02:29:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>. The Science Park is regarded as one of the most successful government-funded industry initiatives in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:06">[02:31:06]</a>.

Morris Chang's long-term vision, combined with the power of [[The impact of technological advancements on TSMCs growth | Moore's Law]] and globalization, allowed TSMC to become the dominant player in semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:14">[02:11:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:20">[02:11:20]</a>. The industry's natural monopoly characteristics, driven by the escalating costs of building new fabs and R&D, reinforce the lead of companies like TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:54">[02:41:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:16">[02:42:16]</a>. As a result, TSMC has grown significantly, riding a "ridiculous Tailwind" in the semiconductor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

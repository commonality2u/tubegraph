[[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] has faced numerous challenges throughout its history, from fierce competition in the [[retailing | retail]] sector to the complexities of global expansion and the rise of e-commerce.

## Competition
Historically, [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s business philosophy was intensely focused on its competitors, aiming to observe their successes and adapt those strategies to its own operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.

### Kmart
When [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] launched in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:35">[01:21:35]</a>, Kmart, a new discounting concept from the existing S.S. Kresge variety store chain, was the dominant player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:04">[01:29:04]</a>. Within five years, Kmart had 250 stores and $800 million in sales, dwarfing [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s $10 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>. Kmart leveraged its existing distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>, but these were not tailored to the new discount model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>.

By the early 1990s, Kmart began to feel the squeeze from [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s nationwide expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:09">[01:52:09]</a>. In the mid-to-late 1980s, Kmart engaged in a "drunken acquisition spree," acquiring companies like Sports Authority, OfficeMax, Builder Square, Waldenbooks, and Borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:05">[01:53:05]</a>. This strategy ultimately failed, and Kmart started selling off these acquisitions to raise cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Kmart filed for bankruptcy in January 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:07">[01:54:07]</a> and merged with Sears in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:14">[01:54:14]</a>, a combined entity that itself went bankrupt in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>. The introduction of [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] Supercenters, which included groceries, was described as the "death knell" for Kmart, especially as their own "Super Kmarts" concept failed due to [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s superior distribution strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:02">[02:01:02]</a>.

### [[Amazons strategy and challenges | Amazon]] and E-commerce
[[Walmarts technology adoption and ecommerce strategy | Walmart]] was slow to adapt to the internet, not taking it seriously at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:13">[02:02:13]</a>. They didn't view it as an existential threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:31">[02:02:31]</a> and didn't initially pursue the online opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>. This contrasts with their historical motivation by opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:55">[02:02:55]</a>.

To bolster their e-commerce team, [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] acquired Kosmix for $300 million in 2011, which became [[Walmarts technology adoption and ecommerce strategy | Walmart]] Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:27">[02:03:27]</a>. In 2016, they purchased Jet.com for $3.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:43">[02:04:43]</a>. Although Jet.com itself was shut down, it served as a vehicle to acquire talented e-commerce engineers and product people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:43">[02:05:43]</a>. Doug McMillan, [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s current CEO, credits Mark Lore (Jet.com founder) with jumpstarting their e-commerce business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:56">[02:05:56]</a>.

However, e-commerce remains a challenge. In 2019, [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s e-commerce grew by 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>, significantly faster than [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s overall 2% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:11">[02:06:11]</a>. Despite this growth, e-commerce revenue, which accounted for about 13% of total revenue ($75 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:20">[02:06:20]</a>, is still not a profitable segment for [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:55">[02:35:55]</a>.

[[Amazons strategy and challenges | Amazon]]'s e-commerce business is five to six times larger than [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:34">[02:06:34]</a>. [[Amazons strategy and challenges | Amazon]] also possesses more advanced technology for search, utilizing metadata and user-generated content, which [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s system currently lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>. The sheer volume of SKUs on [[Amazons strategy and challenges | Amazon]]'s marketplace also presents a challenge for [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:44">[02:10:44]</a>.

### Costco and Sam's Club
[[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s membership-based [[Sam Waltons retail innovations and business philosophies | Sam Walton]]'s Clubs, started in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:50]</a>, have been successful, but are losing to Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:08">[02:19:08]</a>. Costco operates on even lower gross profit margins (around 13%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:40">[02:20:40]</a> compared to [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:15">[02:18:15]</a>, by offering fewer in-store amenities and larger quantities, appealing to customers seeking the absolute lowest price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:04">[02:21:04]</a>. Sam's Club, despite having [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s advantages, has not become dominant in the membership club category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:31">[02:19:31]</a>. One in three U.S. households had a Sam's Club membership in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:07">[02:20:07]</a>, but this has since declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:15">[02:20:15]</a>. In recent years, [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] has closed many Sam's Clubs, converting some real estate into e-commerce distribution centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:44">[02:36:44]</a>.

### Dollar Stores and Grocery Chains
The proliferation of Family Dollar and Dollar General stores presents another challenge, serving a different customer base, particularly in "food desert" locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:31">[02:34:31]</a>. These businesses have done tremendously well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:42">[02:34:42]</a>.

While [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] is the largest grocer in the U.S. today, with over 20% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a>, traditional grocery chains like Kroger (under 10%) and Albertsons/Costco (5% each) remain stiff competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:35">[01:59:35]</a>.

## Globalization and International Expansion
[[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] is a global empire, operating in 24 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18">[02:17:18]</a>, but its international expansion has seen mixed results. While they have had success stories in Mexico and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:29">[02:22:29]</a>, they have also experienced significant losses in Europe.

### Europe
[[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] pulled out of Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:36">[02:23:36]</a> and in the UK, they bought the large retailer Asda for about $10 billion in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:40">[02:22:40]</a>. While Asda was a decent-sized player, it never surpassed competitors like Tesco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:54">[02:22:54]</a>. [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] attempted to sell Asda to Sainsbury's for $10 billion, but the deal was blocked by the UK government. They eventually sold it to private equity for about $6 billion a couple of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:09">[02:23:09]</a>, resulting in a neutral at best outcome.

### India and Flipkart
In 2018, [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce company, for over $16 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:24">[02:23:24]</a>. This was seen as a way to enter the Indian market, which [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] had long sought to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:40">[02:23:40]</a>. However, this venture has not gone "super well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:57">[02:23:57]</a>, with only about 20 to 30 [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]-owned physical locations existing in India to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:04">[02:24:04]</a>.

## Other Challenges
[[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s growth rate has steadily declined since 1982, from 40-50% annually to about 3% since 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:21">[02:24:21]</a>. This slowing growth, despite its massive scale, presents a challenge for continued expansion. While [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] benefits from being considered "recession resistant" due to its low-price focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:01">[02:33:01]</a>, its overall top-line revenue is not growing rapidly.

The company's immense size, employing 2.3 million people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>, leads to inherent complexities across various facets of its operations, including labor relations, environmental impact, and social issues like gun sales. While [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] has made efforts to address environmental concerns and evolve its gun sales policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:51">[02:53:51]</a>, managing the diverse impacts of such a massive entity remains an ongoing challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:06">[02:44:06]</a>.

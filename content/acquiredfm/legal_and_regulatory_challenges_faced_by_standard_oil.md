At the time of Standard Oil's rise, industrial capitalism in America was "raw and new," and "the rules of the game were unwritten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Standard Oil]] effectively "wrote the rules" that would later become standard business practices, which subsequently led Congress to write rules *about* them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## Unwritten Rules and Early Legal Loopholes

Early in the 1800s, America was still young, predating the Civil War, Texas, and California, and corporate law was in its infancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. Companies could not own property or operate outside their own states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. The ability to incorporate a business freely was a recent development, but national corporations were not yet a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>.

To circumvent these limitations and consolidate the industry nationwide, Flagler devised an innovative financial and corporate law structure: the joint stock company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. This structure allowed Standard Oil to buy and hold shares in other joint stock companies across different states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. On January 10, 1870, the partnership was abolished, and all assets were poured into the new [[History of Standard Oil | Standard Oil Company]] of Ohio, capitalized with a million dollars in liquid assets, an unprecedented amount for an American enterprise at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>.

### The Trust System

To overcome the interstate commerce issue, Standard Oil implemented the "trust" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. The trust would hold shares in companies across the country, allowing trustees to manage these corporations, which were legally situated within their own states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. Dividends from all controlled companies flowed to the individual shareholders of Standard Oil of Ohio, bypassing the company itself to avoid legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>. This innovation in corporate structure is considered the birth of the modern American economic corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.

### The South Improvement Company

A significant early challenge came from the arrangement with railroads. Standard Oil, through Flagler, negotiated a secret agreement with the three largest railroads (Pennsylvania, New York Central, and Erie Railroads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. They set up a shell corporation called the South Improvement Company (SIC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.

The deal fixed high shipping prices for all oil producers but offered a 50% discount to SIC members (primarily Standard Oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>. More egregiously, SIC members would receive a "drawback" or kickback from the revenue generated by non-member oil producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>. This meant competitors were literally paying Standard Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:20">[01:26:20]</a>.

The agreement was kept informal, with no written documentation, to avoid scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>. When asked in federal depositions, [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] claimed no involvement in the "Southern Improvement Company," leveraging the misnaming of the entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

News of the SIC deal spread, causing "literal rioting in the streets in Titusville" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>. Public opinion began to turn against Standard Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. Although the railroads initially hesitated, Standard Oil used the threat of the SIC to coerce Cleveland refiners into selling their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>. In six weeks (February to April 1872), Standard Oil acquired 22 of 26 refineries in Cleveland, an event known as the "Cleveland Massacre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:47">[01:31:47]</a>. Ultimately, not a single barrel was shipped under the SIC agreement, as its existence alone provided the leverage needed for acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>.

## Public Scrutiny and the Sherman Antitrust Act

By 1877, Standard Oil controlled 90% of the oil business in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:12">[01:33:12]</a>. While consumers benefited from continuously upgraded products and lower costs, competitors, suppliers (railroads, pipelines), and retailers felt the squeeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a>. Standard Oil's aggressive tactics, including threatening to open competing grocery stores if retailers didn't exclusively sell their kerosene, further inflamed public sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:49">[01:46:49]</a>.

The public, fueled by long-standing American skepticism of monopolies and centralized power, became increasingly concerned about Standard Oil's "octopus" reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:57">[01:57:57]</a>.

In 1889, Ohio Senator John Sherman, whose campaign had been supported by [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] himself, proposed an "anti-trust bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">[01:52:52]</a>. The Sherman Antitrust Act passed in July 1890, outlawing "all trusts and business combinations... in restraint of trade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:32">[01:53:32]</a>. However, the term "in restraint of trade" was undefined, leading Standard Oil and Rockefeller to initially view the act as a win, believing it would appease the public without genuinely curtailing their power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:05">[01:54:05]</a>. Rockefeller even continued to be a major donor to Senator Sherman's re-election campaign in 1891 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:27">[01:54:27]</a>.

Despite its passing, it would take another 21 years for the Sherman Antitrust Act to actually bring down Standard Oil, marking the beginning of the end for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>. The long-term [[legacy_and_breakup_of_standard_oil | impact of the dissolution]] of Standard Oil, and the subsequent formation of major oil companies like Exxon, Mobil, and Chevron, would continue to shape the industry for over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:58">[02:21:58]</a>.

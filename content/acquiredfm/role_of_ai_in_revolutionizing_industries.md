Artificial intelligence (AI) is at a critical juncture, fundamentally reshaping how technology is built and used across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This shift marks a new paradigm, often referred to as "software 2.0," where the creation of technology moves from writing millions of lines of code to training models using datasets and [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | building AI applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## AI as the New Technological Paradigm

AI is not merely enhancing existing capabilities but is also unlocking entirely new ones that were previously impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
It is enabling:
*   New forms of search capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Development of social networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   The potential for super-intelligence and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), leading to concepts once only thought of in science fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The technology is rapidly catching up to use cases, leading to the emergence of "a million new things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This represents a significant leverage for builders, allowing them to create a richness of applications astonishingly quickly, an improvement that is "another 10x" on previous software paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

### The Evolution of AI Development Platforms
Hugging Face, for instance, has become the leading platform for [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI builders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It functions similarly to GitHub, but for AI models, datasets, and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Over 5 million [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI builders]] use the platform daily, sharing over 3 million models, datasets, and apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This includes well-known models like LLaMA 3.1, Stable Diffusion for images, and Whisper for audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The platform also facilitates collaboration, allowing large teams to build AI together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Open vs. Closed Source AI and Its [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_and_open_source_on_modern_businesses | Impact on Modern Businesses]]

The debate between open and closed-source AI is often misleading, as open-source principles form the foundation of all AI development, even for closed-source companies like [[impact_of_ai_development_and_the_potential_future_of_openai | OpenAI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. Historically, much of the research, such as the development of Transformers and BERT, was publicly shared, accelerating progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. However, in recent years, the field has become less open, partly due to commercial considerations and "misleading arguments around the safety of openness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

### The Role of Openness
Openness is crucial for science and enables everyone to build and understand AI systems with greater transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. It is believed that a decentralized AGI, with access to technology for private companies, policymakers, non-profits, and civil society, creates a much safer future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

Openness also empowers thousands of new [[development_of_ai_startups_and_business_models | AI companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. This shift could redistribute influence, enabling a new generation of companies to play a larger role in aligning societal challenges with technological solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

## The Future of AI Companies and Investment

The [[development_of_ai_startups_and_business_models | development of AI startups and business models]] is fundamentally different from traditional software companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.
*   **Capital Intensity:** Some foundational model companies, particularly those dealing with large language models (LLMs) like Mistral and [[impact_of_ai_development_and_the_potential_future_of_openai | OpenAI]], require significant capital for compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. However, this is primarily for text-based models, and there's potential for foundational models in other modalities like video, biology, chemistry, audio, and image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.
*   **Founding Teams:** AI startups often require founders with a strong science background rather than just traditional software engineering expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.
*   **Development Cycles:** Unlike agile software development, training and optimizing AI models can take months rather than days, requiring a different approach to shipping and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. This means traditional "Lean Startup" playbooks may no longer apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.

It's believed that all tech companies will eventually become AI companies, building and fine-tuning their own models optimized for specific use cases, constraints, and domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. This leads to a future where there are as many models as code repositories today, with smaller, more efficient, and cheaper specialized models dominating many applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. For example, a banking customer support chatbot doesn't need the generalist capabilities of a large language model and can be more efficient if trained on relevant data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.

## Growing the Pool of AI Builders

To fully realize AI's potential, the number of [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI builders]] needs to increase significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. Currently, there are estimated to be around 5 million [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI builders]] globally, compared to approximately 50 million software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>. The beauty of AI is that it has a lower barrier to entry for contribution compared to traditional software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>. Individuals can contribute expertise or data to improve models without needing to write programming code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. This expanded participation could lead to more inclusive products and the ability to solve a broader range of social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

AI is seen as "the opportunity of the century" to shake things up, challenge monopolies, and foster innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

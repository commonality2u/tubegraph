## The Genesis of a New Model: Fairness and Equal Partnership

The formation of new venture capital firms, particularly in the mid-1990s Silicon Valley, was often influenced by internal disagreements over economics and fairness within established firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. A 1995 New York Times article highlighted instances of firms splitting due to senior partners not dividing "rewards more equitably" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This environment fostered resentment among younger partners who felt that the power and financial benefits were unfairly concentrated with the older generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

One prominent figure advocating for change was Robert Cagle, then a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI). Cagle believed that the power in venture capital should be "much more distributed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> and that no single individual should claim to be making all the money for the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Cagle's conviction stemmed from his own challenging background, having grown up in Flint, Michigan, with a single mother, in a family that worked on General Motors' production lines during tough economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. He was the first in his family to attend college, at General Motors University, before ultimately reaching Stanford Business School and joining TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

After a successful decade at TVI, contributing to significant investments like Synopsis, Avant, and Viosoft, Cagle felt the senior partners were "holding on to the keys to the firm and all the economics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. He developed "an almost religious fervor" that anything other than an equal partnership was "morally wrong" for a venture capital firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This belief was rooted in a deep sense of fairness and the idea of "proper rewards for proper work," coupled with the economic reality that he was performing significant work without proportional compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Overcoming Internal Disagreements and Building a New Firm

The internal discussions at TVI regarding an equal partnership model could not reach a resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Ultimately, the senior partners decided to "declare victory" after their significant success with the Microsoft investment, effectively ending TVI as a new fund-raising entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This closure left Cagle to pursue his vision elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Dave Marquardt, another key figure from TVI, went on to found August Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, sharing offices at 2480 Sand Hill Road, highlighting the concentrated nature of the venture capital industry at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Marquardt's investment philosophy at TVI also mirrored future principles of Benchmark, emphasizing that "the venture business is an intensely personal relationship business and it's not an industry that scales well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. He believed that companies should build their own value-added services, and that venture capitalists are there to "support and be steady," with the CEO ultimately responsible for all decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This hands-off yet supportive approach would become a hallmark of Benchmark.

Cagle's initial strategy for forming a new firm centered on recruiting like-minded partners. In early 1994, he approached Bruce Dunleavy, a younger partner at Merrill Pickard, with the idea of starting a new firm based on equal partnership and focused on the emerging internet opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Dunleavy, who had interned for Cagle at Boston Consulting Group, was a promising "Young Turk" at Merrill Pickard, known for his investment in Palm Pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. However, Dunleavy initially hesitated due to not having the financial safety net of Cagle's Microsoft success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

A few months later, internal discussions at Merrill Pickard also began to explore the "equal economics idea," leading Bruce and his colleague Andy Ratcliffe to realize their firm wouldn't adopt such a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This aligned them with Cagle's vision. Cagle's decision to ask Dunleavy, his former subordinate, to be an "equal partner" demonstrated an "incredible amount of maturity" and Cagle's "obsessive sense of fairness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, along with an "absurd amount of self-confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Building the Founding Team and Setting the Benchmark

Dunleavy, while amenable to starting a new firm, recognized the need for more investment capacity and diversification than just two partners could provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Venture investing, in their view, required significant board involvement (8-10 board seats per person, no investments without board seats), which meant two people couldn't adequately cover a portfolio for diversification or credibility with Limited Partners (LPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

Their efforts to recruit other experienced General Partners (GPs) in Silicon Valley were met with skepticism, as most considered them "freaking nuts" for leaving established firms and pursuing an equal partnership model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. The prevailing ambition for young partners was to ascend within existing firms, like John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Facing a situation where their "back was against the wall," with no option to return to their old firms, they were forced to make their new venture work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

They successfully recruited Andy Ratcliffe from Merrill Pickard, bringing the core team to three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Bruce Dunleavy then suggested recruiting outside the traditional venture capital sphere, proposing to bring in "entrepreneurial DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This led to the recruitment of Kevin Harvey, a former entrepreneur who had founded two companies, one acquired by Apple and another, Approach Software, in which Dunleavy had invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Harvey saw the opportunity as "way easier than starting another company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

With Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, and Kevin Harvey, the core "four well-known founders of Benchmark" were assembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. However, they aimed for five partners for a viable firm and recruited Val Vaden, who had also attended GSB and worked in venture, but had transitioned to software company buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

By the end of 1994, with their five founding partners (Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, Kevin Harvey, and Val Vaden), they prepared to raise their first fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. The name they chose, "Benchmark Capital," was audacious and deliberately signaled their aspirations to "set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry and how venture capital is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. This name, alongside their commitment to an equal partnership model where current General Partners (GPs) own the management company without paying for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, was a bold statement to the market about their unique approach to [[venture_capital_dynamics_and_firm_structure | venture capital structure]] and [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | investing principles]].

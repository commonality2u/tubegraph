Amazon's journey from a retail business to a major technology company involved a significant shift in its underlying infrastructure, with Linux playing a pivotal role in this evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Debunking the "Excess Capacity" Myth

One common, yet untrue, origin story for [[amazon_web_services_aws_history_and_origin_stories | Amazon Web Services (AWS)]] suggests that Amazon decided to rent out its "excess capacity" during non-peak seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This narrative posits that because [[amazons_seasonal_traffic_and_it_capacity | Amazon's retail business]] was highly seasonal, with huge spikes in demand during Q4 for the holiday shopping season, they built out IT infrastructure for this peak and had it sitting idle for the rest of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The idea was to turn a large expense into a revenue stream by renting this capacity to other developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

However, this story is a myth for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>:
*   **Technical Impossibility**: In the pre-cloud era, technology companies did not operate in a way that allowed for easily renting out idle servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Servers were highly customized and tightly coupled to specific applications, with no built-in security for multi-tenancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Amazon.com's codebase was directly installed on physical boxes they owned, which could not simply be rented out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Customer Service Logistics**: If Amazon were to serve AWS customers on "excess capacity," they would have to deny service during Q4 when the retail business needed the servers, which is not a viable business model for a critical service like streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Official Confirmation**: Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon at the time (now CTO of all Amazon), stated in 2011 that the excess capacity story is a myth. He clarified that AWS was always considered a business in itself, with the expectation to grow as large as the retail operation, and would have burned through any "excess" capacity within two months of launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Linux as a Catalyst for Change

Before Linux, Amazon's infrastructure relied on expensive, monolithic systems like DEC Alpha servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. These were high-margin, bundled hardware/software platforms leased from manufacturers, akin to the business models of IBM or Oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. These systems boasted gross margins of 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

The advent of Linux fundamentally changed this landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. It enabled companies to perform tasks that previously required expensive Unix workstations on an open-source operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This meant companies could acquire different hardware, install Linux, and then develop their own applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

This shift laid the groundwork for making infrastructure significantly less expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The profit pools from infrastructure, previously monopolized by companies like DEC, Oracle, or IBM, began to disperse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Amazon's Strategic Embrace of Linux

In 2000, Amazon was in a precarious financial position, almost going out of business due to tight cash flow and high infrastructure spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The strategic decision to move to the open-source ecosystem, undertaking a massive rewrite of Amazon.com to run on Linux and HP servers (rather than DEC), was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This cost-saving measure effectively saved the company during a financially challenging period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

It is important to note that this shift to Linux and HP servers was a fundamental change in their infrastructure setup, moving away from monolithic systems to a more open and flexible environment. However, it was distinct from the development of virtualized cloud servers that form the basis of [[awss_approach_to_cloud_computing_and_technology_strategy | AWS's approach to cloud computing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Amazon never viewed technology as merely a cost center; instead, they consistently saw it as an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This mindset, combined with the capabilities unlocked by Linux, allowed Amazon to strategically position itself in an emerging market and build a new, intentional business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The transition to Linux was not an accidental byproduct of excess capacity but a deliberate and strategic move that was foundational to [[amazons_transition_to_a_technology_company | Amazon's transition to a technology company]] and its future success.

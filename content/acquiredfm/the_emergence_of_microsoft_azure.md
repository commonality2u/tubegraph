The emergence of [[Microsoft]] Azure represents a significant shift in [[Microsoft]]'s business strategy, moving from a focus on software licenses to a service-based model. This transformation was a response to evolving technology trends and internal strategic shifts within the company.

## The Vision of Services Computing

By the mid-2000s, as [[Bill Gates]] prepared for his full-time retirement from [[Microsoft]] to focus on the foundation, a successor for his Chief Software Architect role was sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:36">[03:35:36]</a>. [[Microsoft]] recognized the need for a leader to define its future technology play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:40">[03:37:40]</a>.

[[Ray Azzie]], known for authoring Lotus Notes, was identified as a key figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:06">[03:36:06]</a>. [[Microsoft]] acquired his new startup, Groove Networks, to bring him into the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:18">[03:37:18]</a>. In June 2006, [[Ray Azzie]] was named [[Bill Gates]]'s successor as Chief Software Architect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:32">[03:37:32]</a>.

In October 2005, [[Ray Azzie]] authored "The Internet Services Disruption Memo," articulating a new vision for [[Microsoft]]'s future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:01">[03:38:01]</a>:
> "The environment has changed yet again. This time around, services computing and communication technologies have dramatically and progressively improved to enable the viability of a services-based model. The ubiquity of broadband and wireless networking has changed how people interact, and they're increasingly drawn toward the simplicity of services and service-enabled software that just works. Businesses are increasingly considering what services-based economics of scale might do to help them reduce infrastructure costs or deploy solutions as needed and on a subscription basis." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:07">[03:38:07]</a>

## Founding and Early Development

With [[Steve Ballmer]]'s full blessing, [[Ray Azzie]] began recruiting for a secret project codenamed "Red Dog" in January 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:19">[03:39:19]</a>. This project was incubated outside existing divisions, a crucial decision due to the disruptive nature of cloud services to [[Microsoft]]'s established [[microsofts_enterprise_transformation | Windows Server]] and tools business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:28">[03:39:28]</a>. The traditional model involved selling solutions for on-premises operation through partners like Accenture and value-added resellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:14">[03:40:14]</a>. A cloud strategy would directly threaten these relationships and the licensing revenue model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:41">[03:40:41]</a>.

### Key Talent and Technical Foundations

To build Azure, [[Ray Azzie]] brought in top engineering talent:
*   **[[Dave Cutler]]**: A legendary engineer and the architect of [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | Windows]] NT, [[Dave Cutler]] built a new hypervisor from scratch for Azure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:01">[03:42:01]</a>.
*   **Amitabh Srivastava**: Another engineer with experience in both Enterprise server products and the [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | Windows]] development, including Vista's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:19">[03:42:19]</a>.

The technical ingredients for Azure were already present within [[Microsoft]] through various projects:
*   **Bing**: Taught [[Microsoft]] how to handle distributed systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:10">[03:52:10]</a>.
*   **Xbox Live**: Provided experience with a real-time, zero-latency, always-on cloud service with 40 million subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:10">[03:52:10]</a>.
*   **MSN**: A high-traffic web property with 750 million registered users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:53">[03:52:53]</a>.
*   **Hotmail**: A web application supporting hundreds of millions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:58">[03:52:58]</a>.
*   **SharePoint and Exchange**: Demonstrated knowledge of server-based application software for the Enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:02">[03:53:02]</a>.
*   **[[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | Windows]] Server**: Provided the technical chops for hardcore server OS development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:15">[03:53:15]</a>.

## Leadership and Strategic Commitment

[[Steve Ballmer]]'s support was critical to Azure's development. Despite heavy internal pressure from [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | Windows]] teams and partners, and the financial incentives tied to [[Microsoft]]'s existing go-to-market model, he realized the future of enterprise computing lay in the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:13">[03:43:13]</a>. This commitment involved investing billions of dollars in capital expenditure to build data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:44">[03:43:44]</a>.

While Azure initially launched as "[[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | Windows]] Azure" focused on Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and running [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | Windows Server]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:01">[03:46:01]</a>, the company's long-term goal was to become a comprehensive Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider, eventually embracing open source, a significant cultural shift for [[Microsoft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:51">[03:45:51]</a>.

In 2010, as [[Ray Azzie]] left the company, he and [[Steve Ballmer]] integrated the "Red Dog" project (renamed Azure) back into the server and tools business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:30">[03:46:30]</a>. [[Steve Ballmer]] publicly declared [[Microsoft]] was "all in" on cloud and Azure at the University of Washington, sending a clear message internally about the future direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:46">[03:46:46]</a>. He then replaced the division head of the server and tools division, handpicking [[Satya Nadella]] from Bing to lead this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:53">[03:47:53]</a>.

## Impact and Legacy

Azure's success has been profound. Today, "Intelligent Cloud," the segment containing Azure, is by far the largest segment in [[Microsoft]] by both revenue and profit, and the fastest-growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:02">[03:49:02]</a>. In fiscal 2023, Intelligent Cloud generated $88 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:28">[03:49:28]</a>.

While [[Satya Nadella]] is widely credited for Azure's success and [[Microsoft]]'s transformation to a "cloud-first, mobile-first" company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:49">[03:59:49]</a>, the foundational vision and championing of Azure during its initial seven years within [[Microsoft]] largely falls to [[Steve Ballmer]] and [[Ray Azzie]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>. [[Steve Ballmer]]'s strategic decision to promote [[Satya Nadella]] to lead the cloud transition further cemented Azure's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:20">[03:54:20]</a>.

Azure's hybrid cloud strategy, leveraging existing relationships with enterprises and their on-premise [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | Windows Server]] installations, provided a competitive advantage against rivals like [[AWS and cloud services strategies | AWS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:04">[03:50:04]</a>. The cloud market's immense growth, powering almost all digital and increasingly offline services, has made Azure an inevitable and substantial contributor to [[Microsoft]]'s continued growth, turbocharging even newer waves like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:39">[03:51:39]</a>.

[[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]] faces a "very complicated situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> due to both political and technological factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Geopolitical Risks
The primary long-term risk for [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]] is geopolitical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The core of [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]]'s model, which emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, new equipment integration, and accommodating many customers, relies on having all its engineering in one location: Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This concentration inherently carries geopolitical risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

From [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]]'s perspective, this risk is a reality that cannot be hedged against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. While [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]] is building Fabs in the U.S. and Japan, these decisions are largely for political reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, aimed at keeping the U.S. on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> and aligning with Japan as a future ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Despite these expansions, the company must "double down on Taiwan and roll the dice that nothing happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, as the "China risk" is not considered hedgeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

China is actively closing the gap in trailing-edge chip manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. They have an economic rationale and motivation to build up their capabilities, as many of these chips are manufactured for products already made in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This is because countries "don't just jump to the Leading Edge," but rather "build their way up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The fundamental reality remains that [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]] is Taiwan, and this geopolitical connection will always be its biggest risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Technological Hurdles
Beyond politics, [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]] faces the challenge of Moore's Law "running out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. EUV technology has an estimated five to six years of advancement left, and the path forward for further miniaturization beyond that is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. While there is visibility to sub-one nanometer technology, achieving such small scales (approaching two atoms wide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> is extremely challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

In response, [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]] is likely investing heavily in advanced packaging technologies, such as multiple chips on a single package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This approach, exemplified by AMD, will be crucial for future innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Another area of strategic interest is the trailing-edge market. [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]]'s investment in 28-nanometer Fabs in Japan is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, as China is making significant progress in this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Traditionally, there's little economic incentive to build new trailing-edge Fabs because the value comes from long-depreciated fabs selling cheaper chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. However, the increasing demand for chips in various applications, not all of which require the leading edge, could make this market more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The economics of this sector are "very difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, which is why China is filling the gap, as it aligns with their economic and manufacturing goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

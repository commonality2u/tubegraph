The purpose of copyright law is to spur innovation and creativity, a principle applicable across intellectual property types including copyrights, trademarks, and patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This underlying purpose influences how [[music_copyrights_and_recording_rights | music copyrights]] are structured and how artists engage with record labels and publishers.

When a piece of music is created, two primary copyrights come into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:

1.  **The Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording/Master)**: This copyright applies to the literal recording of the music as captured in a studio and heard by the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Traditionally, this is owned by the [[role_of_record_labels and_music_publishers | record label]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Labels assume ownership of these masters in exchange for taking on the financial risk of betting on, distributing, and promoting an artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **The Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)**: This covers the written lyrics and melody of a song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It can be thought of as the "idea" of the song, like something that could be put down on sheet music, before it's actually played and recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. These rights are traditionally held by the songwriters themselves, often through [[role_of_record_labels and_music_publishers | music publishers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Economic Splits and Advances

Historically, [[role_of_record_labels and_music_publishers | music publishers]] would take 50% of the royalties generated from the composition copyright, with the songwriter retaining the other 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Today, publishers generally take less, with larger songwriters potentially paying a fixed fee to the publisher for back-office services, effectively meaning the songwriter owns their own musical composition copyrights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This 50/50 split was considered very favorable for artists compared to the [[economic_split_between_artists_and_labels | splits with labels]] on the master side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

When an artist signs a distribution deal with a [[role_of_record_labels and_music_publishers | record label]] that fronts the money to make an album, the label gains ownership of the master recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The artist's royalty stream, while independently negotiated, typically ranges from 10% to 15%, and for very big artists, might reach 20% to 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The vast majority of the economics from the master recording go to the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### The Recoupment Model

A crucial aspect of these contracts is the concept of **recoupment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Artists only begin to participate in revenues generated from their music *after* they have recouped the advance provided by the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

> "If a record label signs a deal with you and they give you 500,000 well it doesn't matter if your CDs are flying off the shelves or your you know Spotify streams are happening for the first 500,000 that should be paid out to you the record labels are gonna keep that and you only get to participate in your 10 15 whatever it is after you've recouped the advance." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>

This structure is likened to a "VC preference stack on a cap table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, where the investor (label) gets their initial investment back before the artist sees a significant share of profits.

### Historical Context and Evolution

This "byzantine" system stems from a different era when it was very costly to make an album, and even more expensive to promote it on radio and distribute it widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. While often perceived as a predatory deal, this model was necessary because most artists would fail, and the labels (or book publishers, or VCs) would have sunk significant money into ventures that wouldn't succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The [[economic_split_between_artists_and_labels | economic split]] was designed so that the profits from successful artists could more than compensate for the losses incurred from those who didn't recoup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

However, it is noted that this dynamic has "completely changed" in the modern era, particularly with the [[changes_in_music_publishing_and_licensing_over_time | evolution of the music industry]] where artists can build an audience before requiring significant upfront investment from labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

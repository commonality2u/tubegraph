From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Benchmark Capital is a venture capital firm known for its unique structure and strategic approach, often contrasting with other firms in the industry. Their model emphasizes an equal partnership, deep commitment to founders, and a focused early-stage investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

## The Benchmark Dinner Tradition

A core element of Benchmark's culture is its long-standing dinner tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. The idea for these dinners originated around 2006-2007, inspired by Ben Franklin's habit of deep-dive discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:47">[07:11:47]</a>.

### Purpose and Atmosphere
The dinners are designed to foster social connection that is "fluid, fun, and playful," rather than transactional or rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. They have "no agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, encouraging open-ended discussions and wild explorations of topics the partners are curious about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:02">[08:58:02]</a>. The goal is to nurture curiosity, which is seen as the "essential lifeblood of the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:02">[08:40:02]</a>.

### The Non-Hierarchical Table
A significant aspect of the dinner tradition is the custom-designed table, created by Ole Lundberg based on a hand sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:01">[10:06:01]</a>. This organic table, which can expand and collapse, was specifically designed to "deconstruct power centers" and create a non-hierarchical, intimate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:01">[09:57:01]</a>. It ensures that all conversations are "one conversation," preventing sidebars and promoting collective engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:19">[11:17:19]</a>.

## Partnership Philosophy

Benchmark operates on an equal partnership model, contrasting with many venture capital firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This model aims to foster a strong sense of teamwork and collective responsibility.

### No Memos, No Pre-Selling
Unlike many firms that require partners to write investment memos, Benchmark does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. Memos are viewed as a "crutch" that can introduce bias, allow partners to fill in blanks, and serve as a "pre-sell" artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. Instead, the focus is on "truth seeking," where partners relay discoveries and notes from calls without ego or overarching bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. This approach encourages open discussion and allows the partners to fully experience the founder's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.

### Collective Engagement and Trust
The firm's operations, including Monday discussions, prioritize an "unbounded agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>, allowing partners to delve deeply into topics without being rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>. This fosters a collaborative environment where stories and wisdom are shared fluidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. The culture is built on the premise that "all the stories that are told at Benchmark are all about the group going and accomplishing something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>, emphasizing collective effort over individual heroics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>. A vital aspect of the [[the_culture_and_dynamics_of_venture_capital_partnerships|founder-Benchmark partner relationship]] is vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>.

## [[Venture capital investment strategies|Investment Strategy]] and Focus

Benchmark's strategy is characterized by a deep commitment to early-stage investing and a deliberate refusal to expand into later-stage "growth funds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:57:00">[41:57:00]</a>.

### No Growth Funds
Unlike many competitors who have become "life cycle Capital providers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:00">[42:00:00]</a>, Benchmark views this as a distraction. They believe that raising more money for later stages would lower their returns and "inflame" the partnership by introducing conflicting incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:30:00">[47:30:00]</a>. Their focus is on achieving high multiples on their funds (e.g., 20x, 50x, 100x), which they believe is diluted by late-stage investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[47:17:00]</a>.

The core reason for this focus is that the partners "love working with founders" at the earliest stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:05:00">[45:05:00]</a>. This passion means they don't want to spend time managing larger staffs, doing marketing for LPs, or evaluating investments outside their purview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:27:00">[45:27:27]</a>.

> "Focus is when in some ways every bone in your body thinks an idea is a really good idea but you don't do it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:28:00">[48:28:00]</a>

This focus allows them to maximize the probability of meeting and partnering with the next iconic company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

### Founder-Centric Support
Benchmark emphasizes "commitment" over making "bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>. This commitment means being "on the field denting those odds" alongside founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>. They prioritize supporting the founder and empowering them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[35:51:00]</a>. An example shared illustrates a partner flying internationally last-minute to support a portfolio company during a critical emotional decision, simply by being present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>.

This approach creates a symbiotic relationship where Benchmark's lack of a growth fund avoids conflicts of interest, allowing founders to optimize valuations for future rounds without pressure from their early investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:31:00">[57:31:00]</a>.

### "Good Failures"
Benchmark embraces the idea of "good failures," like Webvan, which they consider a "really good failure" and an investment they would make "a thousand times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. They believe that even if a company doesn't succeed financially, it can still be a worthwhile endeavor and a good use of venture capital, provided it's a "worthwhile Endeavor an entrepreneur pursuing that should get funded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. This shows a tolerance for high-risk, potentially "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>, investments based on deep conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

## [[Venture capital strategies and firm architecture|Firm Architecture]] and Evolution

Benchmark maintains a small team, typically five partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, who are all generalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:57">[01:39:57]</a>. They intentionally avoid developing specialized "swimlanes" or rigid sector focuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:43">[01:51:43]</a>.

### Partner Recruitment
New partners are typically brought in after extensively working together on boards or competing for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>. The process is organic, focusing on individuals who embody Benchmark's values and show a deep love for the craft of venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>. They seek individuals who are "roving curious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a> and aspiring to be wide dynamic range investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">[01:41:36]</a>. The firm evolves naturally with the market and entrepreneurs leading the way, rather than through intentional hiring for specific sector expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>.

### Flexibility in Roles: "Principals" and "EIRs"
Despite their commitment to an equal partnership, Benchmark sometimes employs roles like "Principals" or "EIRs" (Entrepreneurs in Residence). This is explained as a way to "surround ourselves with a person who we want amongst us all who pushes us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>. They don't have a formal "principal program" but rather find ways to work with "special people" who embody their values and are at a different stage in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>. These arrangements are often "experiments" or "trials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>, allowing for organic development and flexibility in how they engage with talented individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>.

## Ethos and Culture

Benchmark's core ethos is built on a "deep commitment to equality" that permeates everything they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:27">[01:54:27]</a>.

### Anti-Incumbent and Constant Rejuvenation
The firm operates with an "anti-authoritarian" and "destroy the incumbent" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. They do not want to become the incumbent themselves and embrace "violent rejuvenation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, which includes partners "firing themselves" when they feel they can no longer give more to the firm than they take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This ensures the firm remains fresh and focused on "collective joy in serving entrepreneurs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Humility and Accessibility
Partners consciously avoid arrogance and maintain a flat hierarchy, even booking their own meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:42">[01:54:42]</a>. They are "highly available to meet" and "quite responsive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. They believe the best introduction to a company is an entrepreneur telling another founder that Benchmark provides a "gold plated, high-quality experience" that helps "stretch their thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>.

### Gut-Driven, Not Analytical
Benchmark describes its investment process as "very like gut driven" rather than analytical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. They don't perform extensive outcome scenario analyses or rely on traditional metrics like viral coefficients in the early stages, as these can often lead to the "wrong way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. Instead, they seek a deep connection with founders who "see something that other people don't see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. The commitment comes from instinct, emotion, and the belief that the company serves a great purpose, with financial returns being the outcome, not the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.

## [[The role of venture capital and its challenges|Relationship with Past Partners]]

Former Benchmark partners become "LPs" (Limited Partners) in the firm, maintaining an official financial relationship similar to other investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Emotionally, they are seen as "uncles and aunts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a> rather than parents or overlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. They are deeply invested in the current partners' success, offering their network and insights when called upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. There is also a belief that the firm's model endures partly because former GPs become the new LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

Amazon's approach to machine learning (ML) within AWS is a strategic pillar of its business, though it is considered less critical than compute but more important than databases for customer stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Amazon's Machine Learning Offerings

AWS has significantly invested in its ML capabilities, announcing [[SageMaker and custom ML offerings | SageMaker]] and dedicating a custom ML keynote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. They provide a range of [[Amazons cloudhosted ML services | cloud-hosted ML offerings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Interestingly, AWS supports TensorFlow, a framework originally created by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For container services, Amazon offers its own custom ECS (Amazon Container Service) while also providing an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to cater to customer demand for Kubernetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Strategic Importance of Data Proximity

While Amazon's ML capabilities need to be robust, they don't necessarily need to surpass Google's in every aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The core of [[Amazons machine learning strategy | Amazon's machine learning strategy]] revolves around data proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

> [!info] Data Gravity
> The strategy dictates that users will utilize the ML services available where their data resides, as running machine learning near the data is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If a customer has chosen Amazon as their storage vendor and migrated their data to AWS data centers, they are unlikely to seek ML services elsewhere; instead, they will run their ML workloads on AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Competitive Positioning

This strategic advantage means that while Amazon cannot afford to fall significantly behind in ML capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, Google's superior ML offerings may not translate into a market advantage if customers do not store their data on Google's cloud platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This highlights a key differentiator in the [[Competitive landscape of cloud services AWS vs Microsoft Azure vs Google Cloud | competitive landscape of cloud services]].

The year 2022 brought significant personal milestones and reflections for the hosts of the Acquired podcast, Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, alongside the continued [[growth_and_evolution_of_the_acquired_podcast | evolution of the show]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Ben's Marriage

Ben experienced a major life event by getting married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>. He reflected that while he initially thought marriage wouldn't feel different after a long-term partnership, there was a profound shift in perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:09">[01:27:09]</a>. The daily reminder of the ring and the sense of longevity created a "totally different psychological place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>. The wedding process itself was described as a "transformational period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>.

The wedding was held at Ben's new house in Seattle, just after he moved in, avoiding the busy 2022 venue market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>. David served as a groomsman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Ben recalled the day as the "happiest day of my life," filled with overwhelming energy and love from friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>.

> Getting married fundamentally changes one's notion of self, expanding it to include another person whose emotions must be accounted for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>.

Ben also took a spectacular vacation to Italy for the first time, visiting Rome, Cinque Terre, Florence, and the island of Capri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. He was deeply impressed by the sense of history, especially in Rome, where ancient pillars date back thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>.

## David's Journey with Parenthood

For David, 2022 was largely about [[impact_of_parenthood_on_personal_and_professional_life | adjusting to life as a parent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:15">[01:47:15]</a>. His daughter was born at the end of 2021, and the initial months were a "fog of War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:38">[01:47:38]</a>. With his wife, Jenny, returning to in-person work, the year involved renegotiating their relationship after 16 years together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Parenting Insights
> Parenthood introduces a profound shift where one must constantly prioritize the child's well-being, as they are incapable of self-preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>. The love for a child is unfathomable, even for those who experience "instant love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:42">[01:50:42]</a>. As children grow and develop personality, it becomes "so fun" and less physically demanding than the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>.

Despite the challenges of parenthood, David and Jenny intentionally maintained their travel habits, taking eight or nine trips with their baby in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. This included a family trip to Portugal for the Solana Breakpoint conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:54">[01:51:54]</a>. They also made the decision to stay in San Francisco, settling in the same neighborhood and planning to remain in the city for the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:36">[01:52:36]</a>. David found that raising a child in the city has been "actually great," allowing for walking rather than driving and providing an environment their daughter enjoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:56">[01:52:56]</a>.

## Evolving Personalities and Priorities

Both hosts reflected on personal growth and the impact of experience on their individual approaches:

*   **David's Embrace of Trade-offs:** David noted his shift from believing "you can do everything" to embracing [[strategies_for_cultivating_meaningful_relationships | trade-offs]] as he's gotten older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>. This extends to his personal life, where he sets clear boundaries for work hours, partly influenced by parenthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:06">[01:45:06]</a>.
*   **Ben's "Persnickety" Nature:** Ben acknowledged his "Persnickety" nature, constantly seeing ways to improve things and focusing on flaws even in successful projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:29">[01:43:29]</a>. He feels this trait has intensified over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:15">[01:44:15]</a>.
*   **Balancing Work and Life:** The demands of their business as "small business owners" mean they are constantly engaged, even during personal travel, as there are daily tasks only they can handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:03">[01:33:03]</a>. Ben also noted he no longer serves on multiple company boards due to these demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:51">[01:58:51]</a>.

## Personal Technology & Media Consumption

Both hosts also discussed their personal technology choices and media consumption habits:

*   **Ben's Apple Lineup:** Ben uses an iPad Mini (perfect for live events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:23">[01:31:23]</a>, a 16-inch MacBook Pro (his "finest computer ever owned" for its power and display) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:49">[01:31:49]</a>, an iPhone 13 Mini (preferred for its size and weight despite wishing for a 14 Pro Mini) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:42">[01:34:42]</a>, and an Apple Watch Ultra (praised for its lightness, battery life, and clear screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:56">[01:37:56]</a>.
*   **David's Apple Lineup:** David still uses an M1 MacBook Air from 2020, finding it still offers "tons of head" in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. He is currently using an iPhone 12 Mini but plans to upgrade to a 14 Pro due to the camera's importance for capturing moments as a new parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[01:35:52]</a>. He also uses an original Apple Watch SE and a Kindle Oasis for reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:47">[01:42:47]</a>.
*   **Media Habits:** Ben dedicated much of his audio time to podcasts or audiobooks, primarily for Acquired research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:42">[02:07:42]</a>. David almost exclusively uses audiobooks for acquired research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:57">[02:07:57]</a>. Ben also discovered Olivia Rodrigo's music this year, as his baby enjoyed her songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:56">[02:08:56]</a>.

Overall, 2022 was a year of significant personal milestones and continued growth for the Acquired hosts, shaping their perspectives and priorities both inside and outside of the podcast.

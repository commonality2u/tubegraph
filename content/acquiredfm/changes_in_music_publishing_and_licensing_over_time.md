The core purpose of copyright law is to spur innovation and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This principle applies across various forms of intellectual property, including music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Understanding how music licensing works is key to grasping the historical and evolving business models in the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Two Music Copyrights

When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:

1.  **The Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording)**
    This copyright, often called a "master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, pertains to the literal recording of the music as it was captured in the studio and can be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Traditionally, the record label owns this copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This ownership was historically exchanged for the label assuming the financial risk of promoting, distributing, and betting on the artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This model resembles the early venture capital industry, where investors took a majority stake in exchange for funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

2.  **The Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)**
    This copyright covers the underlying written lyrics and melody—the "idea" of the song that could be put on sheet music, distinct from its recorded execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. These rights are traditionally held by the songwriters themselves, often managed through [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | music publishers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Licensing Requirements

Some uses of music require approval from only one of these copyright holders, while others require approval from both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. In cases requiring both, both the owner of the sound recording master and the owner of the publishing right have a veto over the use of the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The income splits generated from these uses can vary wildly depending on the specific application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Evolution of Roles and Financial Splits

### Role of [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | Music Publishers]]

[[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | Music publishers]] historically dealt with composition copyrights in a similar way that record labels handled master recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Historically, publishers would take 50% of the royalties from composition copyrights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, this has significantly changed; today, publishers take much less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For major songwriters, the publisher might only receive a fixed fee for administrative "back office" tasks, meaning the songwriter largely retains ownership of their musical composition copyrights and the right to license them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

#### Historical Power of Publishers

Before the era of recorded music, when publishing rights (sheet music) were the dominant rights, publishers held immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. As singers and songwriters were often different individuals, artists and record labels were entirely at the mercy of publishers who controlled the sheet music rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Co-writing Credits

Songwriting credits can be split in any privately negotiated manner between co-writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This means multiple co-writers may need to sign off for certain publishing licenses, and the financial flow can be unique—ranging from 50/50 splits to 90/10, or even flat fees, depending on the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### [[economic_split_between_artists_and_labels | Economic Splits]] and [[advances_and_recoupment_in_music_contracts | Recoupment]]

The [[economic_split_between_artists_and_labels | economic split between artists and labels]] on the master side has traditionally been far less favorable to artists than the splits on the publishing side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. When an artist signs a distribution deal where a record label fronts money to make an album and then owns the master, the artist's royalty stream is typically only 10-15%, or perhaps 20-22% for very prominent artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The vast majority of these economics flow to the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

A critical aspect of these deals is [[advances_and_recoupment_in_music_contracts | recoupment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Artists only begin to participate in revenues after the upfront advance provided by the label has been recouped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. For example, if a label provides a $500,000 advance, the label will keep the first $500,000 generated from sales or streams before the artist receives their 10-15% share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This system is comparable to a VC preference stack on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

#### Rationale for Traditional Deals

These seemingly "predatory" deals were structured to account for the high costs and significant failure rates inherent in the traditional music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. In the past, it was extremely expensive to produce an album, promote it on radio, establish distribution, and acquire fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Most artists would not succeed, meaning record labels would sink significant capital into projects that would fail to generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The economic split allowed the successful artists to generate enough profit to offset the losses from the many who did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This model, while historical, is now recognized as being "from a different era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> and is understood to be completely changed in the modern music landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

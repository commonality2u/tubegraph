Benchmark Capital's investment in eBay stands as a seminal moment in venture capital history, characterized by an unconventional approach that defied contemporary norms and yielded extraordinary returns.

## Early Days of eBay and Pierre Omidyar

eBay originated as a side project by engineer Pierre Omidyar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Omidyar had previously worked at Ink, a pen computing company that pivoted to early e-commerce software and was eventually acquired by Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Bruce Dunleavy, a partner at Merrell Pickard Anderson and Air, was an investor in Ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Following Ink, Omidyar worked at General Magic, a company recognized for pioneering concepts like cloud and mobile computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

While still a full-time employee at General Magic, Omidyar began developing "eBay" (short for Electronic Bay Area) in his free time, initially as a collection of internet services including "AuctionWeb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. [[ebays_growth_and_initial_business_model | The early iteration of eBay]] was basic, using a courier font, but its "AuctionWeb" component quickly gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Initially, Omidyar hosted auctions for free, but rapidly increasing server costs forced him to reluctantly introduce a small listing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Users famously sent checks to his apartment, inundating him with mailâ€”a clear signal of product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. To manage this influx, Omidyar brought in Jeff Skoll, a Stanford Business School MBA, whose initial role was to open and cash these checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The necessity of covering server costs prevented eBay from becoming a non-profit resource like Wikipedia, instead transforming it into a leading tech company for a generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Seeking Investment and the Competing Offer

Despite eBay's profitability and strong cash flow, Omidyar recognized the value of professional venture capitalists and a seasoned board, drawing from his experiences at Ink and General Magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Alongside Jeff Skoll, Omidyar pitched eBay to numerous venture capital firms on Sand Hill Road, but nearly all of them rejected the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Benchmark, however, expressed interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Bruce Dunleavy remembered Omidyar from the Ink days, and his partners Bob and David were keen on consumer-focused investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The entire Benchmark team collaborated, offering Pierre and Jeff a Series A term sheet for $6.7 million at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Crucially, eBay had a competing offer: an acquisition bid from Knight Ridder, a major newspaper conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Knight Ridder offered Omidyar and Skoll $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This was a significant sum, especially for a two-person company that was barely formalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. At this juncture, eBay was experiencing rapid growth of 10% month-over-month and was already profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. [[the_decision_between_selling_ebay_or_growing_it_independently | The decision between selling eBay or continuing to build it independently]] was substantial.

## Benchmark's Unconventional Strategy: The Secondary Loan

A key, debated aspect of Benchmark's [[investment_strategies_and_stock_picking_in_tech | investment strategy]] was the inclusion of an equity-backed loan to the founders. While the $6.7 million investment was made into the company, some reports suggest that a portion of this was structured to provide direct liquidity to Omidyar and Skoll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Debate on Secondary Loans
> There is ongoing debate about the exact nature and amount of secondary transactions or loans within the deal. Some sources suggest that $750,000 was loaned to both Pierre Omidyar and Jeff Skoll each, totaling $1.5 million, as an incentive to decline Knight Ridder's acquisition offer and continue growing eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Other accounts suggest as much as half of the $6.7 million round ($3 million) was used for a secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. While the specifics remain contested, it is generally accepted that some form of financial arrangement was made to allow the founders to take money off the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

This type of "secondary" transaction, where founders receive personal liquidity as part of a venture round, was highly untraditional and non-consensus at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Benchmark was virtually the only VC firm willing to structure such a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This strategy aimed to alleviate the pressure on entrepreneurs to sell their companies early for substantial but potentially limited gains, allowing them to pursue much larger outcomes.

## The Ripening of the Investment: IPO and Returns

The deal was finalized in the summer of 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Benchmark, particularly David Byrne, was deeply involved in recruiting a strong management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. A critical step was bringing in [[meg_whitmans_leadership_and_ebays_ipo_success | Meg Whitman]] from Hasbro (and previously Disney and Bain) to serve as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

In September 1998, just over a year after Benchmark's investment, eBay went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. At the time of the IPO, Benchmark's $6.7 million stake was valued at $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. However, Benchmark's shares were subject to a six-month lockup period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. By the time the lockup expired in the spring of 1999, the value of their stake had surged to over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

This single investment, from an $85 million fund, turned $6.7 million into $4 billion in less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This represented a 47x return on their fund (or 92x at the peak of the dot-com run-up before the burst) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This phenomenal success allowed Benchmark to distribute $4 billion in real returns to its limited partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The immense profit meant that even the traditional "1x back to LPs" before general partners participated in carry was a mere "rounding error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. This outcome generated over $1.5 billion in carry dollars for Benchmark's partners, and famously, even some of their assistants received pieces of carry, becoming multi-millionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

The eBay investment became a textbook example of successful [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | venture capital investment strategy]], highlighting the potential for significant returns when backing high-growth companies with visionary leadership, even if it requires unconventional deal structures.

Peloton, a company that has seen dramatic shifts in its business trajectory, recently underwent significant [[financial_and_leadership_changes_at_peloton | financial and leadership changes]] amidst a challenging market environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>. The company, known for its connected fitness products, announced a major restructuring in February 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>.

## Founding and Early Vision (Pre-2012)

The narrative of Peloton is deeply intertwined with the rise of boutique fitness, particularly companies like SoulCycle and Flywheel, which gained significant popularity around 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:49">[02:47:49]</a>. John Foley, Peloton's founder, observed this trend in New York, the epicenter of high-end group fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:54">[02:52:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>. His personal frustration with committing to scheduled classes five days in advance at SoulCycle sparked the idea for Peloton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:54">[02:30:54]</a>.

Foley envisioned an infinitely scalable version of these popular spin classes, where the room wasn't bound by physical walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:29">[02:38:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:43">[02:40:43]</a>. This vision aligned with a key principle: "everything linear dies, everything on demand wins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:27">[03:13:27]</a>. This concept, also evident in the success of Netflix and Spotify, emphasizes accessing best-in-world content on one's own schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:13">[03:39:13]</a>.

Prior to founding Peloton in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:29">[02:31:29]</a>, John Foley served as the head of Barnes & Noble's Nook e-reader business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:11">[03:12:11]</a>. He also had a long career working for Barry Diller at IAC (Interactive Corp), a major [[history_and_strategy_of_technology_companies | tech and media conglomerate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:06">[03:26:06]</a>. Foley's background included working on teams like Citysearch and pront.com, and he had experience in rehabilitating businesses, such as growing Evite from small to significant revenue post-dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:35">[03:37:35]</a>.

## Initial Struggles and Breakthrough (2012-2014)

Despite Foley's impressive background and a revolutionary idea, Peloton faced immense difficulty securing funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:36">[03:36:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:54">[03:37:54]</a>. All venture capitalists initially passed on the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:42">[03:41:42]</a>. The company ultimately raised $400,000 from friends and family at a $2 million post-money valuation for its first round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>. This was followed by another $3.5 million round, also primarily from individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:08">[03:52:08]</a>.

Peloton's original vision was to build a high-quality bike with elegant software, allowing users to connect their own iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:11">[03:41:11]</a>. Initially, they did not want to produce their own content, hoping to partner with existing studios like SoulCycle or Flywheel for instructor content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:58">[03:42:58]</a>. A term sheet was even reached with Flywheel, but the deal fell through, forcing Peloton to pivot to a vertically integrated strategy, producing their own content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:49">[03:52:49]</a>.

In 2013, Peloton launched a Kickstarter campaign, which, while not technically a failure, did not generate significant traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:42">[03:59:42]</a>. They raised $307,332 against a $250,000 goal, but half of the backers were already investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:02">[04:24:02]</a>. This highlighted a key challenge: the product's "awesomeness" was hard to communicate without direct experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:02">[04:27:02]</a>.

To address this, Peloton made a "contrarian" decision for a tech company: they opened retail stores in malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:02">[04:31:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:02">[04:40:02]</a>. The first was in the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:02">[04:50:02]</a>. This allowed potential customers to experience the product firsthand, which proved crucial for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:02">[04:57:02]</a>.

Initially, the bike was priced at $1,200, but sales were slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:43">[04:59:43]</a>. Customer feedback revealed that the low price made people doubt the hardware's quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:02">[05:25:02]</a>. By raising the price to $2,245, Peloton transformed the perception of the bike into a "jewel, premium, expensive, aspirational luxury product," which significantly boosted sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:43">[05:29:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:02">[05:38:02]</a>. This strategy also ensured they attracted affluent customers with low price sensitivity, leading to incredibly low churn rates for their subscription service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:02">[05:46:02]</a>.

By the end of 2014, Peloton secured its first institutionally led funding round, a $10 million Series B, with Tiger Global contributing $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:02">[06:08:02]</a>. Tiger Global would later become the largest shareholder at Peloton's IPO, owning nearly 20% of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:02">[06:14:02]</a>.

## Growth and IPO (2015-2019)

Peloton experienced rapid revenue growth:
*   2015: ~$60 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:02">[06:19:02]</a>
*   2016: $170 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:02">[06:21:02]</a>
*   2017: $325 million in revenue, at a $1.3 billion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:02">[06:25:02]</a>

In 2018, Peloton introduced the Tread treadmill product and their digital app subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:02">[06:33:02]</a>. The digital app, priced at around $13 a month, offered a surprisingly full-featured experience, even for users without Peloton hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:02">[06:37:02]</a>. A key differentiator of the Peloton bike hardware is its ability to feed resistance and cadence data into the platform, enabling features like leaderboards and performance tracking that are not available with a standard bike and tablet setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:02">[06:50:02]</a>.

However, leading up to its IPO, Peloton faced a significant legal challenge. In early 2019, the National Music Publishers Association sued Peloton for $150 million, later increasing to $300 million, alleging improper use of music due to lack of sync licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:02">[07:07:02]</a>. This highlighted that music licensing represents a substantial portion of Peloton's subscription revenue cost of goods sold, unlike Spotify or radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:02">[07:41:02]</a>. Peloton requires multiple licenses (live performance and sync licenses) for its use of music, which makes it considerably more expensive than traditional streaming platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:02">[07:54:02]</a>.

By September 2019, after settling the music licensing lawsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:02">[08:44:02]</a>, Peloton went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:02">[08:46:02]</a>. For fiscal year 2019 (ending June 30), Peloton reported $915 million in revenue, more than double the previous year's $435 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:02">[08:58:02]</a>. Subscription revenue accounted for $181 million, growing even faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:02">[09:18:02]</a>. Both hardware and subscription segments showed healthy gross margins (around 40% and 66% respectively) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:02">[09:25:02]</a>.

At IPO, the company's valuation was around $8 billion, but it traded down 11% on opening, ending at a $7.2 billion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:02">[09:33:02]</a>. Peloton's customer acquisition cost (CAC) for connected fitness subscribers was estimated at $521 per gross subscriber, a very high number for a B2C company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:02">[10:37:02]</a>. However, with a loyal customer base and low churn (around 7-9% annual churn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:02">[10:55:02]</a>, the lifetime value (LTV) per customer over five years was estimated at $2,340 in subscription revenue, leading to significant profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:02">[10:59:02]</a>. This strong unit economics incentivized aggressive marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:02">[10:56:02]</a>.

The holiday 2019 "Peloton wife" commercial, while generating some controversy, proved to be effective marketing, making Peloton a trending pop-culture topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:02">[11:06:02]</a>.

## [[impact_of_pandemic_on_pelotons_business | Impact of Pandemic on Peloton's Business]] and Subsequent Challenges (2020-2022)

The [[impact_of_pandemic_on_pelotons_business | COVID-19 pandemic]] served as an unexpected boon for Peloton. The company experienced an "instant product market fit" with a much wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:02">[11:20:02]</a>. From January 2020, they added approximately one million subscribers in the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:02">[11:27:02]</a>. Digital subscribers surged from 100,000 to 1.2 million within 45 days of the pandemic's onset due to a three-month free trial offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:02">[11:51:02]</a>.

Revenue soared:
*   Fiscal Year 2020 (ended June 30): $1.8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:02">[11:36:02]</a>
*   Fiscal Year 2021: $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:02">[11:42:02]</a>

The stock price surged to a peak of over $150 per share, giving Peloton a market capitalization of $49 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:02">[11:50:02]</a>. Peloton was seen as the leader in the newly pioneered [[the_future_of_connected_fitness_and_market_opportunities | connected fitness]] category, inspiring numerous copycats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:02">[11:57:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:02">[12:08:02]</a>.

In September 2020, Peloton introduced the Bike+ model, priced at $2,495, while lowering the original bike's price to $1,895 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:02">[12:17:02]</a>. This pricing strategy was puzzling given the high demand and existing backlog of orders (four months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:02">[12:20:02]</a>. The Bike+ itself had product issues, such as a lower DPI screen and features that were not always desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:02">[12:43:02]</a>.

At this time, Peloton faced significant supply chain challenges as they didn't manufacture their own bikes in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:02">[12:29:02]</a>. To address this, in December 2020, Peloton acquired Precor, a Washington-based fitness equipment manufacturer, for $420 million in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:02">[12:46:02]</a>. The primary goal was to gain US-based manufacturing prowess and in-house capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:02">[13:00:02]</a>. A secondary benefit was Precor's commercial distribution channels, allowing Peloton to expand into hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:02">[13:02:02]</a>. In spring 2021, Peloton announced plans to build its own manufacturing facility, the Peloton Output Park, in Ohio, a further $400 million cash outlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:02">[13:11:02]</a>.

However, 2021 brought more challenges:
*   **Treadmill Recall:** In spring 2021, tragic accidents and even deaths associated with the Tread treadmill led to a recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:02">[13:46:02]</a>. Peloton's initial handling of the issue was criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:02">[13:53:02]</a>. The stock dropped 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:02">[14:05:02]</a>.
*   **Missed Earnings & Guidance Cut:** In November 2021, Peloton missed earnings, cut its outlook, and saw its stock plunge 32% in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:02">[14:19:02]</a>.
*   **"Mr. Big" Commercial:** The company faced an unexpected public relations hit when a character died on a Peloton bike in a "Sex and the City" reboot commercial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:02">[14:31:02]</a>. While seemingly minor, this incident highlighted the market's underlying uneasiness about the company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:02">[14:54:02]</a>.
*   **Inventory Glut:** By January 2022, news broke that Peloton was halting production of new hardware due to an inventory glut, indicating that pandemic-driven demand had dried up. The company was sitting on $1.3 billion worth of unsold inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:02">[15:37:02]</a>. This contradicted previous statements from John Foley who believed demand would continue to grow indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:02">[15:52:02]</a>. Revenue growth slowed dramatically to 9% in Q4 and 5% in Q1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:02">[16:08:02]</a>, and guidance for fiscal year 2022 was cut, projecting a year-over-year revenue decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:02">[16:37:02]</a>.

## [[financial_and_leadership_changes_at_peloton | Financial and Leadership Changes at Peloton]] (February 2022)

On January 20, 2022, activist investor Blackwell's Capital announced a 5% stake in Peloton, whose share price had fallen below its IPO price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:02">[17:10:02]</a>. Blackwell's published a deck calling for John Foley to resign and for the company to initiate a strategic sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:02">[17:31:02]</a>.

On February 8, 2022, Peloton announced its earnings, which were poor. They lowered guidance, pulled the plug on the Peloton Output Park manufacturing facility, and laid off 2,800 people, including 20% of their corporate staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:02">[17:50:02]</a>. Simultaneously, they announced that Barry McCarthy would become the new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:02">[18:00:02]</a>.

John Foley transitioned to Executive Chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:02">[18:25:02]</a>. Despite this shift, Foley maintains significant control, holding 39.6% of Peloton's voting power, with co-founders owning another 18% due to a dual-class stock structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:02">[19:40:02]</a>. This structure allows founders and insiders to hold stock with 20 votes per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:02">[19:47:02]</a>.

Barry McCarthy, a seasoned executive and "Acquired superhero," brings a wealth of experience from his roles as CFO at Netflix and Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>. He is known for his ability to manage subscription businesses and navigate challenging "wartime" scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:02">[09:26:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:02">[21:22:02]</a>. McCarthy's first email to the company emphasized "getting real" and confronting the truth, even when uncomfortable, with a focus on driving growth and taking risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:02">[20:41:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:02">[21:05:02]</a>. The market reacted positively to McCarthy's appointment, with Peloton's stock rising 25% the day of the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:02">[22:02:02]</a>.

## [[The Future of Connected Fitness and Market Opportunities | The Future of Connected Fitness and Market Opportunities]]

Despite its recent struggles, Peloton benefits from an insane level of customer love, with an NPS around 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:02">[22:07:02]</a>. The company successfully grew its membership from 700,000 to nearly 3 million subscribers during the pandemic, adding significant subscription revenue with incredibly low churn rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:02">[22:20:02]</a>. They invented the [[the_future_of_connected_fitness_and_market_opportunities | connected fitness]] category and remain its largest player, benefiting from network effects as friends join each other on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:02">[22:37:02]</a>.

Peloton's high price point has historically attracted affluent customers with low price sensitivity, contributing to its sticky business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:02">[22:50:02]</a>. However, as they expand down-market with financing options (like their partnership with Affirm, which involved Peloton paying Affirm significant fees to offer 0% financing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:02">[23:44:02]</a>, they face the challenge of retaining price-sensitive customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:02">[24:00:02]</a>.

A major bull case for Peloton lies in its potential for scale economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:12:02">[25:12:02]</a>. With its large member base, Peloton can invest more in high-quality content and attract the best instructors, creating a virtuous cycle similar to Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:02">[26:19:02]</a>. This allows them to offer significantly better content than smaller boutique fitness studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:02">[27:01:02]</a>. The instructors' contracts are likely structured to encourage retention, as their extensive content library may be pulled if they leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:02">[27:26:02]</a>.

The company's future success hinges on its ability to expand its addressable market beyond its initial affluent base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:02">[34:06:02]</a>. While Peloton currently has under 3 million subscribers globally, the potential for growth, especially through its accessible $12.99/month digital app, remains significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:57:02">[35:57:02]</a>. This digital offering, akin to the Netflix model for content, could appeal to a much broader demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:47:02">[36:47:02]</a>.

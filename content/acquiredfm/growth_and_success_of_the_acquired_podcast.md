The Acquired podcast, hosted by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, has experienced significant growth and achieved notable success, culminating in a major live event at the Chase Center in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

## Inception and Early Growth
The co-hosts, Ben and David, first met at a Passover seder in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. David had the idea for a podcast, a medium Ben "didn't even really know what a podcast was" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Ben was immediately keen on the "Acquired" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

The podcast has consistently felt like it was breaking out, but a significant shift occurred in May 2024 with coverage from The Wall Street Journal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This led to "a quarter million new subscribers" showing up "at our doorstep in a month, overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The podcast has accumulated over 5 million hours of listening, tripling in the last year alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This rapid [[podcast_growth_and_audience_dynamics | podcast growth]] highlights a dynamic expansion of its [[acquired_podcast_evolution_and_audience_growth | audience growth]].

## The Chase Center Live Event
The idea for a live show at the Chase Center originated from a call with the JP Morgan team, who initially suggested a small event in a corner of the venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Both Ben and David realized the potential for a larger event, leading to a "crazy proposal" for a dedicated "Acquired Live at Chase Center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

The partnership with JP Morgan Payments was crucial for the event's success, as they "deeply understand" the show and its content because they are listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The collaboration was described as fitting "like a glove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, and "really special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Preparation and Artistic Elements
Preparations for the live event were intense, with the team describing it as a "mad dash to create an amazing experience for every single one of the thousands of people that are there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This included designing stage art and posters, with an artist expressing amazement at seeing the "entire stadium lit up with the stuff that I worked on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The design aimed to be "big and grandiose and bright" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, providing an opportunity for the audience to "live inside the Acquired brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

Leading up to the event, ticket sales were robust, with only around 300 tickets remaining shortly before the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

### Key Guests and Moments
The event featured several prominent guests:
*   **Mike Taylor**: The artist behind the Acquired theme song, who performed it live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Mike Taylor is a major recording artist with "hundreds of millions of listens on [[spotifys_podcasting_strategy_and_the_integration_of_audiobooks | Spotify]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Mark Zuckerberg**: His appearance was a highlight, described as "beyond anything that we could have hoped or dreamed for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. His conversation was "electric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a> and "historic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. During the [[podcast_structure_and_interview_strategies | interview strategies]] section, Zuckerberg made a striking admission about a "20-year mistake" regarding political miscalculation at Facebook/Meta, which "everybody in the arena's jaw dropped" to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. This kind of transparency from a public company CEO was seen as a testament to his uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **Jamie Dimon**: The CEO of JP Morgan Chase, whose anticipated presence created "whispers and murmurs" in the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

### [[acquired_podcast_and_community_engagement | Community Engagement]]
A unique pre-event tradition for Ben and David, a run, was shared with over 100 listeners, allowing them to connect with the [[podcast_growth_and_audience_dynamics | audience dynamics]] and "work our nerves out a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Impact and Future
The live event was hailed as "unbelievable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a> and "such a spectacle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>, with the hosts noting, "Podcasts don't do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This aligns with the ethos of companies covered on the show: "the great companies don't follow the rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

The partnership with JP Morgan Payments was lauded as a "spectacular example" of achieving something together that neither entity could have done alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. The event was an "ultimate physical instantiation of Acquired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

While reflecting on "what's next," the hosts admit to being in a mindset of both "let's go big" and "never again," especially with young families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. However, the mention of "2025" suggests potential future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. The Acquired podcast exemplifies [[podcasting_as_a_medium_for_education_and_personal_branding | podcasting as a medium for education and personal branding]].

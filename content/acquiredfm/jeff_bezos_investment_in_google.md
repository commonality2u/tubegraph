The personal investment by [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff Bezos]] and MacKenzie Bezos in Google was a significant event, stemming indirectly from an Amazon acquisition and leading to substantial [[Jeff Bezos and McKenzie Bezos financial growth | financial growth]] for the Bezos couple.

## The Junglee Connection

Amazon acquired a company called Junglee, a comparison shopping site started by three Stanford Computer Science PhDs and a business person named Ram Sriram, formerly from Netscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Amazon purchased Junglee for approximately $150-175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The Junglee team, based in Palo Alto, was required by Amazon to move to Seattle to avoid a tax nexus in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The acquisition was ill-conceived and did not work out; within a few months, the Junglee team quit and moved back to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This team later went on to start the company that would be acquired by Walmart, becoming Walmart Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Ram Sriram's Early Google Investment

Back in Palo Alto, Ram Sriram, the business person from Netscape, connected with two other Stanford Computer Science PhDs: Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Following Junglee's acquisition and the team's new wealth, Larry and Sergey approached Ram to raise money for their project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Ram Sriram became the first investor in Google, providing $250,000 and joining the company's board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Jeff Bezos's Personal Investment

Approximately six months after Ram's investment, [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff Bezos]] learned about Google from Ram, with whom he remained friendly despite the failed Junglee acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Bezos called Ram, expressing interest in meeting Larry and Sergey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

[[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff Bezos]] and [[Jeff Bezos and McKenzie Bezos financial growth | MacKenzie Bezos]] flew to Silicon Valley and had breakfast at Ram's house with Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. After the breakfast, Bezos privately told Ram that he wanted to invest in Google on the same terms as Ram's seed investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Ram initially explained that the seed round had closed six months prior and major venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital were circling for a Series A round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. However, Bezos insisted, stating his desire to be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Ram advocated for Bezos, convincing Larry and Sergey to accept an additional $250,000 of [[Jeff Bezos and McKenzie Bezos financial growth | Jeff]] and [[Jeff Bezos and McKenzie Bezos financial growth | MacKenzie Bezos]]'s personal money at the original seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The subsequent Series A round for Google was famously split between John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins and Mike Moritz at Sequoia, valuing Google at $100 million post-money, which was considered "insane" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Mike Moritz reportedly commented on the Google investment, "We've never paid so much for so little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The seed valuation, where Bezos invested, is estimated to have been around $10 million or even lower post-money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Financial Impact and Legacy

It is considered safe to assume that [[Jeff Bezos and McKenzie Bezos financial growth | Jeff]] and [[Jeff Bezos and McKenzie Bezos financial growth | MacKenzie Bezos]] personally owned at least one percent of Google, even after dilution from the Series A round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Notably, Google went public directly after that single Series A venture round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

When Google IPO'd in 2004, its market cap was $23 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. At this point, the Bezos's shares would have been worth approximately $230 million, or a quarter-billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Over the 18 years since the IPO, Google's value has increased 65x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

[[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff Bezos]] has never publicly commented on whether he and [[Jeff Bezos and McKenzie Bezos financial growth | MacKenzie]] sold their Google shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. However, they would not have had the opportunity to sell before the IPO, meaning they held at least one percent of Google until its public offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This investment significantly contributed to [[Jeff Bezos and McKenzie Bezos financial growth | Jeff]] and [[Jeff Bezos and McKenzie Bezos financial growth | MacKenzie Bezos]]'s personal wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

This capital provided [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Bezos]] with ample funds for other ventures, including investments in projects like "crazy cool clocks," rocket companies (Blue Origin), and venture funds like Benchmark and PSL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The relationship maintenance, even after the failed Junglee acquisition, was crucial to this opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

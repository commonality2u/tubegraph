Open-mindedness is a crucial element for profitability in the investment world, as rigidity can be a significant enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This principle is starkly illustrated by the divergent paths of investing in high yield bonds versus the "Nifty 50" stocks.

## The Emergence of High Yield Bonds

The journey into high yield bond investing began at Citibank's bond department, which was considered a "backwater" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The task was to understand high yield bonds and start a fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This was an area most investment organizations avoided, often having rules against buying bonds rated below A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The absence of other bidders in this market was seen as a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

[[history_and_development_of_high_yield_or_junk_bonds | Mike Milken]] had an early interest in low-rated bonds, dating back to his graduation from Wharton in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He reportedly discovered a famous book by Hickman, which analyzed bond experiences from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This book revealed a counter-intuitive finding: the lower a bond's rating, the higher its actual rate of return, not just its promised yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Despite defaults and bankruptcies, including those during the Great Depression, the excess yield received was more than sufficient to offset credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This was a pivotal "aha moment" for Milken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

At that time, it was nearly impossible to issue a low-rated bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. These bonds were labeled "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Moody's 1978 manual famously defined a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This perspective highlights a fundamental flaw in traditional investment thinking: proclaiming an asset "not proper for investment regardless of price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Understanding [[market_perception_of_risk_in_high_yield_bonds | Risk in High Yield Bonds]]

The approach to high yield bonds can be likened to how life insurance companies operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Just as insurance companies make money knowing every policyholder will die, high yield bond investors can profit knowing some bonds will default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The key is how risk is managed:
1.  **Awareness**: The risk is known and doesn't come as a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
2.  **Analysis**: The risk can be analyzed, similar to a doctor assessing health for an insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
3.  **Diversification**: Risks are diversified, avoiding concentration in specific high-risk categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
4.  **Compensation**: The risk is well-compensated through higher yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

This strategy led to steady and safe profits even when investing in what were considered the "worst public companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## The Nifty 50: A Contrasting Philosophy

In contrast, in September 1969, Citibank's investment research department focused on the "Nifty 50" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. These were regarded as America's "best and fastest growing companies," believed to be immune to negative events and for which "there was no price too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This stance was the "polar opposite" of the approach to high yield bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

While the Nifty 50 commanded any price, high yield bonds were deemed undesirable at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Both stances proved to be incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. [[lessons_from_past_investment_trends_and_their_outcomes | Investing in the Nifty 50]] in 1969 and holding for five years resulted in the loss of "almost all your money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The primary reason was their excessive pricing; while the post-war S&P 500 average P/E ratio was 16, many Nifty 50 companies traded between 60 and 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Some Nifty 50 companies were not as "best" as perceived, while others were simply vastly overpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **IBM**: The "granddaddy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Xerox**: Lost its market to imports and had to find a new business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Patterns**: A consumer company that, like others in the sector, ultimately did not fare well due to disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The concept of disruption was largely ignored; "moats" were considered inviolable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. For instance, the simple fact that Xerox pricing copies at 30 cents created a "price umbrella" for foreign competitors was not considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This led to significant losses, with many Nifty 50 companies losing over 90% from their peak valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

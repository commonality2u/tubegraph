The [[origins_of_the_benchmark_dinner | Benchmark dinner]] tradition, initially conceived as an experiment, quickly evolved into a core practice for the firm, largely due to the unique interaction it fostered with external guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This practice is seen as nurturing curiosity, which is considered the "essential lifeblood" of the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Initial Experiment and Impact

The first significant dinner, held in late 2006 or early 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, included four outside guests alongside the partners: Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This gathering was described as "amazing" and "electric," demonstrating the powerful dynamic of open-ended, no-agenda explorations with external perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This success validated the concept, leading to the institutionalization of the dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Guest Selection Philosophy

Benchmark dinners frequently host "esteemed guests" beyond the five partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A key aspect of their guest selection is the preference for individuals with whom Benchmark has "haven't worked with or invested in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This approach aims to broaden the firm's learning and activation of curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Notable guests who have attended or been part of Benchmark's unique dinner experiences include:
*   Dylan Field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
*   Toby from Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   Jeff Bezos, with whom Benchmark partners have even traveled to meet, though the custom table is not portable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. These external engagements have taken place in various locations, including Seattle and Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Significance and Impact

The presence of external guests is vital for several reasons:
*   **Nurturing Curiosity** The dinners foster an environment of "constantly learning and activating our curiosity," a core purpose of the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Collective Effervescence** They facilitate a "collective effervescence of a group" that cannot be replicated in one-on-one meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Focused Attention** Benchmark considers the "spotlight of attention" to be the "biggest gift you can give to another human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Reinforcing Purpose** Interactions with guests like Dylan Field can be profoundly inspiring, reminding the partners "why we exist to serve people like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## The Role of the Table Design

The unique design of the Benchmark dining table, conceived by Jean-Marie Masoud and designed by Ole Lundberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, plays a crucial role in facilitating guest interaction. It is designed to "deconstruct power centers" and create a non-hierarchical, intimate setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. A key feature of this table is its ability to prevent sidebar conversations, ensuring that "everybody else can hear it," thus fostering "one conversation" among all participants, including guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This "one conversation element" is considered "so powerful" for getting the entire group "tuned in" to whatever topic is being discussed, whether it's good, bad, or tough news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This stands in contrast to common venture capital practices where partners might "pre-sell a deal" or engage in side conversations before a formal meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

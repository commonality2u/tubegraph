The candy industry, particularly chocolate, has been profoundly shaped by [[branding_and_marketing_strategies | advertising and marketing strategies]] throughout its history. From unbranded penny candies to globally recognized confectionery giants, the success of candy companies has often hinged on their ability to connect with consumers, build trust, and drive impulse purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:22">[02:34:22]</a>.

## Early Days: Unbranded and Local <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the candy market consisted largely of unbranded sweets like gumdrops and licorice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. These were sold wholesale by local bakers to regional retailers and drugstores, primarily targeting children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. There were no significant national or even local candy brands at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Hershey's Pioneering Approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>
Milton Hershey, an early chocolate entrepreneur, established a critical precedent for the industry. Recognizing the importance of ubiquity, he intentionally priced his Hershey's chocolate bars at a nickel, making them accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. He then aggressively pushed distribution to a wide array of outlets, including five and dime stores, grocery stores, gas stations, and newsstands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. This strategy of widespread affordability and distribution essentially "invented the modern candy industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. Being "first to Market and setting the taste" for American chocolate locked Hershey in as the dominant player for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## The Candy Bar Craze and Early Stunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>
The post-World War I era, coupled with Prohibition, saw an explosion of interest in candy bars as adults sought new "social lubricants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>. By the end of the 1920s, over 40,000 different candy bars, mostly from regional entrepreneurs, were being produced in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. Early marketing stunts were audacious; for example, the Curtis Candy Company chartered an airplane to drop Baby Ruth bars with paper parachutes over Pittsburgh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>.

Frank Mars's initial foray into combination bars with the "Marrow Bar" was not a success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. However, the introduction of the Milky Way bar, inspired by a malted milkshake, was a "huge success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. Mars and other manufacturers began building entirely different brands and franchises around slight variations of their core products (e.g., Milky Way, Snickers, Three Musketeers), rather than simply creating variations of one existing brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.

## The Rise of Modern Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>

### Hershey's Advertising Blind Spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>
For decades, Hershey maintained a strict policy of "not advertising at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>. This approach, stemming from a different era, meant they lacked a marketing department and relied solely on organic growth, with their annual plan simply stating "grow sales 4% every year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:13:51]</a>. This "brain deadness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:52">[02:37:52]</a> in marketing allowed Mars to gain a significant advantage.

### M&M's and the Power of Psychological Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>
After acquiring full ownership of M&M's in 1949, Forest Mars commissioned a comprehensive market study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:52">[02:14:52]</a>. The study revealed that M&M's were highly appealing to children, a segment the industry had largely shifted away from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>. Recognizing that parents were the actual buyers, Mars developed arguably "one of the most brilliant slogans and ad campaigns of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:49">[02:15:49]</a>: "The milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:54">[02:15:54]</a>. This slogan shrewdly appealed to parents' desire to avoid mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a>.

Mars further leveraged this insight by sponsoring popular children's television shows like *The Mickey Mouse Club* and *Howdy Doody* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:28">[02:17:28]</a>. The strategy proved incredibly successful, with M&M's becoming America's biggest-selling candy by 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:45">[02:17:45]</a>. To combat copycats, Mars began printing the iconic "M" on each candy, emphasizing authenticity and building [[branding_and_marketing_strategies | brand trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:10">[02:18:10]</a>.

### The Television Age and Retailer Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:01">[02:37:01]</a>
The advent of television in the mid-1950s provided candy companies with a powerful new tool to create demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:01">[02:37:01]</a>. Television commercials, with their quick taglines and emotional appeal, could "shift decades of customer loyalty in a matter of weeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:54">[02:20:54]</a>.

The rise of supermarkets also fundamentally altered the power dynamics. Supermarkets, consolidating retail power, demanded that candy manufacturers invest in significant marketing campaigns to secure shelf space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:37">[02:36:37]</a>. Mars recognized that 70% of candy purchases were impulse buys (a figure potentially higher today due to their efforts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:50">[02:34:50]</a> and successfully lobbied merchants to place candy displays strategically near cash registers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:50">[02:34:50]</a>.

### Price Wars and Strategic Advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a>
Hershey's reluctance to raise the price of its chocolate bar for nearly 70 years, instead shrinking its size, created a vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:18">[02:40:18]</a>. When Hershey finally doubled its price in 1969, consumers felt "outraged" and "gamed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:07">[02:43:07]</a>. Mars capitalized on this by increasing its advertising and the size of its bars while maintaining prices, initiating a "price in size war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a>. Mars's competitive advantage came from its products (like Snickers) that used cheaper ingredients (nougat, peanuts) but offered the same perceived value to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:09">[02:46:09]</a>.

### Global Expansion and Brand Association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:49">[02:55:49]</a>
Under Forest Mars's children, the company embarked on a massive globalization effort, expanding into Japan, China, Russia, the Middle East, and South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:42">[02:55:42]</a>. They unified product brands globally (e.g., Snickers is Snickers everywhere) and launched large-scale international marketing campaigns, notably sponsoring the Olympics, akin to [[visas_global_marketing_and_brand_strategy | Visa's global marketing and brand strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:49">[02:55:49]</a>.

Mars developed a strategy of associating its brands with "known, loved, Universal brands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:35">[03:27:35]</a>. This includes affiliations with Disney World, holiday commercials featuring M&M's characters, the Rolling Stones for Snickers (I Can't Get No Satisfaction ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">[02:56:55]</a>), and the [[nfls_influence_and_business_strategy | NFL]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:06">[03:03:06]</a>. M&M's even flew on the Space Shuttle, becoming a part of astronaut videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:15">[03:27:15]</a>.

In 1995, Mars executed a brilliant marketing stunt by asking consumers to vote on a new M&M's color to replace tan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:37">[03:28:37]</a>. Blue won, generating millions of calls and significant public engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:06">[03:29:06]</a>. They also were early adopters of cutting-edge technology, using computer-generated M&M's characters in commercials as early as 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:50">[03:27:50]</a>, shortly after *Jurassic Park* debuted the technology in cinema.

## Product Placement and its Lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:02">[03:23:02]</a>
In the late 1970s, Mars declined an opportunity for M&M's to be featured in Spielberg's *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, due to a required co-marketing commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:11">[03:23:11]</a>. Hershey's stepped in, and Reese's Pieces famously became the candy used to lure E.T. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:47">[03:23:47]</a> This "paradigm setting deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:33">[03:24:33]</a> reportedly tripled Reese's Pieces sales and established them as a movie theater concession staple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:39">[03:24:39]</a>. While Mars missed a notable opportunity, it ultimately did not significantly hurt their long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:26">[03:28:26]</a>, highlighting the enduring power of well-established brands and constant marketing efforts.

## Conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>
The candy industry's evolution demonstrates that while product innovation is crucial, [[marketing_strategies_and_customer_retention | marketing strategies and customer retention]] play an equally vital role in building lasting empires. Companies that understood consumer psychology, leveraged new media, and strategically positioned their brands gained significant advantages. The contrast between Hershey's initial reliance on pioneering products without advertising and Mars's aggressive, scientific approach to marketing, showcases a [[historical_changes_in_consumer_behavior_and_media_consumption | historical change in consumer behavior and media consumption]] and a shift towards marketing as a core business discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:32">[02:14:32]</a>.

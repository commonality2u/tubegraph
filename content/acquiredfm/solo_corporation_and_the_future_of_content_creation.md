The concept of a "solo corporation" is emerging as a significant model in the future of content creation and business. This model, exemplified by "Not Boring," a newsletter and investment empire run by Packy McCormick, challenges traditional business structures by operating as a single-person entity leveraging various digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>.

## The Not Boring Model
Not Boring, founded by Packy McCormick, is described as the number one Substack newsletter on business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>. McCormick reinvented both the media business model and the startup investing business model, all while maintaining a distinct personal flair and whimsical voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>.

Key characteristics of this solo corporation include:
*   **One-Person Operation** Not Boring is a business run by a single individual, handling content creation, business strategy, and even investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. McCormick states he does not have a formal long-term plan, prioritizing content creation week by week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:43">[01:51:43]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Platforms** The existence and success of Not Boring are heavily reliant on digital platforms like Substack, Twitter, and AngelList <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. Substack provides a free publishing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>, Twitter serves as a primary growth driver for audience engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, and AngelList enables "Not Boring Capital" to operate as a venture fund without a traditional back office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>. This reliance on [[Strategies for creating and maintaining power in platform businesses | platform businesses]] allows for significant operational efficiency and cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:55">[02:11:55]</a>.
*   **Revenue Model - Sponsorships over Subscriptions** Initially considering [[Business models in the digital media and subscription space | subscriptions]], McCormick opted for an advertising-based model, particularly through sponsored deep dives into companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. He made this choice to prioritize audience growth over direct revenue, believing that broader reach would eventually lead to greater monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. This model allows him to maintain an expansive, free content offering while generating substantial income; Not Boring generated around $750,000 in revenue with outstanding invoices in late 2021, on track to cross $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:30">[01:37:30]</a>.

## The Future of Content Creation and Business
McCormick's work reflects a broader shift in [[Challenges and strategies in developing impactful content | content creation]] and business:

*   **"Power to the Person" and Solo Corporations** McCormick has predicted the rise of "solo corporations" and even "trillion-dollar market cap organizations... run by just one person" within a decade or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>. He points to Bitcoin as an existing example of a trillion-dollar market cap entity with no employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:12">[01:50:12]</a>. This vision emphasizes the increasing ability of individuals to create immense value and manage complex entities with minimal traditional overhead, thanks to technological advancements and specialized services.
*   **Transparency and New Journalism** McCormick operates with radical transparency, openly disclosing sponsorships and personal investments in his content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. This contrasts with traditional journalistic models where there is a strict "wall" between editorial and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. McCormick argues that this transparency builds trust with his audience, who understand his incentives upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. His approach to [[the_evolution_of_journalism_and_sponsored_content | journalism and sponsored content]] focuses on providing deeply researched, high-quality analysis, even for sponsored pieces, making them valuable to readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.
*   **Optimism and Niche Audiences** Not Boring thrives on an optimistic tone towards technology and startups, appealing to an audience of founders and optimists in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. This contrasts with more critical or cynical tech journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. By catering to a specific audience with a shared mindset, McCormick fosters loyalty and engagement, enabling unique monetization strategies like his venture fund, Not Boring Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:56">[01:53:56]</a>.
*   **Challenges and Trade-offs** Despite its success, the solo corporation model faces inherent limitations:
    *   **Founder Dependence** The business is heavily reliant on the individual. If McCormick were to stop writing, the momentum would slow, and the business would likely cease to exist in its current form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:51">[02:14:51]</a>. This makes scaling beyond personal capacity difficult, as bringing in other writers could dilute the unique voice and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:22">[02:15:22]</a>.
    *   **Limited Time for Diversification** While the brand could expand into other products (e.g., merchandise), McCormick has limited time to pursue such ventures without diluting the core content, which is the primary driver of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:02">[02:16:02]</a>.
    *   **Unpredictable Process** The content creation process for Not Boring is described as an unquantifiable, "magic" process, making it difficult to document or replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:58">[02:43:58]</a>. This personal, intuitive process is a core strength but also a limiting factor for traditional scaling.
*   **Flywheel Effect and Network Economies** The "Not Boring flywheel" centers on the audience, which attracts founders and sponsors. The content (Monday pieces) then draws in new audience members, reinforcing the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:34">[02:32:34]</a>. The alignment between content, audience, and investing is a key driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:51">[02:33:51]</a>. While not having strong direct network effects like social media, the growth in audience makes the platform more attractive to sponsors and founders, leading to more interesting content and conversations, which in turn attracts more readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:52">[02:41:52]</a>.

In conclusion, the solo corporation model, as exemplified by Not Boring, represents a potent force in the future of content creation, enabling individuals to build substantial businesses and influence through direct audience engagement, transparent monetization, and strategic leveraging of digital platforms. It highlights a shift towards more personalized, nimble, and purpose-driven content ecosystems.

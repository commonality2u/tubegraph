Vouch is an insurance company specifically designed for the **technology industry** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>. It provides protection against litigation, theft, and cyber threats for tech startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>.

## Business Model & Target Market

Vouch's core clientele consists of [[venture_capital | venture]]-backed technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:27">[01:29:27]</a>. They made a strategic decision to focus deeply on this niche, allowing them to excel at underwriting for these specific businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>. This focus means Vouch declines business from typical "main street" enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:45">[01:29:45]</a>.

The company aims to provide insurance in minutes, contrasting with the typical 8 to 12 weeks it takes through traditional brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48">[01:25:48]</a>. Vouch creates its own policies, specifically designed from scratch to address risks unique to technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>, such as cap table coverage and cloud coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.

## Operational Model: The Three Layers of Insurance

The insurance industry typically operates with three distinct layers:
1.  **Distribution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>: Handled by brokers who sell policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>.
2.  **Underwriting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:43">[01:26:43]</a>: The process of designing policies and assessing risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>.
3.  **Capacity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>: The capital reserved to pay out claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46">[01:26:46]</a>.

Vouch's strategy involves owning as much of this value chain as possible to maintain control over decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:15">[01:28:15]</a>. Initially, they obtained licenses to sell insurance like any other company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>. However, upon realizing [[product_market_fit | product market fit]] three months after launch, they quickly moved to build the "Vouch insurance company" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:15">[01:28:15]</a>. This involved developing their own policies and partnering with the world's largest reinsurance company for capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>. While the initial product iteration took 1.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>, owning more of the infrastructure allows them to iterate on products in months and weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:35">[01:28:35]</a>.

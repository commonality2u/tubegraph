Early investments in technology companies can lead to significant returns, as exemplified by the early funding rounds of Google. These investments often involve individuals with prior tech industry experience, and established venture capital firms.

## Case Study: Google's Early Funding
The story of Google's initial funding highlights the intertwined nature of early tech investments and the individuals involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Ram Shriram's Seed Investment
Ram Shriram, a business professional from Netscape and a co-founder of Junglee, became connected with Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both Stanford Computer Science PhDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Shriram made the first investment in Google, contributing $250,000, and subsequently joined Google's board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos's Personal Investment
Months after Shriram's initial investment, Jeff Bezos, maintaining a friendly relationship with Shriram despite Junglee's failed acquisition by Amazon, learned about Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Bezos, accompanied by MacKenzie Bezos, visited Shriram in Silicon Valley to meet Page and Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Despite the seed round being closed and larger [[venture_capital_industry_dynamics | venture capital]] firms like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital circling for a Series A, Jeff Bezos insisted on investing personally at the original seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Shriram successfully advocated for an additional $250,000 investment from Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos's personal funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Google's Growth and IPO
Google's Series A round, led by John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and Mike Moritz of Sequoia Capital, followed shortly after, valuing the company at $100 million post-money, considered "insane for the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Mike Moritz reportedly expressed concern, stating, "We've never paid so much for so little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Remarkably, Google went public in 2004 with only a Series A funding round, demonstrating its immediate cash-generative potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. At its IPO, Google had a market cap of $23 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. It is estimated that Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos personally owned at least one percent of Google, even after dilution from the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. At IPO, their shares would have been worth approximately $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Over the subsequent 18 years, Google's value has increased 65-fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

Even if Jeff Bezos was not selling Amazon shares, his personal investment in Google provided substantial capital for other ventures, such as investments in large-scale projects like clocks and rocket companies, and [[venture_capital_and_crossover_investing | venture funds]] like Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This highlights how maintaining relationships, even after business ventures part ways, can lead to lucrative opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

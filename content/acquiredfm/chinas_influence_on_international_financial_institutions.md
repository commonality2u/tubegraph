A significant portion of time on the House Financial Services Committee has been dedicated to "China work" [00:00:11]. This was a primary focus during the first year in Congress, aiming to reform international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) [00:00:15].

It was observed that these institutions have been "largely overrun by China" [00:00:21]. Consequently, substantial efforts were made to implement reforms within these bodies [00:00:23].

Beyond direct institutional influence, other areas of focus included China's capital markets and addressing [[payment_and_financial_industry_trends | capital markets issues]] like the GameStop meme stock craze [00:00:29]. While specific legislative outcomes regarding the meme stock phenomenon were disappointing, with a bipartisan bill to shorten settlement times from two days to one day failing to pass [00:01:00], these discussions highlighted broader concerns within financial systems.

The speaker also briefly touches upon current macroeconomic concerns, specifically mentioning [[interpreting_the_macroeconomic_environment_through_investing | inflation issues]] [00:03:01].

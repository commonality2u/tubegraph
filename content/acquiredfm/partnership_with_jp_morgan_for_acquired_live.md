Acquired has established a significant partnership with [[collaboration_with_jp_morgan_payments | JP Morgan Payments]] for their live podcast events.

## Origin of the Partnership
The partnership began with the first major live show, [[Acquired Live at Chase Center | Acquired Live at Chase Center]], held in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This event, described as "incredible," featured a [[insights_from_conversation_with_mark_zuckerberg_at_acquired_live | conversation with Mark Zuckerberg]] at the iconic [[Chase Center | Chase Center Arena]], in collaboration with [[collaboration_with_jp_morgan_payments | JP Morgan Payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Following the success of the San Francisco event, a post-show discussion with the [[collaboration_with_jp_morgan_payments | JP Morgan team]] led to the mutual decision to host another event in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This follow-up event is [[Acquired Live at Radio City Music Hall | Acquired Live at Radio City Music Hall]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Purpose and Funding
The live shows, including the upcoming [[Acquired Live at Radio City Music Hall | Radio City Music Hall]] event, are explicitly stated to be "nowhere near profit generating" for either Acquired or [[collaboration_with_jp_morgan_payments | JP Morgan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The primary goal is to celebrate the Acquired podcast and its listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

All revenue generated from ticket sales is dedicated to covering [[event_planning_and_production_for_acquired_live | production costs]], such as set design and compensating the hundreds of crew members required to stage the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Acquired expresses gratitude to [[collaboration_with_jp_morgan_payments | JP Morgan]] for their role in enabling these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

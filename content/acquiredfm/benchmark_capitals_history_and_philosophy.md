[[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark Capital]] is a prominent venture capital firm known for its unique structure and consistent ability to generate outsized returns across multiple generations of partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. Unlike many of its peers, [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] famously believes that venture capital doesn't scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a>. They have intentionally resisted growth in fund size, avoided junior partners, platform teams, and multi-stage investing, yet have been early backers of some of the world's most significant technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:02">[02:01:02]</a>.

## The Venture Capital Landscape in the 1990s

To understand the [[founding_story_of_benchmark_capital | founding story of Benchmark]], it's essential to look at the Silicon Valley venture capital scene in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. The ecosystem was much smaller, with about 100 times fewer venture capitalists than today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. [[Kleiner Perkins and John Doerr | Kleiner Perkins]] and its partner, John Doerr, were the dominant force, considered the "800-pound gorilla" of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Doerr had a remarkable track record, backing companies like Compaq, Intuit, Sun, Netscape, Amazon, and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

[[Kleiner Perkins and John Doerr | Kleiner Perkins']] model had two key characteristics:
*   **Centralized Power**: John Doerr was unquestionably "the guy," acting as CEO, leader, and top performer, handling everything from courting deals to attempting to pass board seats to junior partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
*   **"Modern Keiretsu" Model**: They fostered a network where portfolio companies were encouraged or even "forced" into partnerships and business development relationships with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:23]</a>. This was valuable in an era where product-market fit was less organic, and distribution often relied on deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

Other notable firms at the time included Sequoia (still up-and-coming, despite being nearly 20 years old), Greylock, and Venrock (the "Rockefeller" venture arm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. Two lesser-known firms, Technology Venture Investors (TVI) and Merrill Pickard Anderson and Eyre, shared an office building on Sand Hill Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>. TVI gained prominence as the sole venture capital investor in Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>, while Merrill Pickard had success with Palm Pilot and semiconductor companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of Benchmark: A Quest for Equal Partnership

Discontent began to simmer within these older firms, particularly regarding economic structures. Venture firms have two main economic components: the fund's "carry" (percentage of profits) and the "management company" (which earns annual fees and typically owns the firm's governance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>. Historically, founding partners often owned and controlled the management company, giving them discretion over fees and limiting junior partners' control and financial upside beyond carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.

This created resentment among younger partners. Robert "Bob" Kagle, a partner at TVI, exemplified this dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>. Kagle, who came from a working-class background in Flint, Michigan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>, developed an "almost religious fervor" for the idea of an equal partnership, believing anything else was morally wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>. He pushed for this at TVI, but the senior partners, having made substantial money from Microsoft, decided to "declare victory" and dissolve the firm rather than change their structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.

Dave Marquardt, Kagle's mentor at TVI and the Microsoft investor, shared a philosophy that foreshadowed [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s future: "The venture business is an intensely personal relationship business and it's not an industry that scales well... The CEOs are there to support and be steady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:36:00">[29:36:00]</a>.

## The [[founding_story_of_benchmark_capital | Founding of Benchmark Capital]]

In early 1994, Bob Kagle approached his friend Bruce Dunleavy, a partner at Merrill Pickard, with the idea of starting a new firm based on equal partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:47:00">[30:47:00]</a>. Bruce, while honored, initially hesitated due to financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>. However, when Merrill Pickard also resisted the equal economics model, Bruce and his colleague Andy Ratcliffe decided to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:07]</a>.

The initial team formed with Kagle, Dunleavy, and Ratcliffe. Bruce suggested bringing in an entrepreneur to add different perspectives, leading to the recruitment of Kevin Harvey, who had successfully sold two companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:12:00">[38:12:00]</a>. The four well-known founders of [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark Capital]] were now in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:08:00">[39:08:00]</a>. They sought a fifth partner for diversification and investment capacity, recruiting Val Vaden, who came from a software buyout background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a>.

In late 1994, the five partners (Bob Kagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, Kevin Harvey, and Val Vaden) prepared to raise their first fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:56:00">[39:56:00]</a>. They chose the audacious name "Benchmark Capital," signaling their aspiration "to set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>. Their prospectus prominently featured the motto "There is always room at the top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:55:00">[40:55:00]</a>.

Breaking from the industry standard 20% carry, [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] demanded a "premium carry" of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:16:00">[42:16:00]</a>, positioning themselves as a premium product from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:00">[42:23:00]</a>. This generated mixed reactions from Limited Partners (LPs); Horsley Bridge famously loved it and became a long-term investor, while others, like Stanford University, found it "laughable" and even tried to "blackball" [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] from the LP community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:32:00">[43:32:00]</a>.

The founders embraced Jim Collins's book "Built to Last," even handing copies to LPs during their pitches, aligning with their goal of building an enduring firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:42:00">[48:42:00]</a>. Despite the initial pushback, they successfully raised an $85 million fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:03:00">[44:03:00]</a>.

## Early Challenges and the Rise of "Swagger"

The early days of [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] were not without challenges. By the end of 1996, Val Vaden left the firm, as his buyout investment style didn't align with [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s focus on formation-stage technology and internet companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>. This transition, combined with missing major deals like Amazon and Yahoo in 1995-1996, led to a period of "depression" within the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>.

To re-inject "swagger" into the firm, the remaining four partners (Kagle, Dunleavy, Ratcliffe, and Harvey) decided to recruit a fifth, highly aggressive and competitive partner: David Beirne, the top executive recruiter in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:43:00">[56:43:00]</a>. Beirne, known for his relentless hustle and self-proclaimed status as a "leading executive search firm in high technology" even before having clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:49:00">[57:49:00]</a>, was brought in with the promise of making "big bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.

Beirne's first major deal was Webvan, an ambitious e-commerce startup aiming to deliver "anything you want from the web on a van" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Despite its eventual failure, [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s $3.5 million investment (split with Sequoia) in Webvan, which at its peak had an $8 billion market cap, was a "great risk-adjusted bet" and an example of the "swagger bet" a venture firm should make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

## The eBay Phenomenon

The year 1997 proved to be an "Annus Mirabilis" (year of miracles) for [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Pierre Omidyar, an engineer who had previously worked with Bruce Dunleavy at a pen computing company called Ink, started "Auction Web" (later eBay) as a side project while at General Magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. When server costs forced him to reluctantly charge a small listing fee, he was "deluged with checks" â€“ a clear sign of product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

Despite eBay's rapid growth and profitability, most venture capitalists turned them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>, viewing the business of selling "Beanie Babies" as non-serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>. [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] saw the potential and, with the collective effort of the partnership (Bruce, Bob, David Beirne, Kevin, and Andy), offered a $6.7 million Series A investment at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

Crucially, [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] also structured "equity-backed loans" of $750,000 each to Omidyar and Jeff Skoll (eBay's first business hire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. This "secondary" transaction, highly unconventional at the time, incentivized the founders to reject a $50 million acquisition offer from Knight Ridder and pursue building a much larger company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. This strategic move, which pre-dated later widely adopted secondary practices, allowed the founders to "take some money off the table" and focus on growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>.

[[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] was also instrumental in recruiting Meg Whitman from Hasbro to be eBay's CEO, which Wall Street loved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:46">[01:22:46]</a>. When eBay went public in September 1998, just over a year after [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s investment, their stake was worth $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. By the time the lockup expired six months later, it was worth over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>. This single investment, from an $85 million fund, generated billions in returns, validating [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s high-carry model and securing its place in venture capital history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.

[[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s success also led to a follow-on investment in Accept.com, an e-commerce payments company incubated within their firm, which was later acquired by Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:36">[01:26:36]</a>.

## The Imperial Era and Subsequent Refocusing

Following eBay's success, [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] faced new challenges. They were now at the "height of their powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>, with targets on their backs instead of being the ones targeting the established firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>. They were overwhelmed with opportunities, including joint ventures with Fortune 500 companies like Goldman Sachs, GM, Nordstrom, and Toys R Us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>.

Despite their philosophy of not scaling, [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] experimented with growth. They:
*   Raised a $1 billion fourth fund for their U.S. operations (previous funds were much smaller, around $85M-$175M) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:01">[02:18:01]</a>.
*   Expanded internationally to Europe and Israel, creating separate, equally-structured partnerships (Benchmark Europe became Balderton, Benchmark Israel became Pitango) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:30">[02:18:30]</a>. This meant "renting the brand" and instilling "The Benchmark way" in new partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:30">[02:19:30]</a>.

This period, roughly 2001-2010, was described as a "dark" or "not great" decade for [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:50">[02:29:50]</a>. The "sins of omission" were significant:
*   **Google**: They failed to "pursue" Google with their usual aggressiveness, missing out on a generational defining company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:40">[02:22:40]</a>.
*   **Skype**: The international expansion created internal confusion (which fund should lead?), leading to them losing the deal for the promising European company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:27">[02:24:27]</a>.
*   **Facebook**: Conflicts of interest due to an investment in Friendster prevented them from pursuing Facebook, despite early interest from Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:36">[02:25:36]</a>.

Around 2004-2005, the partnership realized their missteps. Kevin Harvey reportedly initiated a discussion about "wandering in the woods" and suggested refocusing on their core strategy: "invest in California with the right size funds, do early stage, focus only on the game on the field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:50">[02:27:50]</a>. The firm decided to unwind its international expansions and massive fund sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>.

## Generational Transfers and the "Fab Four" Era

The true test of [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s equal partnership philosophy came with its first generational transfer. In the mid-2000s, David Beirne, Andy Ratcliffe, and Alex Balkanski stepped back from active GP roles. Crucially, they adhered to the [[founding_story_of_benchmark_capital | founding principles]] by taking "no tail economics" in the new fund, meaning they gave up their direct share of future fund carry and governance, though they remained large LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:38">[02:31:38]</a>. This clean break allowed the firm to truly reset.

The new core lineup for Fund 6 (mid-2000s) was Bruce Dunleavy, Bob Kagle, Kevin Harvey, and Bill Gurley. To re-energize the firm, they embarked on an impressive recruitment spree, bringing in a new generation of partners. The key challenge for [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s equal partnership model is that there's no "try before you buy" for new GPs; they must be hired directly as equal partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>. This narrows the candidate pool to fiercely competitive yet unbelievably collaborative individuals, typically in their 30s, who have already proven themselves as good venture capitalists but are seeking full economic equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:31">[03:04:31]</a>.

This led to the formation of the "Fab Four" era, a "refounding" of the firm:
*   **Bill Gurley**: Joined around 1999, Gurley (formerly a Wall Street analyst who wrote "Above the Crowd") brought a deeply analytical approach, particularly to marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. His investment in Uber would become the largest win of Fund 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.
*   **Peter Fenton**: Joined from Accel (which had just done Facebook), Fenton was known for being one step ahead in sourcing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>. He took a significant "gut check" to leave Accel's Facebook fund economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. He would go on to back Twitter, Docker, New Relic, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Mitch Laskey**: An "unsung" part of the Fab Four, Laskey was a games industry veteran (Jamdat) who became a successful investor in gaming (Riot Games, Thatgamecompany) as well as consumer social companies like Snap and Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Matt Cohler**: Joining from Facebook (employee #5) and LinkedIn, Cohler had a fundamental understanding of consumer social products and the impact of AWS on the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. He famously stated that a VC's job is "not to see the future but to see the present very clearly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. His investments included Instagram and Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

Fund 7 (2011), with its $550 million size and the perfectly aligned Fab Four, became a "speed run in venture capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. It included investments in Uber, Snap, Discord, Stitch Fix, Duo Security, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. At its peak, Fund 7 was reportedly sitting on a 25x return before fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## The Uber Saga and its Aftermath

[[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s investment in Uber in 2011 ($10 million Series A at a $60 million post-money valuation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a> became a core part of Fund 7's massive success, valued at $8 billion in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. However, the relationship between [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] (represented on the board by Bill Gurley) and Uber's founder, Travis Kalanick, deteriorated as Uber faced scandals and intense public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

Bill Gurley publicly raised concerns about out-of-control valuations and founder behavior in the private markets, seemingly referencing Uber without naming it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. In 2017, [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] famously sued Travis Kalanick, a move that carried significant reputational risk in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. While the lawsuit did not significantly harm [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s long-term standing, it is widely believed to have precipitated the end of the "Fab Four" era, causing partners to retire earlier than they otherwise would have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

## [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] Today: The Current Partnership

The transitions continued, with Matt Cohler and Mitch Laskey stepping back after Fund 9. Bill Gurley also stepped back after an additional fund cycle, leaving Peter Fenton as the sole active GP from the "Fab Four" era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

The current [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] partnership includes:
*   **Peter Fenton**: The "Elder Statesman" from the previous era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **Eric Vishria**: An operator and former VP of Marketing at Loudcloud/Opsware, he joined in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. His investments include Confluent, Amplitude, and Benchling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
*   **Sarah Tavel**: Joined in 2017, she is the first woman GP at [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. With a background at Bessemer (where she sourced Pinterest) and Greylock, she's known for her analytical approach to consumer and marketplace investing. Her first investment was the non-consensus crypto analysis tool Chainalysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
*   **Chetan Puttagunta**: Joined in 2018, he was a successful baby GP from NEA with investments in Elastic, Mulesoft, and MongoDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   **Miles Grimshaw**: The most recent addition, joining in 2021 from Thrive Capital, where he was involved with companies like Benchling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

This current team comprises a mix of experienced enterprise and consumer investors, carrying forward [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s legacy.

## [[investment_philosophy_of_howard_marks_and_andrew_marks | Investment Philosophy of Benchmark Capital]]

[[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s core philosophy is deeply rooted in its equal partnership model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>:

*   **Equal Partnership**: Every active General Partner (GP) is an equal owner of the firm and receives equal carry in each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>. This fosters "unbelievable trust" and teamwork, as no one is incentivized to claim credit or prioritize their own career trajectory over the collective success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. This structure means [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] avoids internal conflicts common in firms with junior/senior hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:57">[01:42:57]</a>.
*   **All-Star Team**: The model only works if every partner "brings it at an equal level" of effort and output, demanding "fiercely competitive" individuals who are also "unbelievable teammates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This leads to partners typically retiring when they can no longer maintain 100% intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:53">[01:46:53]</a>.
*   **Boutique by Design**: [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] deliberately does not scale, focusing on a small number of partners who can devote nearly all their time to making investment decisions and supporting portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This contrasts with firms that build large "platform" teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:45">[02:04:45]</a>.
*   **Service Provider Mentality**: Influenced by David Beirne's background, [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] views itself as a "service provider" to entrepreneurs, a counter-cultural idea at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **"Correct Non-Consensus" Bets**: A core tenet, often attributed to Howard Marks, is that to make money, one must be "non-consensus and right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] thrives on identifying opportunities that others dismiss (like eBay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>.
*   **Adaptability**: [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] partners are "learning machines," constantly adapting. Their strategy shifted from "seed and startup" to Series A as the market changed with the rise of Angel investors and AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. They famously host "Benchmark dinners" with CEOs of companies they missed to understand their errors and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
*   **Exit Strategy**: [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] is known for knowing "how and when to sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. They are not afraid to liquidate positions in their portfolio companies, even at significant valuations, to ensure returns for their LPs and allow the next generation of partners to operate without being tied to past fund performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## Impact and Legacy

[[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]]'s model, while difficult to replicate, has proven highly successful. They have achieved two of the highest-returning venture funds of their scale in history (Fund 1 and Fund 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. Their "American green dollars" are highly sought after by entrepreneurs, often accepted at lower valuations, because a [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm | Benchmark]] investment "completely de-risks your next round of capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a> due to other VCs' reverence for the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. The firm's long-standing success serves as a powerful case study in competitive counter-positioning and the impact of internal firm architecture on external performance in the venture capital industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

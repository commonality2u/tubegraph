## Discovery and Early Development of Insulin (1920s)
In 1921, the pancreatic hormone insulin was discovered and extracted by a laboratory group at the University of Toronto Medical School in Toronto, Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Insulin regulates glucose absorption into the body and is the primary anabolic hormone in most animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Insufficient insulin production leads to diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

The Toronto group included physician Frederick Banting, medical student Charles Best, a chemist, and laboratory head John Macleod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Banting and Best are historically credited with the primary work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Banting and Macleod were awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

At the time, type 1 diabetes was a death sentence with no effective treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The accepted treatment was a "starvation diet" of 200-500 calories per day, designed to prolong life until a cure was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Banting and Best's team isolated a hormone from dog pancreases, which they called insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Injecting this extract into human diabetes patients led to "miraculous recoveries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. However, insulin was not a cure; patients needed regular injections (initially every few hours) to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Commercialization and Ethical Considerations
There was a strong cultural firewall between industry and medical science in the early 20th century, making it unethical to profit from medical breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Despite this, the University of Toronto licensed insulin production rights to Eli Lilly, a large American drug company in Indiana, granting them a one-year exclusive development license to mass-produce insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

Eli Lilly's strategy involved acquiring cow and pig pancreases, which were abundant waste products from meat production centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Eli Lilly agreed to report any manufacturing advances back to the University of Toronto but retained rights to their brand of insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This partnership helped establish Eli Lilly as a leading pharmaceutical company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]]'s Inception
August Krogh, a 1920 Nobel Prize winner from Denmark, nominated Banting and Macleod for the Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. His wife, Marie Krogh, was diagnosed with diabetes in 1920, leading them to seek information about insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. They met with Dr. Elliot Joslin in Boston, who informed them about the Toronto discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

August Krogh visited the Toronto lab and, with the help of Marie's physician Hans Christian Hagedorn, secured rights to bring insulin production to Scandinavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. In 1923, the Kroghs and Hagedorn, in partnership with August Kongsted of the Lion Chemical Factory, successfully produced insulin in Copenhagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

In 1924, Krogh, Hagedorn, and Kongsted established a new independent institution, Nordisk Insulin, to produce and distribute insulin throughout Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This operating company was 100% owned and controlled by a nonprofit foundation, with a dual mission: to sell insulin at cost in Scandinavia for public health and export it elsewhere at market prices, using profits to fund further diabetes research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. This foundation-controlled structure still exists today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

Nordisk Insulin's early employees included brothers Harold and Thorvald Pedersen, who were engineers and tinkerers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. Due to conflict with Hagedorn, the Pedersen brothers were fired and, capitalizing on Denmark's lack of drug patents at the time, founded their own insulin company, Novo Insulin, in Copenhagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This began a 65-year period of intense competition between Nordisk and Novo until their merger in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Innovation in Insulin

### Insulin as a Chronic Disease Treatment
Insulin is a chronic, non-curative treatment, meaning patients require daily or multiple daily injections for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. This creates a highly durable, recurring revenue stream for pharmaceutical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

Early insulin was primitive, requiring patients to dissolve solid tablets in boiled water and self-inject with large glass syringes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. It also contained impurities, leading to side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.

### Innovation Driven by Competition
The intense competition between Novo and Nordisk spurred significant innovations:
*   **Shelf-stable liquid insulin:** Novo quickly developed a more efficient process to produce and sell liquid insulin at half the price of Nordisk's tablets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>.
*   **Longer-lasting insulin (NPH):** Nordisk retaliated by developing protamine insulin, or NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn), which was more stable and required fewer daily injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. Nordisk refused to license NPH to Novo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>.
*   **Improved Protamine Insulin:** Novo worked around Nordisk's patents and developed their own improved version of protamine insulin, leading to lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

### World War II and Post-War Shift
During World War II, when Denmark was occupied by Nazis, Nordisk's international licensing revenue dropped to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. In contrast, Novo, under Nazi direction, massively expanded production to supply insulin across Nazi-occupied Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.

After the war, Novo emerged as the largest insulin producer in Europe, with increased resources for scientific research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. They developed lent insulin in the 1940s, a slower-acting basal insulin for continuous blood sugar stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. Eli Lilly licensed this product from Novo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.

In the 1970s, Novo introduced MC insulin (Monocomponent insulin), the first 100% pure, zero-antibody potential insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

### Rise of Type 2 Diabetes and Genetic Engineering (1980s)
Between 1980 and 2016, the number of type 2 diabetes patients quadrupled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. Until this period, type 2 diabetes (then called "non-insulin dependent diabetes") was not treated with insulin due to insufficient animal-sourced supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. It took 8,000 pounds of pancreatic glands from 23,500 animals to make a single pound of human insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. By 1980, over 1 million animals were needed annually for just 30,000 diabetes patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

In 1980, Genentech and Eli Lilly partnered to revolutionize drug production with recombinant DNA and genetic engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. Their first genetically engineered drug was human insulin, chemically identical to naturally produced insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. This was a manufacturing and scale advantage more than an efficacy advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.

The announcement triggered a race for human insulin. Novo attempted to chemically modify pig insulin to match human insulin, which proved to be a flop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. Nordisk, however, focused on building its recombinant DNA capabilities rather than rushing a human insulin product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. By 1984, Nordisk became the number three global player in insulin, and by the late 1980s, its global market share was 20%, closing in on Novo's 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>.

### The [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] Merger (1989)
In January 1989, Novo and Nordisk, now on more equal footing, merged into [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>. The merger combined both their operating companies and respective foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>. Novo held 62% and Nordisk 38% of the merged entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:49">[01:32:49]</a>. The new company commanded roughly $1 billion in insulin revenue and 50% global market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>.

The merger was driven by the increasing importance of scale in the pharmaceutical industry for R&D, clinical trials, approvals, and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:42">[01:34:42]</a>.

## Healthcare Industry Value Chain in the US
The US healthcare market is highly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. The simplified transaction of a patient buying a drug involves many parties:
*   **Manufacturer:** Develops the drug and conducts R&D and clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.
*   **Distributors/Wholesalers:** Buy, warehouse, and distribute drugs from manufacturers to pharmacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:13">[01:26:13]</a>.
*   **Pharmacies:** Sell drugs to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>. Major players like CVS Caremark and Walgreens Boots Alliance have vertically integrated with PBMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.
*   **Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs):** Negotiate discounts (rebates) with manufacturers on behalf of insurance companies and employers, managing pharmacy benefits for most Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>. Three major PBMs cover about 80% of the market: Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, and OptumRx (owned by UnitedHealth Group) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. PBMs effectively act as gatekeepers for drug access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>. Rebates can be very high, with Eli Lilly claiming they accounted for 75% of insulin's sticker price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>.
*   **Insurance Companies/Healthcare Plans:** Pay for most of the drug cost for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>.
*   **Employers:** Often involved in providing insurance plans to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:55">[01:24:55]</a>.

This multi-middleman system makes it difficult for market signals to flow and for the end consumer to be treated as the direct customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>.

### Insulin Pricing Controversy
Around 2015, the price of insulin became a scandal, with US officials alleging that [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] had increased prices over 600% between 2001 and 2019, in line with competitors like Sanofi and Eli Lilly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:02">[02:13:02]</a>. While net prices decreased after 2017 due to rebates, the list prices remained high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:13:51]</a>.

The insulin market's profitability was eroded by regulation (price caps), the emergence of biosimilars (generics for biologics), and reduced demand due to the rise of [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1 Agonists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:14">[02:41:14]</a>.

## [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1 Agonists]] and the Future of Diabetes/Weight Loss Treatment

### Discovery of [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1 Agonists]]
Research into [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1 Agonists]] began in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>. Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, a scientist at [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], was instrumental in this research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>. The challenge was that natural [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1]] stays active in the body for only about 5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>.

Knudsen developed liraglutide, a [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1]] analog with a fatty acid grafted onto the molecule, extending its half-life to 13 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>. This made it a potential once-a-day drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:32">[01:50:32]</a>.

Concurrently, two American researchers in the VA hospital system discovered that a hormone in the venom of the Gila monster lizard was also a long-lasting [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1]] analog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>. Daniel Drucker, a researcher at the University of Toronto, also experimented with this venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:54">[01:52:54]</a>.

### First [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1]] Drugs to Market
*   **Byetta (Eli Lilly, 2005):** The world's first [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1]] analog drug, derived from Gila monster venom, came to market for type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>. It required two injections per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.
*   **Victoza ([[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], 2010):** [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]]'s liraglutide (marketed as Victoza) received FDA approval for diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:05">[02:08:05]</a>. It was a once-a-day injection and quickly became a "Blockbuster" drug, achieving over $1 billion in annual sales in its first full year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>. A significant portion of its use was off-label for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:37">[02:09:37]</a>.
*   **Saxenda ([[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], 2014):** A slightly higher-dose version of liraglutide, Saxenda, was approved for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>. It resulted in an average of 8% BMI reduction, just shy of the "magic number" of 10% for significant market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:01">[02:12:01]</a>.

### The [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | Semaglutide]] Revolution
*   **Ozempic ([[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], 2018):** [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] introduced semaglutide, a next-generation [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1]] analog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:51">[02:14:51]</a>. Ozempic, its diabetes brand, requires only once-weekly injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:31">[02:15:31]</a>.
*   **Wegovy ([[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], 2021):** The official weight loss version of semaglutide, Wegovy, was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:18">[02:19:18]</a>. It is twice as effective as liraglutide for weight loss, yielding 15%+ BMI reduction, crossing the 10% threshold considered impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:54">[02:15:54]</a>.

[[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | Semaglutide]] works by causing the natural [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1]] in the gut to signal satiety to the brain and slow digestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:46">[02:16:46]</a>. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, and constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:41">[02:17:41]</a>.

The market for [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1]] drugs has exploded, with demand significantly outpacing supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:37">[02:19:37]</a>. In 2023, [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]]'s revenue was up 30% year-on-year, with 69% of revenue coming from [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1 Agonists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>.

### Competition and Future Directions
Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, a dual [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1]] and GIP agonist, is another significant development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:25">[02:35:25]</a>. It is marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:50">[02:35:50]</a>. Eli Lilly also has a triple agonist, retatrutide, in its pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:58">[02:36:58]</a>. [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] has its own next-generation [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1]] drug called CagriSema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:35">[02:36:35]</a>.

The list price for [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | Ozempic]] (diabetes) is over $1,000 per month and [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | Wegovy]] (weight loss) is over $1,300 per month in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:30">[02:27:30]</a>. This compares to $147 for [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | Ozempic]] in Canada and $93 in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:47">[02:27:47]</a>. Medicare Part D is legally prohibited from covering weight loss drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53">[02:30:53]</a>.

Beyond weight loss, [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | semaglutide]] is being studied for treating cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, and kidney disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:19">[02:26:19]</a>.

## Pharmaceutical Industry Landscape

### Cost of Drug Development
The average cost to bring a drug to market is $2.5 billion today, up from $40 million (inflation-adjusted) in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:03">[03:11:03]</a>. Phase three clinical trials alone account for 29% of a drug's R&D spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:36">[01:56:36]</a>. Only about 8% of drugs that enter preclinical studies make it to approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:17">[01:57:17]</a>.

Pharmaceuticals is a high-risk, high-return industry; the top 10% of drugs that make it to market provide half of all profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:02">[03:13:02]</a>. Many approved drugs do not even earn back their R&D costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:02">[03:13:02]</a>.

### Concentration and Specialization
The pharmaceutical industry has seen significant consolidation, with large companies like GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:42">[01:34:42]</a>. Scale is crucial for R&D, trials, approval, and market negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:42">[01:34:42]</a>.

While many Pharma companies have diversified into specialty drugs for rare diseases with high price tags, [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] has maintained its focus on metabolic disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:28">[02:57:28]</a>. They are the second largest Pharma company by market cap but only 20th by revenue, reflecting optimism about future profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">[02:57:07]</a>.

### Pharma's "Power"
In the context of Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers:
*   **Cornered Resource (Patents):** [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] holds patents on [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | semaglutide]] until 2032 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:47">[02:45:47]</a>. Patents also extend to delivery mechanisms (e.g., insulin pens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:25">[02:47:25]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies:** Apply across R&D, production, and go-to-market efforts in the pharmaceutical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:42">[02:48:42]</a>.
*   **Branding:** While not typical for Pharma, [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | Ozempic]] has achieved significant brand recognition and viral word-of-mouth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:31">[02:49:31]</a>.
*   **Switching Costs:** Once a drug works for a patient, there's a strong disincentive to switch, especially for chronic conditions where stopping treatment can reverse benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:16">[02:51:16]</a>.
*   **Process Power:** While not explicitly mentioned, the complex engineering to protect molecules and create oral versions (like [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | Rybelsus]]) demonstrates a high level of expertise and process optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:56">[02:53:56]</a>.

The US healthcare system's incentives are misaligned due to short time horizons for private insurers (average job tenure of 3.7 years), encouraging focus on short-term costs rather than long-term preventative care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>. Medicare, covering those over 65, faces the long-term costs of chronic diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1 Agonists]] market, pioneered by [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], is seen as a new "super cycle" in Pharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:18">[03:31:18]</a>. The sheer demand for these drugs, combined with high barriers to entry, suggests room for multiple successful competitors like Eli Lilly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:32">[03:33:32]</a>.

The bull case for [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] hinges on [[glp1_agonists_for_diabetes_and_weight_loss | GLP1 Agonists]] continuing to be a major innovation and the company maintaining its leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:18">[03:33:18]</a>. The bear case involves potential health risks (e.g., loss of lean muscle mass, or other as yet undiscovered issues like suicidal thoughts) or a failure to sustain long-term efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:48">[03:35:48]</a>.

The story of [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] exemplifies the power of long-term focus and compounding innovation within a specific, massive market, despite initial niche status and industry pressures to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:40">[02:57:40]</a>.

The landscape of software and data storage has undergone a significant transformation over the past two decades. A core theme in this evolution is the understanding that not all software is created equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Historical Context: Databases in 2000

In 2000, databases constituted the largest sector of [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The aggregate enterprise value of companies primarily deriving revenue from databases was approximately a trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Exponential Growth of Data

A key driver of this transformation is the exponential [[growth_and_significance_of_data_storage | growth]] of [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | data]]. Annually, more [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | data]] is produced than in all prior years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This ever-increasing volume of [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | data]] necessitates new storage solutions and methods for processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The future will see even more [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | data]] gathered through sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Bill Gates's Vision

Around 2000, Bill Gates, in response to a question from Meg Whitman about whether all interesting innovations were complete, articulated a profound vision for the future of [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | data]] and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>:

> "Do you realize how barbaric it is the way we make decisions? In the future, we will have all this [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | data]] stored, and machines will analyze the [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | data]] and help us make better decisions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>

Gates envisioned a future where machines, by analyzing [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | data]], would assist in critical areas such as:
*   Diagnosing illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Educating dyslexic children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Maintaining aircraft engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

This vision highlighted a shift towards [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | data]]-driven decision-making, emphasizing the need for robust [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | data]] storage and analytical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Shift to Cloud Databases

This understanding led to a strong belief that the entire database market would be fundamentally remade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The key transformation predicted was its recreation in the [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | cloud]], purpose-built for [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | cloud]] environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

A significant focus has been placed on the [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | cloud]] infrastructure layer and the enablement required to help enterprises transition to the [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | cloud]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This strategic focus has proven to be highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

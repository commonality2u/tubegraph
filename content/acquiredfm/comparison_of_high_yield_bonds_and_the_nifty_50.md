Investment strategies can fall into pitfalls when they become rigid or fail to consider the fundamental relationship between price and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is exemplified by contrasting two distinct approaches: investing in [[high_yield_bonds_and_investment_strategies | high yield bonds]] (also known as [[risks_and_rewards_of_investing_in_low_rated_bonds | low rated bonds]] or "junk bonds") and holding the "Nifty 50" stocks during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

## The High Yield Bond Approach: Embracing the Undesirable

When the speaker began managing money in the bond department at Citibank, they were tasked with understanding and starting a fund for [[high_yield_bonds_and_investment_strategies | high yield bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. At the time, this was a "backwater" area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, with most investment organizations having strict rules against buying bonds rated below 'A' or 'Triple B' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The prevailing sentiment was "no, we don't do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. However, this lack of competition was seen as an advantage, akin to attending an auction with no other bidders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Mike Milken's Influence and Early Insights
[[History and Evolution of Junk Bonds | Mike Milken]] had an early interest in [[risks_and_rewards_of_investing_in_low_rated_bonds | low rated bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His understanding was influenced by a book called "Hickman," which analyzed bond experiences from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Milken's key finding from this book was that the lower a bond's rating, the higher its *actual* rate of return, not just its promised yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Despite defaults and bankruptcies, even through the Great Depression, the excess yield received was sufficient to offset credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Historical Perceptions and the "Aha!" Moment
In that era, issuing a [[risks_and_rewards_of_investing_in_low_rated_bonds | low rated bond]] was nearly impossible; they were termed "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Moody's manual even defined a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This stance implied that such bonds were "not proper for investment regardless of price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

The speaker's "aha moment" came around 1981 or 1982 when a reporter questioned how one could invest in bonds knowing some would default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The immediate analogy that came to mind was life insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>:

*   **Risk Awareness**: Defaults are an expected part of the business, not a shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Risk Analysis**: The risk can be analyzed and assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Risk Diversification**: Risks are diversified across a broad portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Well-Paid for Risk**: The premium (or yield) received is ample compensation for the risk taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Applying these principles, investing in [[high_yield_bonds_and_investment_strategies | high yield bonds]] allowed for steadily and safely making money by investing in what were perceived as "the worst public companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## The Nifty 50 Approach: Believing in Infallibility

In stark contrast, the investment philosophy during the speaker's early career at Citibank's investment research department in 1969 was centered on the "Nifty 50" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. These were considered the "best and fastest growing companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The core beliefs underpinning investment in the Nifty 50 were:
*   Nothing bad could ever happen to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   There was "no price too high" to pay for these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### The Downfall of Overvaluation
This "no price too high" stance was the polar opposite of the "not appropriate for investment" view of [[high_yield_bonds_and_investment_strategies | high yield bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. However, both stances were ultimately proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Investors who bought the Nifty 50 around 1969 and held them for five years often "lost almost all their money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The primary reason for these losses was that the companies had been priced too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While the normal post-war P/E ratio for the S&P 500 was around 16, many Nifty 50 stocks were selling at P/E ratios between 60 and 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Examples of Nifty 50 companies and their struggles include:
*   **IBM**: While not going bankrupt, its dominance was challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Xerox**: Lost its market to imports and had to find a new business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Patterns**: A consumer company that suffered due to changing trends, as fewer people sewed their own clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The concept of disruption was largely ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, and competitive moats were considered inviolable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The simple thinking failed to account for competitors who could undercut pricing, as in the case of Xerox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Many Nifty 50 companies experienced losses of over 90% from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Importance of Price in Investing

The contrast between the Nifty 50 and [[high_yield_bonds_and_investment_strategies | high yield bonds]] highlights a crucial investment lesson:
*   For the Nifty 50, the belief was "no price too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   For [[high_yield_bonds_and_investment_strategies | high yield bonds]], the perception was "no price low enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Both extreme stances were flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. While the Nifty 50 were indeed good companies, their prices were too high to make sense as investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, leading to significant losses for those who failed to consider [[market_pricing_and_investment_pitfalls | market pricing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Conversely, perceived undesirable assets like [[high_yield_bonds_and_investment_strategies | high yield bonds]], when purchased at appropriately low prices that compensate for risk, could generate steady and safe returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This demonstrates the critical role of [[value_investing_versus_growth_investing | valuation]] and open-mindedness in investment success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

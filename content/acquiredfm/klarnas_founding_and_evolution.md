Klarna, a company best known for its "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) service, was founded 19 years ago in Stockholm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It has since grown to serve 150 million consumers globally, empowering 2 million payments daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Klarna's ambition extends to playing a broader role in the payments landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Founding Insights and Early Days

Sebastian Siemiątkowski, Klarna's co-founder and CEO, was inspired by the founder of [[history_and_evolution_of_ikea | Ikea]] and Richard Branson's book about Virgin, having dreamt of starting a company from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. His direct inspiration for Klarna came from an unexpected job at an account receivables factoring/collection company in 2003, during a low economy after the dot-com bubble burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

In this role, he noticed a significant opportunity with early e-commerce companies in Sweden. While traditional mail-order businesses offered a "bill me" or "buy now, pay later" option, online retailers often relied on credit or debit card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. In Sweden, where debit cards were prevalent and credit cards were often viewed as "dangerous" due to debt concerns, consumers felt online purchases were risky using direct card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Siemiątkowski realized that providing a "buy now, pay later" option would offer safety and trust to consumers, allowing them to receive and inspect products before paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This insight led to the founding idea: enabling individuals to pay later for purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Initial Business Model and Profitability

Klarna's initial offering was an "open invoice payment method" where consumers could buy something and pay within 15 to 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The company operated on a factoring model: they underwrote and acquired accounts receivables from merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

Remarkably, Klarna achieved profitability quickly without needing significant external funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This was because merchants, especially smaller e-commerce businesses, were more concerned with offloading risk and administration than immediate cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Klarna offered to buy these receivables, take the risk, and handle administration, but only paid merchants three weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Combined with many consumers paying earlier than the due date, this created a positive cash flow for Klarna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Merchants effectively funded Klarna for the first few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### The "Buy Now, Pay Later" Term

The term "buy now, pay later" itself was popularized later. Siemiątkowski initially believed the term originated from Afterpay in Australia, but later found a Financial Times article from 2013-2015 that had already used the phrase to describe Klarna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Market Expansion and Challenges

Klarna's initial success in Sweden led to expansion in the Nordics (Norway, Finland), driven by merchant demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The next strategic markets were Germany and the Netherlands, which had a strong tradition of invoice-based payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

The US and UK markets posed a challenge, as Klarna initially believed the prevalence of credit cards meant "there's no need for our product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. However, a UK team, ignoring CEO advice, discovered a massive opportunity for small-ticket BNPL in 2014-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

This shift was driven by a new generation of card users primarily using debit cards, often lacking or disliking credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. A 2014 McKinsey report titled "New Frontiers in credit card segmentation tapping unmet consumer needs" identified "self-aware avoiders" – a segment of the US population who disliked credit card practices, sought transparency, and desired structured payment plans, essentially describing the future BNPL user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

Credit card companies' business models, focused on revolving debt and high interest, made it difficult for them to adapt to an interest-free installment model that generates less revenue but is better for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This represents an "innovator's dilemma," where incumbents struggle to embrace a lower-margin product that serves a new market segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

## Strategic Pivots and Consumer Focus

Between 2010 and 2015, Klarna attempted to [[business_strategy_and_diversification_at_plaid | compete with Stripe and Adyen]] on the acquiring and Payment Service Provider (PSP) side with "Klarna checkout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. While highly successful in the Nordics, processing over 50% of online transactions there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>, international expansion was difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. The dominance of [[business_strategy_and_diversification_at_plaid | Shopify]] in the US, which developed its own checkout system, further blocked Klarna's entry point into that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

In 2015, recognizing they couldn't win on the merchant side globally, Klarna made a significant pivot to focus on the consumer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.

### The Digital Financial Assistant Vision

Klarna's new direction was rooted in a long-term vision of becoming a "digital financial assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. This assistant would autonomously manage and optimize a user's finances, moving them to better deals (e.g., mortgages) with minimal user input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. This future implied the end of "excess profits" in the banking industry, as barriers to switching banks would disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

To achieve this, two critical factors were identified:
1.  **Global Scale**: Being global rather than local is crucial for volume and size in this future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
2.  **Data**: The more data Klarna has (with consumer consent) about transactions and financial lives, the better it can provide valuable advice and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

Klarna had a unique advantage here: from its inception as an "open invoice" business, it collected SKU-level data on every purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. Unlike traditional networks like [[challenges_and_evolution_of_plaids_technology_and_partnerships | Visa]] or Mastercard, which typically only receive transaction amounts and merchant names, Klarna knows exactly what items were bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. This detailed data, combined with Klarna's third-party network structure (unlike a four-party network), allows for faster innovation and value delivery to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.

### Competing in the US and In-Store Expansion

When Klarna entered the US market around summer 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, Afterpay had already gained significant momentum, notably by signing Urban Outfitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. Klarna faced the "don't get fired for choosing IBM" dilemma, where merchants preferred the perceived market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

To counter this, Klarna focused on winning the consumer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. They developed a feature within their app that allowed users to shop with Klarna even where it wasn't directly integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. By using a built-in browser and generating one-time virtual Visa cards, consumers could effectively use Klarna's BNPL service on any website, including those like [[amazons_founding_and_early_years | Amazon]] that weren't direct partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. This approach also allowed Klarna to continue collecting SKU-level data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

This strategy led to higher app downloads than Afterpay, enabling Klarna to claim consumer preference and eventually sign major US retailers like Sephora and Macy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. This "everywhere" strategy extended to in-store experiences, such as through the use of cards, despite the challenge of not always capturing SKU-level data in those transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>.

Today, debit payments account for about 35% of Klarna's volume, with an ambition for it to reach 50/50 online and 80% debit in-store, promoting a "healthier" spending proportion for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

## Klarna and the Future of AI

Klarna has shifted its focus to becoming a more cost-efficient company, aiming for "a revenue line that goes up and a cost curve that goes down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as a key enabler of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

Klarna is actively integrating AI across its operations to "do more with less," leveraging natural attrition rather than mass layoffs to manage headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. A notable implementation of AI has been in customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. By deploying AI to handle customer inquiries, Klarna achieved two major breakthroughs:
1.  Customer satisfaction with AI interactions became on par with human agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
2.  The AI handled two-thirds of customer service tasks, drastically reducing the workload for human agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>.

Klarna shared these results to highlight the real-world implications of AI on job roles, encouraging politicians and society to consider the future impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

The company believes that within 6 to 12 months, "Tigers" – companies that deeply integrate AI into their core operations – will emerge, accelerating ahead in their industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. These companies will achieve significantly higher revenue per employee (e.g., $5-10 million) and innovate much faster than traditional incumbents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>. This will lead to a "massive Revival of fintech" and other industries, as agile, AI-driven companies outmaneuver slower, legacy organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

The Reva 128 was a pivotal moment in [[Nvidias history and evolution 20062022 | Nvidia's]] history, marking a critical "reset" for the company and setting the stage for its future dominance in [[Nvidias technological advancements and products | graphics processing]] and [[Nvidia and the AI revolution | AI]].

## A Company on the Brink

Founded in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:34">[04:45:34]</a>, [[Nvidias history and evolution 20062022 | Nvidia]] was initially the only consumer 3D graphics company ever created, focused on transforming the PC into an accelerated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:34">[04:47:34]</a>. However, its initial architectures (MV1 and MV2) were based on forward texture mapping and curves, which proved to be the "completely wrong answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:34">[04:37:34]</a>.

By 1997, [[Nvidias history and evolution 20062022 | Nvidia]] was in a precarious position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:29">[03:02:29]</a>:
*   Microsoft had rolled out DirectX, which was fundamentally incompatible with [[Nvidias history and evolution 20062022 | Nvidia's]] existing architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:19">[05:06:19]</a>.
*   Thirty competitors had entered the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:49">[05:14:49]</a>.
*   The company had only months of cash left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:17">[03:20:17]</a>.
*   Employees were "running out of hope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:27">[04:46:27]</a>.

This period, particularly 1997, was described as [[Nvidias history and evolution 20062022 | Nvidia's]] "best moment" because their backs were against the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:40">[05:38:40]</a>.

## The Reva 128 Gamble

Facing near-death, [[Nvidias history and evolution 20062022 | Nvidia]] decided to embrace DirectX rather than fight it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:58">[05:50:58]</a>. The goal was to build the best possible hardware for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:04">[05:56:04]</a>.

The Reva 128 was engineered as:
*   The world's first fully hardware-accelerated pipeline for rendering 3D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21">[06:01:21]</a>.
*   A massive chip, the largest ever imagined at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:59">[06:24:59]</a>.
*   Utilizing the fastest memories available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:10">[06:29:10]</a>.
*   Designed with a cost point substantially higher than competitors would dare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:53">[06:40:53]</a>.

### Betting the Company
A critical decision for the Reva 128 was to commission the production run sight unseen, testing the entire chip in simulation rather than waiting for a physical prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:18">[03:27:18]</a>. This was a direct consequence of having only six months of cash left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:24">[09:01:24]</a>.

Jensen Huang, [[Nvidias history and evolution 20062022 | Nvidia's]] founder and CEO, convinced his team the chip would be perfect, because if it wasn't, the company would be out of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:37">[09:15:37]</a>. This confidence stemmed from using an emulator (bought from a company called iOS that was shutting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:22">[08:04:22]</a>) to virtually prototype the chip and run the entire software stack, including drivers and games, in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:15">[09:22:15]</a>. This process of pre-fetching and simulating everything is a core part of [[Nvidias strategic evolution and AI dominance | Nvidia's]] philosophy to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:17">[11:46:17]</a>.

> "The plan that companies normally go through which is you know build the chip write the software fix the bugs tape out the new chip so on so forth that that method wasn't going to work and so the question is if we only had 6 months and you get to tape out just one time then obviously you're going to tape out a perfect chip so I so I remember having conversation with our leaders and they said but Jensen how do you know it's going to be perfect and I said I know it's going to be perfect because if it's not we'll be out of business and so let's make it perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:52">[08:50:52]</a>

Despite supporting only 8 of the 32 DirectX blend modes, the company launched the Reva 128 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a> and convinced the market and developers to use only those eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:08">[03:48:08]</a>.

## Lasting Impact and Philosophy

The Reva 128 was a commercial success, correctly identifying a large "enthusiast market" in the PC industry willing to buy the best performing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:07">[07:27:07]</a>. This segment of the market still exists today, especially for technologies like 3D graphics, which are "never good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:02">[07:40:02]</a>. This "sustainable technology opportunity" ensures that [[Nvidias technological advancements and products | technology]] can keep improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

The strategic lessons learned from the Reva 128 experience influenced [[Nvidias strategic evolution and AI dominance | Nvidia's]] approach to product development and market entry for decades:
*   **Anticipate Opportunity**: The company's job is to "look around corners" and position itself "near opportunities" even if the exact timing or nature isn't clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:43">[04:29:43]</a>. This was seen with the early investment in [[Nvidias technological advancements and products | CUDA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:29">[12:08:29]</a> and the acquisition of Mellanox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:40">[39:41:40]</a> for data center networking.
*   **"Zero Billion Dollar Market"**: [[Nvidias strategic evolution and AI dominance | Nvidia]] prefers to serve a need that hasn't fully emerged, operating in "zero billion dollar markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:19">[46:32:19]</a>. This allows them to shape the market as it develops and avoid direct competition in established areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32:13">[47:32:13]</a>. Examples include PC gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:58">[47:48:58]</a>, design workstations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:56:53">[47:56:53]</a>, supercomputing democratization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>, and [[Nvidia and the AI revolution | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:06">[48:15:06]</a>.
*   **Platform Company**: From its earliest days, [[Nvidias strategic evolution and AI dominance | Nvidia]] envisioned itself as a platform company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:59:16">[50:59:16]</a>. The initial architecture, called UDA (which became [[Nvidias technological advancements and products | CUDA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:06:51">[51:06:51]</a>), was designed for developers to program to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:19">[51:30:19]</a>. This commitment to a consistent, architecturally compatible platform across all its accelerators is an "unnegotiable rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:45:00">[53:45:00]</a>, fostering an ecosystem of developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:17:09">[49:17:09]</a>.

The desperation during the Reva 128 development led to innovative and efficient design practices, which became standard for [[Nvidias technological advancements and products | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:00">[56:26:00]</a>. The success of the Reva 128 and the subsequent emergence of killer apps like Quake (using OpenGL) and Unreal (by Sweeney) for consumer 3D graphics were crucial moments of "luck" that allowed [[Nvidias history and evolution 20062022 | Nvidia]] to establish itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:50:00">[58:50:00]</a>.

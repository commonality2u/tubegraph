Slack Connect is a strategic feature developed by Slack to facilitate external collaboration, allowing companies to communicate directly with partners and clients in shared channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. This feature is seen as a way to replace traditional email conversations within the sales and partnership process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

## Growth and Strategic Importance
Slack Connect has shown significant growth, with endpoints increasing from 380,000 to 520,000 in a single quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. This growth was likely a key factor in the [[salesforce_acquisition_of_slack | Salesforce acquisition of Slack]], making Slack more attractive as a "work social network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.

For Slack, Connect serves as a "try before you buy" mechanism, allowing potential customers to experience the product's benefits firsthand when a partner or client requests a shared channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. This exposure can lead to wider adoption and conversion to paid Slack users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. In practice, companies like Pioneer Square Labs use shared channels to facilitate transitions when spinning out new ventures, maintaining a collaborative bridge with new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

Initially, Slack primarily functioned as an internal communication tool, with email serving for external interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. However, there's a growing push for Slack to become an equally effective external collaboration tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. This aligns philosophically with Salesforce's approach, which is an internal tool for managing external communications and deal statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

## The "Email Killer" Narrative
Slack has long "danced with whether or not they're an email killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, despite a 2013 tweet suggesting otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. The idea of "killing email" resonates strongly with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>, offering a clear and simple message, unlike more abstract positioning statements like "where work happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.

## Comparison to Microsoft Teams
The threat of [[comparison_between_slack_and_microsoft_teams | Microsoft Teams]] significantly impacted Slack's stock valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Microsoft actively highlighted Teams' user numbers, often directly comparing them to Slack's in presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. While Teams boasts a much larger user base (around 100 million compared to Slack's 12 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, this comparison can be misleading. Teams is designed as a hub for Microsoft's ecosystem, often bundling with Office 365, inflating its active user count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Its architecture is less flexible for creating continuous sub-channels within large organizations compared to Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Microsoft's aggressive stance against Slack stemmed from the perception that Slack, as a platform that could integrate with best-in-class software, threatened Outlook and the entire Microsoft suite by potentially replacing email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. In contrast, Zoom, while popular for video calls, doesn't pose the same platform threat to Microsoft's core products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

## Future Outlook
A potential "F scenario" for Slack within Salesforce could involve failing to integrate the products effectively, resulting in Slack becoming "more like Salesforce" than the reverse, and alienating its core startup and high-growth users who might then move to newer collaboration tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a>. This is partly due to the perception that Salesforce's past acquisitions (like Quip or Heroku) haven't always maintained their innovation or market leadership after being acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>.

However, an "A+ scenario" for Slack within Salesforce could see it significantly boost its revenue growth by leveraging Salesforce's massive sales force to penetrate larger enterprise markets, gaining a "Microsoft-like" seal of approval for large-scale adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:53">[02:39:53]</a>. Furthermore, it could catalyze a broader "anti-Microsoft alliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>, positioning Salesforce as a central, credible distribution channel for other "best-of-breed" SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>. In this scenario, Slack Connect could humanize the sales process and build strong network effects by fostering links between companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:50">[02:59:50]</a>.

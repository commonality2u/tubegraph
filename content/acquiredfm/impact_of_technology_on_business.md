From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The podcast *Acquired* focuses on [[impact_of_technological_shifts_on_business_and_investing | great technology companies]] and the strategies behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Technology is seen as anything that enhances human productivity, such as the wheel or navigational instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>.

## Evolution of Security and Compliance

Security and compliance have significantly evolved, becoming "table stakes" for B2B companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. What was once viewed with perplexity by venture capitalists in 2018 is now essential, with many startups in the YC batch using services like Vanta to obtain SOC 2 reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Security reports help companies:
*   Unlock new markets, including international, enterprise, healthcare, and regulated industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Drive revenue growth from secure, trusted sources, especially crucial in the 2022 funding environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   Move upmarket faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Prove credibility and establish themselves as reliable business partners, even without the tenure of established competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Large companies recognize that their security is only as strong as their vendors' security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Increased scrutiny is expected to lead to higher expectations for startups over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Internet's Effect on Markets and Distribution

The internet has profoundly changed markets, enabling:
*   **Larger Demand**: The demand for mainstream artists like Taylor Swift, considered the "first really, really big internet rockstar," is "larger than you can ever imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This contrasts with past eras where labels selected a limited number of bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Niche Markets**: The internet allows for the existence of niches, enabling "way more artists that can make a living today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Disintermediation**: There's a reduction of power for middlemen, such as labels in the music industry, leading to more value accruing directly to creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Wider Distribution**: The most popular artists achieve "way more distribution" and "way more touchpoints" through various internet channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Information Flow**: [[Impact of social media on markets | Social media]] platforms like Twitter facilitate rapid dissemination of information and allow people to gauge "what the general consensus is around something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. However, the shift towards video-based platforms like TikTok makes information consumption less efficient compared to text-based platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Technology's Role in Business Transformation

Technology can transform established sectors by enhancing operational efficiency and market reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

### Walmart as an Applied Technology Company
Walmart is cited as an example of an applied technology company, which transformed retail through technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. By applying technology to its supply chain, Walmart achieved greater efficiency than traditional retailers, enabling lower costs and prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. This allowed them to "get more customers" and fundamentally reshape their financial statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.

### NVIDIA and Strategic Bets
NVIDIA's success is attributed to its CEO, Jensen Huang, making three "bet the company" decisions on future technologies:
1.  Shipping a graphics card designed entirely in emulation, without physical testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.
2.  A significant investment in programmable shaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
3.  A seven-year investment in AI and CUDA (their developer ecosystem) before the market was fully mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

These strategic bets, especially the investment in AI, positioned NVIDIA to capitalize on the "AI Renaissance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, validating early investors who believed in AI's transformative potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

### AI's Emerging Business Cases
Recent advancements like DALL-E 2, GPT-3, and Chat GPT are seen as "amazing proof of concepts" that are unlocking new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Companies like Mutiny are already using GPT-3 for dynamic website copy rewriting, demonstrating early business use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. While the full scope of applications is still emerging, the stateful nature of Chat GPT indicates a significant shift in how users interact with AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.

### The iPhone and Application Ecosystem
The iPhone was immediately recognized as a device that would change everything due to its physical form factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. The launch of the App Store, though not immediately obvious in its full potential for services like on-demand car services, enabled a "money fountain" for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. This highlights how new platforms can create entirely new markets and business models.

## Business Strategy in a Technological Landscape

Technology influences business strategy by enabling new models and requiring specific trade-offs.

### Brex's Dual Innovation Strategy
Brex exemplifies a company with "two massive innovations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>:
1.  **Corporate Card for Startups**: They were the first to offer a modern, flexible corporate card product with good underwriting and available credit to startups, addressing a need unmet by traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.
2.  **Spend Management for Enterprises**: As their startup clients matured, Brex expanded into spend management for large enterprises, with built-in compliance and controls at the start of the process, rather than the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>. This automation leads to significant productivity savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.

### Considerations for Tech-Enabled Businesses
When evaluating tech-enabled businesses, it's crucial to assess:
*   What technology is being used for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.
*   How it improves the financial statements at maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   Whether it consolidates back-office operations to lower cost structures and improve margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>.
*   Whether it enables better distribution and more revenue with the same costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

Some "tech-enabled" offerings today may not show significant financial improvement upon closer inspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

### Adapting Business Models
[[The importance of adaptability in business models | Businesses must adapt and evolve]] to stay relevant. For example, podcasts, being an "open ecosystem," allow for sticky audiences but make growth harder due to inherent unshareability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>. This leads to a slower, cumulative growth effect where subscribers tend to stick around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>.

Podcasts like *Acquired* prioritize deep engagement with a niche audience over rapid, broad growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. This includes building strong relationships with sponsors and partners, even to the point of co-investing in their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. This model prioritizes the quality of the audience and relationships over sheer audience size, allowing for unique insights and a more valuable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Societal Impacts

### AI's Transformational Potential
The "AI Renaissance" is seen as a "complete step change in the way that we use computers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. While the specific applications are still being discovered, AI is expected to unlock a "whole world of possibilities" similar to the early days of the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

### Long-Term Business Durability
[[Impact of Technological Change on Business Durability | The impact of technological change on business durability]] is a key theme. Businesses that can innovate multiple times, like NVIDIA, or adapt to changing environments, like Sony, demonstrate resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>. The concept of "Brand Power" and "house of brands" in luxury goods, as exemplified by Bernard Arnault, illustrates the enduring value of non-tech-centric businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.

### Venture Capital's Role in Technology
[[The impact of technology on venture investments | Venture capital]] is positioned to fund "super fast growing businesses" in "gigantic markets" with significant potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:35">[01:55:35]</a>. However, some businesses are better suited for a different model, one where founders can grow modestly and profitably, taking advantage of the internet for distribution or back-office efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:10">[01:55:10]</a>. This is where entities like Tiny, which acquires profitable internet businesses, offer an alternative, especially when IPO and M&A markets are closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:40">[01:55:40]</a>.

### Reflections on Growth and Purpose
The discussion highlights that while growth is often desired, it comes with trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>. For some, like the hosts of *Acquired*, additional growth is "neutral" or even "slightly negative" if it means sacrificing core values or audience quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>. The excitement and business drivers come from deepening engagement with the right people and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. Engaging in business directly, rather than solely as journalists, provides "first-party insights" that enhance content quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>.

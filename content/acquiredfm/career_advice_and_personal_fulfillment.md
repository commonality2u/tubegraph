Finding [[investment_strategy_and_personal_suitability | an investment strategy]] that suits one's demeanor is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This principle extends beyond investing into career choices and business operations.

## Aligning Work with Personal Demeanor

When giving [[lessons_from_successful_entrepreneurs | career advice]] to students, it is recommended to seek something that plays to one's strengths, avoids weaknesses, and is enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Choosing work that is natural to one's disposition can lead to greater enjoyment, competitive advantage, and durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Having the ability to enjoy one's work is considered a great stroke of luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Anyone who has a choice and opts for a job they do not enjoy, solely for more money, is making a "world-class mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Balancing Comfort and Growth

While it's important to find work that suits one, individuals should not get too fixated on their comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. [[optimism_in_business_success | Learning and evolution]] are important aspects of personal and professional growth, encouraging continuous expansion of competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

There's a dichotomy in investing and careers: it's important to stick to what you're good at, but also essential to be open-minded and willing to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## The Role of Judgment

Ultimately, everything comes down to judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. As Charlie Munger once said, "none of this is meant to be easy; anybody thinks it's easy is stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The tasks involved are simple to describe but not easy to execute better than others, consistently, over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Developing Superior Judgment

Superior judgment often comes from "second-level thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This involves thinking at a higher level than others, differing from the consensus, and being more correct in that divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. It's an intangible quality that combines perception, knowledge advantage, insight, and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Key components of judgment include:
*   **Deep knowledge and understanding:** A clear framework of what matters and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Rationality:** The ability to think logically rather than emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Self-awareness:** Knowing one's own biases and how they might affect decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Intellectual humility:** Acknowledging the possibility of being wrong and knowing what one doesn't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Evaluating Others' Judgment and Talent

In hiring and investing, evaluating others' judgment is critical.

### Identifying "Smart Eyes" and Intuition

Firms look for "smart eyes"â€”exceptional people who grasp things better than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. These individuals understand what's important and can look beyond readily available quantitative information, possessing an intuitive understanding of complex concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Importance of Team Players

Beyond individual brilliance, team players are highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. People who can work, exchange ideas, and thrive on input from peers, lessers, and superiors are preferred over "lone wolves" or those focused solely on individual performance metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Assessing Founders in Venture Capital

In venture investment, the vast majority of the decision-making involves backing the right people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. To assess a founder's judgment, it's crucial to delve into their story and background, understanding the "why" behind their past decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Evaluating founders involves looking for:
*   **Authenticity:** Individuals who have made decisions based on their own judgment, learned, evolved, and acted on first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Passion:** Those driven by a deep understanding of a real problem and specific knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Unconventionality:** Founders who are "weirdos" or "four standard deviations from the mean" in a particular area, as startups require thinking for oneself and deep conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This is because there isn't a clear map for startups; success comes from doing things differently and better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

### The Need to Be Different

To achieve exceptional results, one cannot simply do what everyone else does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The advantage in challenging fields, like venture capital, comes from individuals who see things "differently and better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This aligns with the concept of being "uncomfortably idiosyncratic," a term used by David Swenson, the late endowment manager at Yale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Being idiosyncratic is necessary to win, even if it means being out of step with common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Even with a perfect idea, like Google's PageRank algorithm, a person who is merely "talented at conventional things" would likely not have built Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This is because building a company requires not only execution but also out-competing others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. It takes exceptional people with exceptional judgment who can attract and retain other exceptional people to build successful ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

The concept of a "solo corporation" refers to a business, or even an empire, primarily run by a single individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This model has gained prominence due to the availability of various platforms and infrastructure, allowing individuals to operate highly successful ventures without a traditional large team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Not Boring

Packy McCormick's "Not Boring" is a prime example of a solo corporation that has grown into a media and investment empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Packy describes himself as the "founder" of this entity, acknowledging the broad and evolving nature of his role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

### Origins and Growth
Not Boring began as a newsletter assignment from a writing course, with an initial goal of attracting 20 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a>. It rapidly expanded its audience:
*   From 400 people to 2,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:08:00">[57:08:00]</a>.
*   By February 2020, Packy had 956 Twitter followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:33:00">[48:33:00]</a>.
*   By October 2020, he had 12,000 Twitter followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   In February 2021, he had 22,000 Twitter followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>.
*   By June 2021, this grew to 42,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>.
*   In one month (mid-October to mid-November 2021), his Twitter following surged from 78,000 to over 106,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:04">[02:26:04]</a>.
*   The newsletter reached 88,460 subscribers, with Twitter followers exceeding 105,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:14">[01:39:14]</a>.

This growth trajectory enabled Not Boring to pivot from a potential subscription model to a successful sponsorship model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:40:00">[57:40:00]</a>. Packy aimed to achieve $1 million in revenue in 2021 solely from the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. By late 2021, Not Boring was on track to cross that target, primarily through sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### Core Strengths
Packy attributes the success of Not Boring to a combination of:
*   **Unique Voice and Whimsy:** A distinct personal flair that makes content engaging and enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional "serious business pants" approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Diligence and Research:** Despite the whimsical tone, content is backed by serious research and a strong work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Optimism and Honesty:** An optimistic outlook on technology and innovation, coupled with transparency about potential biases or mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This builds trust with an audience that values nuanced, non-dismissive takes on complex topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Audience Alignment:** The content attracts a specific type of audience member—entrepreneurs, founders, and those interested in technology and business strategy—who find value in the insights and often become direct beneficiaries or partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## Enabling Platforms and Infrastructure
The rise of solo corporations like Not Boring is heavily reliant on modern platforms and infrastructure:
*   **Substack:** Serves as the primary publishing platform, allowing Packy to focus on content creation without managing the technical backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Twitter:** A crucial distribution and engagement platform, enabling direct interaction with the audience and rapid dissemination of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **AngelList:** Crucial for [[not_boring_capital_and_venture_investing | Not Boring Capital and venture investing]], allowing Packy to manage funds and investments without a large back office or extensive legal and compliance teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. AngelList provides sophisticated infrastructure, making it seem like "AWS for a venture firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Modular Services:** The ability to "snap off a shelf" various specialized tools and services (e.g., for bookkeeping with Pilot.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, or data with PitchBook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>) eliminates the need for internal departments, championing "specialization of labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
*   **Autonomy and Control:** The solo operator retains full control over content, business strategy, and lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** Streamlined operations without the overhead of a large organization. This allows for quick pivots and responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Authenticity:** A personal brand can thrive when the creator is directly the product, fostering a unique connection with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Scalable Impact:** The content-driven model, especially when combined with [[not_boring_capital_and_venture_investing | venture investing]], can achieve significant financial returns and influence without commensurate increases in headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

### Disadvantages
*   **Reliance on Individual:** The business is highly dependent on the single operator. If the individual stops creating, the momentum slows or the business could cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. There is no large team to maintain consistency or pick up the slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Expansion into Ancillary Products:** While the core business is strong, expanding into other product lines (e.g., merchandise) can dilute the primary content focus and might not be scalable without additional resources or staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Balancing Growth and Personal Bandwidth:** Maintaining rapid growth and consistently producing high-quality content demands significant time and effort, making it challenging to plan for long-term organizational expansion or take breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## The Not Boring Flywheel
Packy conceptualized the "Not Boring Flywheel" with "Audience" at its core. This audience feeds into founders and sponsors, while the "Monday pieces" (long-form articles) drive audience growth. The content is aligned with the [[not_boring_capital_and_venture_investing | venture investing]] business, with these elements mutually reinforcing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Packy McCormick's personal prediction is that within one or two decades, there could be "multiple trillion-dollar market cap organizations that were run quote unquote by just one person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, citing Bitcoin as an existing example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

The solo corporation model represents a significant shift enabled by modern technology platforms and changing [[partnership_dynamics_in_business_and_investing | business and investing partnership dynamics]]. It leverages increased transparency and specialized tools to allow a single individual to build and operate ventures that traditionally required large teams and substantial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. While facing unique challenges, the model demonstrates the potential for individuals to achieve massive scale and impact by focusing on core strengths and leveraging external services.

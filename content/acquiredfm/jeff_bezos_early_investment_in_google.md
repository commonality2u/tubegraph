One of the most remarkable early investments made by [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Jeff Bezos]] personally was in Google, a connection facilitated by a failed [[amazons_early_history_and_founding | Amazon]] acquisition.

## The Junglee Connection

[[amazons_early_history_and_founding | Amazon]] acquired a comparison shopping site called Junglee for an estimated $150-$175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Junglee was founded by three Stanford computer science PhDs and a business executive named Ram Sriram from Netscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

After the acquisition, [[amazons_early_history_and_founding | Amazon]] required the Junglee team, based in Palo Alto, to relocate to Seattle to avoid a tax nexus in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The team found the move unfavorable, and the acquisition was considered "ill-conceived" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Within a few months, the entire Junglee team quit and returned to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Interestingly, this team later went on to found the company that would be acquired by Walmart, becoming Walmart Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Ram Sriram's Initial Google Investment

Back in Palo Alto, Ram Sriram connected with two other Stanford computer science PhDs: Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Impressed by their "BackRub PageRank thing," Sriram made the first $250,000 investment in Google and joined its board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This occurred while [[amazons_initial_public_offering_and_investor_relations | Amazon]] was already a public company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Jeff Bezos]] and Mackenzie's Investment

Approximately six months after Ram Sriram's investment, [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Jeff Bezos]] heard about Google through his continued friendly contact with Sriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Bezos]] and his then-wife Mackenzie flew to Silicon Valley and met Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Sriram's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Despite the seed round having closed months prior and venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital already circling for a Series A round, [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Bezos]] insisted on investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He demanded to invest on the "same terms" as Sriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Sriram advocated on [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Bezos]]' behalf, convincing Page and Brin to accept another $250,000 of [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Jeff]] and Mackenzie's personal money at the seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The subsequent Series A for Google, famously split between John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital, valued the company at $100 million post-money, which was considered "insane for the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Michael Moritz reportedly commented, "We've never paid so much for so little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It is estimated that the seed valuation was possibly $10 million or even lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Impact on [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Bezos']] Wealth

It is considered safe to say that [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Jeff]] and Mackenzie Bezos owned at least one percent of Google personally, even after dilution from the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Google famously went public solely on that Series A investment, not raising another venture round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

When Google IPO'd in 2004 with a $23 billion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Bezos']] shares would have been worth approximately $230 million, or a quarter-billion dollars, at IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Since then, over the next 18 years, Google's value increased by 65x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

[[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Bezos]] has never publicly commented on whether he and Mackenzie sold their Google shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, but they would not have had a chance to sell before the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This significant personal capital allowed [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Bezos]] to invest in other ventures, such as "crazy cool clocks and rocket companies" (Blue Origin) and becoming a large personal investor in Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This investment highlights the long-term impact of maintaining relationships, even after business ventures part ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

> [!INFO] Key Takeaway
> This early personal investment in Google by [[jeff_bezos_wealth_from_google_investment | Jeff]] and Mackenzie Bezos provided a substantial personal capital base, independent of his [[amazons_initial_public_offering_and_investor_relations | Amazon]] holdings, enabling future entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavors.

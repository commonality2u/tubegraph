## Founding of [[founding_of_qualcomm_and_contributions_to_the_wireless_industry | Qualcomm]] and the Wireless Opportunity

In 1980, the company Linkabit, co-founded by Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi, was acquired by MA/COM (Microwave Communications) for $25 million [01:12:31]. After five years, Jacobs, Viterbi, and five other Linkabit engineers left MA/COM due to a leadership change [02:26:00]. Recognizing that the wireless communications industry was just beginning in 1985 [02:47:00], they decided to start a new company called [[founding_of_qualcomm_and_contributions_to_the_wireless_industry | Qualcomm]], short for "Quality Communications" [06:55:00]. They intended to bring their expertise to terrestrial cell phone networks and build a dominant company in the rapidly growing industry [10:09:00].

## Early Cellular Technology: The Need for Innovation

By 1985, the cellular telephone industry had started, operating on 1G analog networks [02:58:00]. These early systems involved car phones, which were essentially high-power FM radio broadcasters requiring a running internal combustion engine for power due to battery limitations [04:17:00]. Bandwidth was severely limited, and systems cost thousands of dollars [04:52:00]. Despite these constraints, consumer demand for car phones was "insane," with multi-year waitlists [05:01:00]. Early carriers struggled to meet demand because there was no efficient use of channels [05:15:00]. In this analog system, frequencies had to be spaced far apart (e.g., 99.1, 99.3, 99.5) to avoid interference, limiting the number of simultaneous conversations a cell tower could handle to perhaps around one hundred [05:41:00].

## The Evolution of Multiple Access Techniques

To increase capacity in telecommunications, engineers developed different "multiple access" techniques to allow many users to share the same communication medium [11:45:00].

### Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
The initial approach was [[the_evolution_of_wireless_technology_and_cdma | Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)]], where each conversation was assigned its own unique frequency [12:54:00]. This is similar to how different radio stations operate on separate frequencies [05:51:00].

### Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
With the move to digital signals, [[the_evolution_of_wireless_technology_and_cdma | Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)]] emerged, which was adopted in Europe [14:51:00]. In [[the_evolution_of_wireless_technology_and_cdma | TDMA]], conversations are broken into digital packets, and users take turns transmitting packets on the same frequency in rapid succession [13:37:00]. This "time sharing" model allowed three to five times more capacity than FDMA [15:32:00].

## The [[adoption_and_impact_of_cdma_technology | CDMA]] Breakthrough

While working on a consulting project for Hughes on a mobile satellite network, the [[founding_of_qualcomm_and_contributions_to_the_wireless_industry | Qualcomm]] founders, particularly Irwin Jacobs (who studied with [[influence_of_claude_shannon_and_digital_communications_theories | Claude Shannon]] and focused on theoretical limits of signal communication), recognized the potential for an even more efficient method [10:35:00]. They developed an application of spread spectrum to allow multiple conversations to access the same channels simultaneously [11:18:00]. This technique was named [[adoption_and_impact_of_cdma_technology | Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)]] [11:29:00].

### How [[adoption_and_impact_of_cdma_technology | CDMA]] Works
[[adoption_and_impact_of_cdma_technology | CDMA]] operates by encoding each digital message with a unique code [16:59:00]. All conversations are sent simultaneously across all available channels, maximally utilizing the spectrum [17:02:00]. When the combined signal reaches the receiver, it uses the unique code to decode and reassemble the intended message, disregarding other "noise" [17:09:00]. This is analogous to multiple people speaking different languages in the same room, with each listener only understanding their specific language and filtering out others [17:50:00].

Unlike earlier methods, [[adoption_and_impact_of_cdma_technology | CDMA]] allows all messages to be layered on top of each other on the same digital wave [18:51:00]. The receiving device knows how to individually subtract and separate the desired message based on its unique encoding, even from a complex, combined signal [19:05:00]. This process is highly efficient and requires lower power, improving battery life, unlike the old car phones [20:50:00].

## The Landmark [[qualcomms_patent_strategy_and_economic_impact | CDMA Patent]]

In a brilliant strategic move, [[founding_of_qualcomm_and_contributions_to_the_wireless_industry | Qualcomm]] patented the method and technique for [[adoption_and_impact_of_cdma_technology | Code Division Multiple Access]] applied to terrestrial cellular networks in 1986 [19:47:00]. This was years before [[founding_of_qualcomm_and_contributions_to_the_wireless_industry | Qualcomm]] was directly involved in the cellular industry itself [19:52:00]. The patent, U.S. Patent number 4,901,307, is considered "one of the most valuable patents in history" [20:08:00]. Its value lies in being the first time that a system could efficiently use all available frequencies simultaneously, allowing all users to broadcast their messages whenever possible, with the technology on the receiving end to decode it [20:28:00]. This represented an incredibly efficient way to use a given medium for maximum conversations or signal transmission [21:07:00].

Investing, particularly in dynamic fields like venture capital, fundamentally relies on [[qualitative_judgments_in_venture_capital | qualitative judgments]] and human insight, areas where algorithms and simple formulas fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The ability to make discerning evaluations about the future, understand people, and deviate from conventional thinking forms the bedrock of competitive advantage in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## The Dual Nature of Investment Strategy

A successful [[investment_strategy_and_personal_suitability | investment strategy]] must align with an investor's personal demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This means finding something that plays to one's strengths, avoids weaknesses, and is enjoyable, leading to competitive advantage and durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Pursuing an unenjoyable path solely for greater financial gain is considered a "world-class mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

However, this adherence to personal suitability must be balanced with [[learning_evolution_and_openmindedness_in_investing | learning and evolution]], avoiding becoming too comfortable in one's comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### The Berkshire Episode and Technology

One critique of Warren Buffett's approach, discussed in the "Berkshire episode" podcast, is his initial complete disregard for technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While Buffett is highly intelligent and understands business, his view of technology likely centered on "science projects" where technical advantage was the sole determinant of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Many technology companies, however, thrive on "moats" (competitive advantages) similar to those in non-technology businesses, which Buffett could have understood but chose not to explore due to it being outside his comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This highlights the paradox of sticking to one's strengths while needing to be open-minded and willing to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### The Investment Conundrum

Investing presents several inherent paradoxes:
*   **Confidence vs. Prudence:** An investor must be confident enough to back "iffy" ideas and stay with them through downturns, even buying more when public securities decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Yet, this confidence must not devolve into "pig-headedness," blindly throwing good money after bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Concentration vs. Diversification:** Holdings must be concentrated enough for good ideas to make a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. However, diversification is crucial to protect against unforeseen events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## The Essence of Judgment

The field of investing is fascinating precisely because its core challenges, like making [[qualitative_judgments_in_venture_capital | qualitative judgments]] about the future, cannot be reduced to an algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This is where human insight provides a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. A computer cannot identify the next Amazon from five business plans or recognize the next Steve Jobs from five CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

> "If there's a very credible trope to be made on either side of an argument and you can always make both of them and then be stuck in the middle, ultimately everything always comes down to judgment." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>

### Sources of Judgment

Judgment is an intangible quality that is difficult to teach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. It comes from:
*   **Second-Level Thinking:** Thinking at a higher level than others, not just differently but more correctly, to diverge from consensus thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This encompasses perception, knowledge advantage, insight, and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Deep Knowledge and Understanding:** A real framework for discerning what matters and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Rationality:** The ability to think logically rather than emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Self-Awareness:** Knowing one's own biases and how they might influence decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Humility:** Recognizing the possibility of being wrong and understanding what one doesn't know, leading to seeking knowledge and others' input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Evaluating Judgment in Others

When recruiting, investors seek "smart eyes" â€“ exceptional people who intuitively grasp what's important, can go beyond quantitative data, and understand complex dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. For instance, understanding that "the cure for low oil prices is low oil prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Team players who can exchange ideas and learn from peers, superiors, and subordinates are preferred over "lone wolves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Performance is not solely based on short-term quantitative results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

In venture capital, the vast majority of the [[qualitative_judgments_in_venture_capital | investment decision-making]] revolves around understanding and backing the right founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Evaluating founders means:
*   **Understanding Their Story:** Diving deep into their background and the "why" behind their past decisions, as this cannot be faked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Evidence of Learning and Evolution:** Assessing if they've learned and evolved through their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **First Principles Thinking:** Determining if they make decisions based on first principles and are willing to go against the herd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Passion and Specific Knowledge:** Looking for passion and ideas stemming from deep, specific knowledge of a real problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Unconventionality:** Founders in startups often need to be "weirdos," operating at four standard deviations from the mean in some area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Startups lack a clear map; success comes from thinking for oneself and having strong conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The path to exceptionality requires being different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. For an investor, this means being "uncomfortably idiosyncratic," willing to be out of step with conventional wisdom to split tactics and win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Even with a brilliant idea like Google's PageRank algorithm, a mediocre or conventionally talented person would fail to build a company like Google, because success requires exceptional judgment, the ability to attract and retain other exceptional people, and the capacity to out-compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

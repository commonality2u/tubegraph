The podcast "Acquired" focuses on [[history_and_strategy_of_technology_companies | great technology companies]] and their [[corporate_strategy_and_organizational_change_in_tech_companies | stories and playbooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This includes insights into [[corporate_strategy_and_organizational_change_in_tech_companies | corporate strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, such as Benchmark's deliberate choice *not* to build an empire, contrasting with firms like Sequoia and Andreessen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Business Strategy in Venture Capital

Venture Capital (VC) firms aim to create massive outsized returns by investing in a few truly important companies each decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The subsequent challenge is to sustain these returns across different generations of partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Benchmark, a prominent VC firm, operates on the core belief that Venture Capital does not scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Their strategy involves not growing fund sizes, avoiding junior partners, platform teams, or multi-stage investing, and famously not even having a CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Despite this anti-benchmark approach to conventional scaling, they were early backers of significant [[history_and_strategy_of_technology_companies | technology companies]] across different eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Examples include:
*   **1990s e-commerce and networking**: eBay, eShop, 1-800 Flowers, Ariba, Synopsis, Juniper Networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Next Generation**: OpenTable, Zillow, Twitter, Instagram, Uber, WeWork, Snap, Riot Games, Asana, Discord, New Relic, Modern Treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Their portfolio evolved from the "eBay generation to the Uber generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### The Role of Technological Innovation in Business

The landscape of business has drastically changed due to technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. In the 1990s, businesses had different economics, with lower gross margins, smaller addressable markets, and significant distribution costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The emergence of the internet created new "arbitrage" opportunities for investors as innovations led to more interesting investable categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

In the early internet era, deals and distribution were crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. It wasn't possible to easily spin up a company on [[impact_ai_on_business_processes | AWS]] for free distribution on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Product-market fit was less organic, often driven by business development prowess rather than immediate user signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

The rise of new technologies like mobile advertising also highlights the impact of technology on business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:55">[02:43:55]</a>. Mobile advertising, particularly with the full-screen experience and enriched data like location, was correctly seen as having enormous potential, despite initial misunderstandings of its value compared to TV advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:57">[02:43:57]</a>.

### Strategic Vision and Business Pivots

The concept of "margin of safety" in investing has evolved to emphasize management and a company's ability to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:44">[03:22:44]</a>. If the pace of change is rapid, adaptability becomes the most critical [[corporate_strategy_and_organizational_change_in_tech_companies | competitive advantage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:50">[03:22:50]</a>. This means the duration of growth is more important than the short-term growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:02">[03:24:02]</a>.

Companies like eOpinions (Naval Ravikant's first company) and Friendster show the dynamic nature of early internet businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:31">[02:12:31]</a>. The shift in venture capital from "seed and startup" to "series A" investing, particularly for consumer products, was influenced by the emergence of platforms like [[impact_ai_on_business_processes | AWS]] and the growing presence of angel investors taking on early product-building risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>. This meant investors could wait for product traction and data before committing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:47">[02:11:47]</a>.

The advent of the smartphone led to the vision of it becoming a "remote control for the real world," enabling services like Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:27">[02:45:27]</a>. This highlights a shift where the job of VCs became "not to see the future but to see the present very clearly," recognizing that companies like Instagram, Uber, and Snap were already "working" based on early data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">[02:43:02]</a>.

### Specific Technologies and Their Impact

*   **Microsoft**: The original [[microsofts_business_strategies_and_market_influence | Microsoft Silicon Valley campus]] in Menlo Park was once the office of Forethought, the makers of PowerPoint, which [[microsofts_business_strategies_and_market_influence | Microsoft]] acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>. Technology Venture Investors (TVI) was notably the only VC firm to invest in [[microsofts_business_strategies_and_market_influence | Microsoft]] before its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.
*   **Palm Pilot**: This was one of the few successful companies from the pen computing era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>.
*   **e-commerce**: Early e-commerce companies in the 90s included eBay and eShop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:16">[02:19:16]</a>. Webvan, while ultimately failing, was an ambitious early attempt at an "everything store" with last-mile delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.
*   **Internet Services and Marketplaces**: eBay, originally "Auction Web," was a collection of internet services before its auction feature gained immense traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. The explosive growth of eBay demonstrated to financial markets the power of the internet to build real, profitable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a>. The success of eBay also highlighted the potential for "asset-light, high-growth, pure [[history_and_strategy_of_technology_companies | technology businesses]] in a gigantic consumer market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:18">[01:32:18]</a>.
*   **Payments**: Accept.com emerged with the idea to build an independent company to do payments on the internet, initially focusing on accepting payments for sellers on eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:58">[01:26:58]</a>. This laid the groundwork for PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>.
*   **AI and Machine Learning**: The sophistication of applying behavioral psychology and [[impact_artificial_intelligence_and_open_source_on_modern_businesses | machine learning]] to the "ruthless execution of capitalism" was not fully realized in earlier tech eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:50">[02:59:50]</a>. The potential of [[impact_ai_on_business_processes | AI]] to perform complex tasks, like Meg Whitman's role in a box, is a future aspiration for services like Pilot.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>.
*   **Open Source Software**: Benchmark investors like Peter Fenton were prominent in open-source software and bottom-up adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:06">[02:52:06]</a>.

## Evolution of Venture Capital Firms

The venture capital industry itself has seen significant changes. The number of venture capitalists has increased significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Older firms often had management companies owned and controlled by founders, limiting junior partners' control and access to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>. This often led to resentment among younger partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:16">[02:04:16]</a>.

Benchmark's "equal partnership" model means all partners have equal carry in a given fund and jointly own the management company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:43">[02:04:43]</a>. This structure fosters a "culture of unbelievable trust" because no one is incentivized to claim individual credit, forcing competitive individuals to work as a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>. This model, known as "cooperating your way to success," creates a unique dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:57">[01:50:57]</a>.

The firm's focus on "playing the game on the field" rather than managing a large organization allows partners to dedicate nearly all their time to investment decisions and supporting portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:09">[02:20:09]</a>. This approach makes board meetings less like pitches for the next funding round, as Benchmark generally does not participate in later-stage rounds, reducing conflicts of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:25">[03:36:25]</a>. This independence is a significant "asset" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:01">[03:34:01]</a>.

However, this model only works if every active General Partner brings an equal level of effort and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:42">[01:45:42]</a>. The need for constant "swagger" and the ability to take significant risks is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>. This is why partners typically retire when they can no longer commit 100% of their effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:53">[01:46:53]</a>. This demanding standard also acts as a barrier to other firms attempting to replicate their model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Periods of [[strategic_vision_and_business_pivots_in_the_tech_industry | Strategic Vision]] and Pivots

Benchmark's history includes periods of [[strategic_vision_and_business_pivots_in_the_tech_industry | strategic vision]] and pivots:

*   **Founding (1994-1997)**: Formed by partners from Technology Venture Investors (TVI) and Merrill Pickard, who sought an "equal partnership" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. They famously launched with a "premium carry" of 30%, which was highly controversial at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>.
*   **The "Imperial Era" (Early 2000s)**: After the success of Fund I (which included eBay), Benchmark temporarily abandoned some of its core tenets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:04">[02:00:04]</a>. They raised a billion-dollar fund, expanded internationally to Europe and Israel, and explored corporate partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">[02:17:59]</a>. However, this period led to missed opportunities like Google and Facebook, partly due to conflicts of interest from their expanded reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:40">[02:22:40]</a>.
*   **The "Fab Four" Era (Mid-2000s to 2017)**: Benchmark refocused on its core principles: smaller funds, early-stage investing in Silicon Valley, and a partner-driven model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:57">[02:33:57]</a>. This era was defined by the success of Fund 7 (2011), with investments in Uber, Snap, Discord, Stitch Fix, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:01">[02:46:01]</a>. This period saw them excel at Series A investing in consumer and marketplace companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>.
*   **The Transition (2017-Present)**: Newer partners like Eric Vishria, Sarah Tavel, Chetan Puttagunta, and Miles Grimshaw have joined, continuing to demonstrate the firm's ability to find "correct non-consensus" investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:43">[03:15:43]</a>. Their strategy continues to adapt, with discussions around B2B vs. consumer investing in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:15">[03:43:15]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[impact_of_technology_and_investment_on_society | impact of technology]] on business strategy is evident in the evolution of Venture Capital firms like Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Their ability to consistently identify and back successful [[history_and_strategy_of_technology_companies | technology companies]] across different generations, while adhering to a unique partnership model, underscores the importance of [[strategic_vision_and_business_pivots_in_the_tech_industry | strategic vision]], adaptability, and a deep understanding of market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a>. The rise of new technologies continues to redefine what constitutes a "correct non-consensus" bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:43">[03:15:43]</a>.

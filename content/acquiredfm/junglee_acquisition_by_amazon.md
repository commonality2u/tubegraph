The acquisition of Junglee by Amazon stands out as a unique story in Amazon's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Junglee was a comparison shopping site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> founded by three Stanford Computer Science PhDs and a business person from Netscape named Ram Sriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Acquisition and Relocation Challenges

Amazon acquired Junglee for approximately $150 to $175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Despite Junglee being based in Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, Amazon required the team to move to Seattle to avoid creating a tax nexus in California, a common concern for [[Amazon.coms Early Business Strategy and Growth | Amazon]] during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Ill-Fated Integration and Aftermath

The relocation was unsuccessful; the Junglee team disliked Seattle, and the acquisition was considered "ill-conceived from the get-go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Within a few months, the entire team quit and returned to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Ironically, this same team later went on to start a company that was acquired by Walmart, becoming Walmart Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Walmart Labs became a significant factor in Walmart's competitive presence in e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Junglee's Connection to Google

After returning to Palo Alto, Ram Sriram, the business person from Netscape and Junglee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, connected with Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two other Stanford computer science PhDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Sriram made the first angel investment in Google, putting in $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> and joining the company's board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### [[Jeff Bezos investment in Google | Jeff Bezos's Investment]]

Approximately six months after Sriram's investment, Jeff Bezos, who had maintained a friendly relationship with Sriram, learned about Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Bezos and his then-wife MacKenzie flew to Silicon Valley and met with Page, Brin, and Sriram at Sriram's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Bezos expressed a desire to invest in Google on the same terms as Sriram, even though the seed round had closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Sriram successfully convinced Page and Brin to accept another $250,000 from Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos's personal money at the original seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This seed valuation was estimated to be around $10 million or even lower, significantly less than Google's Series A valuation of $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

It is estimated that Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos owned at least one percent of Google personally, even after dilution from the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, as Google went public solely on that Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. When Google IPO'd in 2004 with a $23 billion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, their shares would have been worth an estimated $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Since then, Google's value has increased 65x over the next 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

Bezos has never publicly commented on whether he and MacKenzie sold their Google shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, but they held them at least until the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This significant personal wealth provided Bezos with substantial capital for other ventures, such as investing in various companies and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This chain of events highlights the long-lasting relationships and unexpected outcomes that can arise from business dealings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

Porsche, a globally recognized luxury automotive brand, has a complex and controversial history intertwined with Nazi Germany. The company's founder, Ferdinand Porsche, and the origins of its sibling company, Volkswagen, are deeply rooted in the Nazi regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Founding and Key Figures' Nazi Affiliations
[[History and Founding of Porsche | Ferdinand Porsche]] was a brilliant engineer who joined Daimler as chief engineer in 1906 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Despite never finishing college, he received an honorary doctorate, a title his company would later make a significant deal about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. After leaving Daimler in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, Ferdinand Porsche established his own consulting firm in 1931, which became the genesis of the Porsche company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The firm's full name, "Doctor Engineer Honoris Causa Ferdinand Porsche Konstruktionsbüro für Motoren und Fahrwagen," or "Doctor Engineer Honoris Causa Ferdinand Porsche Consulting and Design Services for Motor Vehicles company," highlighted his honorary title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

Ferdinand Porsche, along with many others in the early Porsche and [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] days, were "huge Nazis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Ferdinand himself was a "very close personal associate of Adolf Hitler" and a member of the SS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

The initial financial support for Ferdinand's consulting firm came from his son-in-law, Anton Piëch, and Adolf Rosenberger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Rosenberger, who was Jewish, was arrested by the Gestapo shortly after the company started. He eventually bribed his way out and escaped to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. During the war, Porsche and the Nazis "totally appropriated his stake" in the company, and he was "written out of history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Volkswagen's Origins and Nazi Involvement
In 1934, Ferdinand Porsche's new company secured a monumental contract: to design a small, affordable "car for the people" – a [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This vehicle would become the iconic Volkswagen Beetle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The company that commissioned and established Volkswagen was directly founded by Adolf Hitler himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

The new city built to house the Volkswagen company, known today as Wolfsburg, was created by Hitler and originally called "the city of the strength through joy car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. While Beetle production began before World War II, only about 200 units were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. During the war, all Volkswagen and Porsche operations were repurposed for military vehicle production, involving forced labor and concentration camps as part of the Nazi war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

## Post-War Rebirth and Enduring Influence
After the war, Ferdinand Porsche and Anton Piëch were arrested by the French as war criminals and imprisoned for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. Their charges included the use of forced labor involving imprisoned Jews in factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Ferdinand's son, Ferry Porsche, who had also been arrested, was released earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

The future of Volkswagen, founded by Hitler, was uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Wolfsburg ended up in British hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. The initial British plan to dismantle the factory changed when Major Ivan Hirst, the officer in charge, saw the potential in the Beetle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Recognizing the need for West Germany's economic revitalization, Hirst convinced British command to leave the factory and placed an initial order for 20,000 Beetles for military transport, effectively "restarting" Volkswagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

Meanwhile, Ferry and his sister Louise returned to Austria and started a new company, initially fixing military vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. This new Austrian company, Porsche Construction GmbH, became the basis for the development of the legendary Porsche 356 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. The 356 was based on the Beetle's architecture and used many of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

After their release, Ferdinand and Anton returned. Volkswagen, now back on its feet, offered the Porsche family a "sweetheart deal": a royalty on every Beetle sold worldwide for the German Porsche company, and exclusive rights to distribute Volkswagens in Austria and other European countries for the Austrian Porsche company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. This deal was part of a broader post-war strategy by the Western Allies to rapidly reconstitute West Germany's industrial base against the threat of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. Germany's unique tax system at the time, with a 95% marginal tax rate on industrialist profits, strongly incentivized reinvestment in production and R&D rather than profit distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. This financial arrangement provided Porsche with a steady stream of capital to invest, even enabling ventures like racing, which significantly contributed to the brand's prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

Despite their troubling origins, both Porsche and Volkswagen have seen immense success. [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] is now one of the world's largest automotive conglomerates, owning many brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Porsche, though once nearly bankrupt, has achieved a market capitalization of $115 billion as of late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:31">[02:40:31]</a>, largely due to its commitment to engineering excellence, strategic product diversification (including SUVs like the Cayenne and Macan), and a powerful [[Legacy and Brand Power of Porsche | brand]] that evokes an aspirational image, transcending its historical ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

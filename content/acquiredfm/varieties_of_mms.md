M&M's are a popular candy produced by Mars Incorporated, a company with a rich history involving product innovation and marketing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:51">[02:10:51]</a>. Initially conceived as a solution for chocolate that wouldn't melt in one's hand, M&M's have expanded into numerous varieties since their consumer launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:35">[02:08:35]</a>.

## Current Varieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

The M&M's brand offers a diverse range of flavors, with some being mainstays and others seasonal or limited editions:

*   **Milk Chocolate (Plain)**: Originally known as "plain" M&M's, this is now technically called milk chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Along with peanut, it remains a primary sales driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
*   **Peanut** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>: Another core sales driver, introduced after the original milk chocolate version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
*   **Dark Chocolate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Peanut Butter** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>: The market potential for peanut butter M&M's is thought to be limited because the sons of Forrest Mars (Forest Jr. and John Mars) grew up in England and did not fully appreciate the unique American appeal of peanut butter and chocolate together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:41">[01:53:41]</a>.
*   **Pretzel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>
*   **Almond** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>
*   **Crunchy Cookie**: This variety replaced the older "crispy" M&M's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Dark Chocolate Peanut** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>
*   **Fudge Brownie** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>
*   **Campfire S'mores** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>
*   **Caramel Cold Brew** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>

### Seasonal and Limited Editions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>

*   **Mint**: This flavor is seasonal and primarily available during holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Birthday Cake** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>

*   **Pumpkin Spice Latte** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>

## Branding and Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>

M&M's were initially slow to gain traction with consumers after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:14">[02:09:14]</a>. Mars, under the leadership of Forrest Mars, commissioned a comprehensive market study in 1950 with the Ted Bates and Company advertising agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>. This research revealed that M&M's held strong appeal for children, a significant shift from the adult-focused candy market of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:21">[02:15:21]</a>.

Recognizing that parents were the actual purchasers, Mars developed the iconic slogan, "The milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This tagline brilliantly addressed parental concerns about mess, making M&M's an attractive purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:16">[02:17:16]</a>. They further boosted their presence by sponsoring popular children's television shows like *The Mickey Mouse Club* and *Howdy Doody* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:32">[02:17:32]</a>.

By 1956, M&M's became the best-selling candy in America, surpassing even the Hershey's bar, with over $40 million in annual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:52">[02:17:52]</a>.

### The "M" Trademark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:08">[02:18:08]</a>

To combat copycats and ensure authenticity, Mars began printing a small black "M" on each candy piece, transitioning to white in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:15">[02:18:15]</a>. A second ad campaign encouraged consumers to "look for the M on every piece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>.

### Animated Characters and Color Changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:54">[02:18:54]</a>

The first animated M&M's characters debuted in a TV commercial in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>. The company has continuously updated the ratios of M&M's colors in bags to suit current tastes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:55">[03:29:55]</a>. A notable marketing campaign occurred in 1995 when Mars announced they would discontinue tan M&M's and held a public vote to choose a new color, with blue emerging as the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:01">[03:29:01]</a>. This generated significant public engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:01">[03:29:01]</a>.

## Production and History <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:52">[02:26:52]</a>

M&M's originated from Forrest Mars's observation of "drag√©es," small, candy-coated chocolates popular with soldiers during the Spanish Civil War, which prevented them from melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:13">[01:50:13]</a>. He recognized the global appeal of such a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:31">[01:50:31]</a>.

The [[Chocolate Production Process]] is complex, involving fermentation, drying, roasting, winnowing (removing shells to get nibs), pressing nibs into cocoa powder and cocoa butter, conching (grinding and smoothing), and tempering (aligning crystals for shine and snap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:29">[02:22:29]</a>. Milk chocolate, in particular, requires careful processing to prevent spoilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:33">[02:16:33]</a>.

Mars's decision to produce its own chocolate in America was a strategic move to control quality and maximize scale, despite initial skepticism from Hershey's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:15">[02:32:15]</a>. By controlling the entire production process, Mars aimed for the highest quality at competitive prices, a core principle of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:25">[02:33:25]</a>.

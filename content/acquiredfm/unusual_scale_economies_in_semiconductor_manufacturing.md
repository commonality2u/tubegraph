TSMC's strategic approach involves foregoing immediate profits in favor of future revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy aims to achieve customer retention through [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customer loyalty]] or by [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | acquiring new customers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This raises questions about whether more customers and future revenue lead to greater differential returns, which in turn leads to an examination of [[scale_economies_in_the_semiconductor_industry | scale economies]] within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While [[scale_economies_in_the_semiconductor_industry | scale economies]] are present, they are considered "pretty unusual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Key Unusual Industry Characteristics

The semiconductor industry exhibits several unique characteristics that contribute to its unusual [[scale_economies_in_the_semiconductor_industry | scale economies]]:

*   **Large, Lumpy Capital Investment**
    Establishing a new semiconductor fabrication plant (fab) requires substantial capital, often exceeding $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This represents an enormous investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

*   **Predictable Material Performance Advances (Moore's Law)**
    The industry benefits from quote-unquote predictable material performance advances, famously embodied by Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Unlike most industries, there is a relatively high assurance that making the correct [[technological_advancements_and_supplier_impacts_in_semiconductors | technology choices]] can lead to significant improvements, such as a 10x enhancement within 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This level of predictable advancement is highly unusual outside of this specific sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

*   **Supplier-Driven Technological Advantages**
    [[technological_advancements_and_supplier_impacts_in_semiconductors | Tech advantages]] in the semiconductor industry are largely driven by [[technological_advancements_and_supplier_impacts_in_semiconductors | upstream suppliers]], such as ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This reliance on external entities for critical advancements presents a difficult choice for semiconductor companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Historically, significant discussions and investments have been made around major [[technological_advancements_and_supplier_impacts_in_semiconductors | technology choices]], such as the decision regarding X-ray lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

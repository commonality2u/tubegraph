An article from the New York Times in 1995 highlighted internal politics within Silicon Valley venture firms, revealing significant resentment among younger partners regarding the distribution of rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This tension revolved around the perception that senior partners were holding onto the majority of the firm's economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:09">[03:06:09]</a>.

## The Genesis of an Idea: Robert Cagle's Vision

Robert "Bob" Cagle, then a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI), was quoted in the New York Times article stating that "today the power is much more distributed" and "nobody can claim that they are making all the money for the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. His background profoundly shaped this perspective: he grew up in Flint, Michigan, as the first in his family to attend college, graduating from General Motors University and later Stanford Business School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

After working at Boston Consulting Group, Bob was invited by Dave Marquardt to join TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:09">[02:44:09]</a>. At TVI, Bob achieved success with companies like Synopsys, Avant, and Viosoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:03">[02:52:03]</a>. After a decade, despite his contributions, he felt that the senior partners retained control over the firm's economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:03">[03:01:03]</a>. He held an "almost religious fervor" that anything other than an equal partnership was "morally wrong for a [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture capital firm]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:10">[03:14:10]</a>. This belief stemmed from a sense of fairness and proper rewards for proper work, combined with the economic reality that he was doing the work while others made the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:40">[04:02:40]</a>.

### The Dissolution of Technology Venture Investors (TVI)

TVI experienced internal discussions regarding its structure, but no resolution could be reached to address the young partners' desire for an equal partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Ultimately, the senior partners decided to "declare victory" and dissolve the firm, citing their success with the Microsoft deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. This decision was also influenced by the fact that the people they had trained no longer believed the economics were fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Bob, who preferred to convert TVI into an equal partnership, had to seek a new path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

Dave Marquardt, a partner at TVI, later went on to found August Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. His investment philosophy, even at TVI, contained the seeds of what would become the Benchmark approach:
> "The [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture business]] is an intensely personal relationship business and it's not an industry that scales well," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a> Marquardt stated. He believed companies should handle "value-added service" themselves, noting, "Bill Gates wouldn't let me bring in outside PR people and marketing Talent. That's what Founders do. My view is that the CEO ultimately is responsible and accountable for everything. They are the ones who make the decisions, the VCS are there to support and Be steady." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>

This philosophy, emphasizing founder autonomy and a supportive VC role, closely aligns with the future principles of Benchmark Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

## The Formation of Benchmark Capital

In early 1994, Bob Cagle approached his friend Bruce Dunleavy, who had interned for Bob at BCG and was then at Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Bruce, from a different background (Texas, Rice University, Goldman Sachs, and known for his Palm Pilot investment), was a rising "Young Turk" at Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

Bob proposed starting a new firm with an equal partnership model, driven by the belief in the coming internet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Bruce initially declined, lacking the financial safety net that Bob had from the Microsoft deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. However, a few months later, Merrill Pickard also began internal discussions about its next fund, where the idea of equal partnership "infected the Waters of discussion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Bruce and fellow young partner Andy Ratcliffe advocated for equal economics within Merrill Pickard, but those conversations likely yielded similar results to those at TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

Bob's decision to approach Bruce, his former subordinate, to be his equal partner was seen as an incredible act of maturity and a testament to his obsessive sense of fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. This reflected both a "religious Devotion to equality fairness" and an "absurd amount of self-confidence" from Bob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

### Challenges in Recruiting

Bob and Bruce faced significant [[challenges_and_strategy_in_venture_capital_formation | challenges]] in recruiting additional partners. When they approached other young General Partners (GPs) in Silicon Valley with their vision of an equal partnership, the prevailing reaction was disbelief and skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. Many thought they were "freaking nuts" for wanting to leave established firms and "screw up a good thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. The prevailing path for ambitious young VCs was to stay and ascend within existing structures, as exemplified by John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. Bruce admitted he even started to think they were "a little nuts too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>.

However, having "burned the boats" and left their previous firms, Bob, Bruce, and Andy Ratcliffe (who joined from Merrill Pickard) had no other option but to make their new venture work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

### The Founding Partners

Bruce suggested looking outside traditional venture capital for partners, recognizing the value of bringing "entrepreneurial DNA into the firm" to address the "problems with the way [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | traditional Venture works]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. This led to the recruitment of Kevin Harvey, a former entrepreneur who had founded two companies, one acquired by Apple and another, Approach Software, which Bruce had invested in at Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. Kevin found the prospect of joining Benchmark easier than starting another company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

While initially aiming for five partners to ensure sufficient "investment capacity" and diversification for a viable portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>, the firm sought a fifth founding member, Val Vaden, who had experience in software company buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.

By the end of 1994, the five founding partners were in place: Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, Kevin Harvey, and Val Vaden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.

## Benchmark Capital's Audacious Name and Model

The name chosen for their new firm was "Benchmark Capital," an audacious choice that signaled their intent to "set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry and how [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture capital]] is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

The firm's core principle, foundational to the [[venture_capital_firm_benchmarks_unique_partnership_model | Benchmark's unique partnership model]], is an equal partnership:
*   Each partner in a given fund receives equal carried interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   All current General Partners (GPs) own the management company, which is passed on to current equal GPs without payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This practice is not common in the industry, contrasting with how management companies like Kleiner Perkins transitioned ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

This commitment to equality, fairness, and self-confidence drove the founding partners to create a firm that sought to redefine how [[comparison_to_venture_capital_industry | venture capital]] operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

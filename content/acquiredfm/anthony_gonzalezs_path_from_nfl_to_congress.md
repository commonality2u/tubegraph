Congressman Anthony Gonzalez, serving Ohio, has had an unconventional path to public service, transitioning from a successful [[the_nfl_and_its_evolution | NFL]] career and venture-backed startup to a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. He is noted for his role on the House Financial Services Committee, particularly his deep understanding of Web3 and crypto regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Early Life and Journey to Ohio

Gonzalez's family immigrated from Cuba after the revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. His father, a steel entrepreneur in Cleveland, Ohio, settled there after his Cuban grandparents ran out of money during their honeymoon road trip from New York City to Miami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. His grandfather, a lawyer and part of a pro-democracy movement in Cuba, refused an offer from Fidel Castro's lieutenant to run a court, leading the family to flee into exile and eventually settle in Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

Gonzalez grew up in Northeast Ohio, an area he describes as "hard scrabble" but one that fosters a strong sense of pride and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. His father's steel company provided a firsthand understanding of the region's economic challenges, including the decline of manufacturing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. The closure of massive factories like LTV Steel, which once employed 20,000 people and symbolized economic health, deeply impacted the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

## Collegiate and Professional Football Career

Gonzalez played football at Ohio State, a choice influenced by a recruiting visit where Michigan's coach mistook him for a kicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. He majored in philosophy, initially planning to attend law school, influenced by his lawyer grandparents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

He was drafted in the first round of the [[the_nfl_and_its_evolution | NFL]] by the Indianapolis Colts, catching passes from Peyton Manning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. After two solid seasons, injuries derailed his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. A one-week Harvard Business School program ignited his interest in business school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. He later applied to Stanford GSB from the locker room during his final preseason game, sensing his body could no longer sustain professional football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

At Stanford, he was advised by the Investment Group of Santa Barbara (IGSB), whose model he greatly admires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>. His last professional football conversation was with Bill Belichick, who, upon releasing him from the Patriots, expressed good wishes for his business school journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Transition to Politics

Gonzalez always harbored an interest in public service, even aspiring to be mayor of Cleveland during his college years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. He initially planned to pursue politics later in life, after a long business career and raising a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. However, the 2016 election significantly altered his timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. He felt the country was on a "dangerous path politically" and felt an urgency to serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

His campaign for Congress in 2018 applied startup principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. He conducted "customer interviews" with political figures in his district to understand motivations and test his message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. His core message focused on economic issues and unity, contrasting with the national political climate of "nastiness and vitriol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. He built a strong team, including his current chief of staff, and meticulously tracked fundraising using a custom Salesforce dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

He aimed to raise $2 million for his primary campaign, achieving $600,000 in the first month to signal strength and momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. He emphasized building broad grassroots support, not just relying on high donors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Gonzalez, a "competition junkie," found the campaigning process "unbelievably rewarding" due to the direct connection with constituents and the learning experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

## Congressional Tenure and Challenges

In Congress, Gonzalez served on the House Financial Services Committee, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and the Climate Committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. He views committees as the place where "real work happens," involving hearings, dialogue, and policy debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

### January 6th and Impeachment Vote
One of the most defining moments of his term was the January 6th Capitol attack. Gonzalez had an "uneasy feeling" following the 2020 election, foreseeing potential violence due to rhetoric claiming the election was stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. On January 6th, he arrived early, witnessing buses of protestors and aggressive signs, confirming his fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. He watched from the House chamber balcony as events unfolded, feeling "disgusted" when Ted Cruz objected to certifying the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. As rioters breached the Capitol, he returned to his office, preparing to escape if necessary, and tried to contact White House officials to urge the president to call off the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

He ultimately voted to impeach President Trump after the January 6th events, one of ten House Republicans to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. He believed it was an "unforgivable assault on the country" and that the president "kind of liked it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. Despite the political risks, he felt it was necessary to send a message to "every future president forever" that such actions would lead to impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. He considers it the hardest professional decision he ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

### Decision Not to Seek Re-election
After months of reflection, Gonzalez decided not to seek re-election, primarily due to the demanding lifestyle of a congressman and its impact on his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. He noted the constant travel (150-200 days a year away from home) and the financial strain of maintaining two households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. This decision was influenced by his initial plan to enter politics later in life when his children were grown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. He will complete his term in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

## Key Policy Views and Interests

### [[congressional_focus_on_crypto | Crypto Regulation]]
Gonzalez believes that Congress is nearing legislation on [[congressional_focus_on_crypto | crypto]], particularly stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. His "aha moment" with [[congressional_focus_on_crypto | crypto]] came from listening to Kevin Rose's podcast on Flamingo DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. He then spent months researching Layer 1s, Layer 2s, tokens, and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. To better understand the space, he personally experimented with DeFi using a small amount of money, which he later donated to United Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.

He notes that about 90% of Congress members lack understanding of [[congressional_focus_on_crypto | crypto]], while 5% are getting up to speed, and another 5% (including himself) have gone deep on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. He advocates for a "do no harm" approach to regulation, similar to the Clinton administration's stance on the early internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. He argues against destroying the nascent industry due to issues like tax evasion, instead favoring targeted regulation where understanding is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. The Tara Luna crash highlighted the need to distinguish between algorithmic and fiat-backed stablecoins, with the latter being a more straightforward area for initial regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. He believes regulation should both protect consumers and provide clarity for innovators, preventing companies like FTX from building outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

### College Athletics and NIL
Gonzalez has been deeply involved in the debate surrounding Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights for college athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>. He believes it was illogical that college athletes were the only people in America unable to monetize their NIL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. He experienced this firsthand, seeing his jersey sold and autographs on eBay without receiving compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>. His wife, a swimmer at Stanford, couldn't teach swimming lessons to pay bills, despite the demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

The California bill legalizing NIL set off a "chain reaction" of differing state laws, leading to chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>. Gonzalez proposed a national standard to create an even playing field, legalizing NIL while building guardrails around inducements and recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. He warns that without congressional intervention, the current "wild west" of NIL, characterized by unregulated collectives and massive deals, could lead to college sports becoming fully professional, potentially cutting many non-revenue-generating sports and eliminating opportunities for student-athletes from diverse backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.

### American Dynamism and Competitiveness
Gonzalez sees the core political battle as a question of whether one believes in American democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>. He criticizes the tendency on both sides of the political spectrum to "destroy and tear down" institutions when things don't go their way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>. He believes this behavior emboldens adversaries like China and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. He stresses the importance of citizens participating in primaries, where most races are decided due to gerrymandering, to elect more moderate candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:38">[01:33:38]</a>.

He advocates for an American economy that is sustainable, dynamic, and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>. Dynamism, for him, means U.S. leadership in every critical technology from now until eternity, creating economic value and jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:32">[01:40:32]</a>. Resiliency, highlighted by COVID-19 supply chain disruptions, requires balancing efficiency with the ability to withstand shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:34">[01:41:34]</a>. He supports reshoring critical technologies and supply chains, especially those essential for national security like semiconductors, even if it means higher costs or environmental impacts, arguing that U.S. manufacturing generally adheres to higher standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:17">[01:42:17]</a>.

Gonzalez believes that the "prisoner's dilemma" of balancing cheap production with sustainability requires inventing new solutions through government-funded R&D, such as demonstration projects for clean steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>. He notes that private enterprise cannot underwrite 50-year R&D projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:37">[01:46:37]</a>. He is optimistic about America's ability to lead, citing the power of the free enterprise system, even amidst political dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>.

## Future Endeavors

As his term concludes, Gonzalez is focusing on finishing his legislative agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:49">[01:52:49]</a>. Looking ahead, he is considering whether to pursue a career as an investor or an operator, having enjoyed both roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:19">[01:53:19]</a>. His priority is to work with people he loves and admires, tackling exciting new challenges, and believes in the power of diverse groups coming together to build something amazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. He advises founders to focus on industries with "enormous tailwinds" where their skills can be most valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:35">[01:57:35]</a>.

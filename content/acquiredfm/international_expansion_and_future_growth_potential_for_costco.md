Costco possesses significant "running room" for future expansion, both in North America and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This potential is rooted in its consistent [[Costcos business model and growth | business model]] and its ability to attract customers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>.

## Global Footprint and Early Internationalization

Costco's journey into international markets began early, with initial expansions into Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. By the time of the Price Club merger in 1993, the combined company already boasted a large footprint of 200 stores, including locations in these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>. Throughout the 2000s, this international expansion became a major growth driver for Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.

Further international expansion included:
*   The UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>
*   Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>
*   Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>
*   Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>
*   China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>

### Penetrating Asian Markets
Entering Asian markets was not an obvious strategy for a warehouse retailer like Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:30">[01:38:30]</a>. In cultures such as Japan, where people often reside in dense urban environments with smaller homes, the concept of huge warehouses with bulk packaging seemed counterintuitive compared to the North American landscape of SUVs and suburbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:47">[01:38:47]</a>. Despite these challenges, Costco's model has proven successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. The fundamental appeal of "high quality products at a great value" resonates universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>.

## Future Growth Trajectories

Costco continues to demonstrate substantial growth potential globally, particularly in China.

### International Running Room
While debates exist about market saturation in North America, Costco is definitively not saturated in Asia, Europe, Africa, or Australia, indicating vast opportunities for global expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:53">[02:42:53]</a>.

The company has been "very deliberate" in its China strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:39">[02:43:39]</a>. Costco obtained a permit to open its first store in China 20 years before it actually did so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:41">[02:44:41]</a>. This patient, long-term approach aligns with Costco's overall strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:55">[02:44:55]</a>. The first store in China, opened in 2019, rapidly accumulated 400,000 members within two years, a significant contrast to the average U.S. store's 68,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:02">[02:44:02]</a>. All indicators suggest that Costco's model performs as well, if not better, in China than in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:30">[02:44:30]</a>. There are plans for six stores in China within the next year, pointing to considerable future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:26">[02:44:26]</a>.

### Domestic Resilience
Costco consistently performs well across all economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:39">[02:22:39]</a>. In recessionary periods, its position as the lowest-priced retailer makes it attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>. During economic booms, affluent consumers are increasingly likely to shop at Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>.

Despite concerns about market saturation in North America, Costco's management has repeatedly expressed surprise at the continued success of new stores, even in cities where they already have a presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a>. While new stores may not attract as many new members as those in entirely fresh markets, the convenience of a closer location ensures they meet profitability targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:25">[02:43:25]</a>.

## Limitations to Growth

While Costco's growth trajectory is strong, it faces inherent physical limitations. Unlike companies like Zoom or Instagram Threads, which can scale instantly with minimal bottlenecks, Costco's expansion is constrained by its physical nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:48">[02:40:48]</a>. The process requires:
*   Hiring and training the right people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:21">[02:40:21]</a>
*   Promoting internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:23">[02:40:23]</a>
*   New construction of warehouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:29">[02:40:29]</a>
*   Expanding supplier networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:29">[02:40:29]</a>
*   Establishing shipping routes for large pallets in new geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:30">[02:40:30]</a>

Cash is not a limiting factor; the physical aspects of growth impose a natural speed limit on expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:32">[02:40:32]</a>. This means Costco cannot scale as rapidly as a software company, typically maintaining an average growth rate of around 10% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:45">[02:39:45]</a>.

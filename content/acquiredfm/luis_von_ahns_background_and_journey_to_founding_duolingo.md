## Early Life and Education

Luis von Ahn hails from Guatemala, a country where learning English can significantly alter one’s economic prospects. Von Ahn had the rare opportunity to attend a private, English-speaking school, thanks to his mother’s dedication, despite their middle-class status. This educational foundation played a critical role in his life trajectory, as it exposed him to English, which he describes as transformational for individuals in non-English speaking countries. According to von Ahn, acquiring English proficiency was essential for anyone wishing to succeed globally, a belief that has influenced his mission at Duolingo [[duolingos_impact_on_language_learning_and_education_markets | Duolingo’s impact on language learning and education markets]] [00:02:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">00:02:19</a>).

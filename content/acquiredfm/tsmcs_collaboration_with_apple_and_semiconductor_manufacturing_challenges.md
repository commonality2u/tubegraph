## Introduction

[[global_semiconductor_industry_evolution_and_tsmcs_role | TSMC]], founded in 1987, has grown to become a trillion-dollar company and a critical player in the global semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:55">[02:20:55]</a>. Its unique "Pure Play Foundry" business model, focusing solely on manufacturing chips designed by others, has been a cornerstone of its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. This article explores TSMC's significant collaboration with Apple, alongside the inherent [[challenges_and_advantages_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor manufacturing challenges]] and strategic decisions that have shaped the company's trajectory.

## Overcoming Manufacturing Challenges (2009)

In 2009, Morris Chang returned as CEO of TSMC, having previously given the role to a potential successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:42">[02:12:42]</a>. His return was prompted by several pressing issues, including a significant manufacturing and quality problem with the 40 nanometer (nm) node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. This yield problem affected major customers, particularly [[tsmcs_relationship_with_nvidia | Nvidia]], which was perhaps the biggest customer for that node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>.

### Resolving the Nvidia Dispute

The 40nm node problem was a major priority for Chang upon his return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. He found that the previous CEO had insisted that TSMC was not at fault, based on the quality manager's arguments, and had offered Nvidia nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Morris Chang took a different approach. After familiarizing himself with all aspects of the problem and using market intelligence, he worked out a financial offer for Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:23">[01:31:23]</a>.

About a month after retaking the CEO position, Chang emailed Jensen Huang of Nvidia, proposing a dinner at Jensen's home followed by a business discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>. At the meeting, Chang presented an offer exceeding $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, with a 48-hour deadline for acceptance, or they would proceed to arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a>. Jensen accepted the offer within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>. This resolution highlighted the importance of strong partnerships and personal relationships in the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>.

### Strategic Investments: R&D and Capital Expenditure

Beyond the 40nm issue, Chang also faced a declining gross margin due to pricing dropping faster than costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. He also addressed mass layoffs enacted by the previous CEO, which he believed were a "knee-jerk reaction" to the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

A key strategic move was to fix the R&D budget at 8% of revenue, regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:21">[01:40:21]</a>. This decision, described as the "best news" for R&D, propelled TSMC's development efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. Additionally, Chang significantly increased capital expenditures, tripling annual capex to nearly $6 billion in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:01">[01:43:01]</a>. This bold move, which faced questions from the board, was driven by the R&D team's conviction that the 28nm node would be a "sweet spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:05">[01:44:05]</a>. Chang, referencing Shakespeare, believed it was their "tide in the affairs of man" to take on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:28">[01:46:28]</a>. This commitment positioned TSMC for leadership at the leading edge of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

## Collaboration with Apple

TSMC's relationship with Apple began in a serendipitous manner. Around late 2010, after a board meeting, Morris Chang's wife informed him that Terry Gou (founder and CEO of Foxconn, and a distant relative of his wife) was coming to dinner, bringing an Apple Vice President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This was significant as Chang had been "thinking" about winning Apple's business, but knew Apple was a "close mouth company" that would only approach suppliers when ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.

The Apple Vice President turned out to be Jeff Williams, Apple's Chief Operating Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>. Williams was straightforward, immediately pitching Apple's need for chip manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. He initially mentioned a 40% gross margin offer for TSMC, but Chang noted TSMC's margin was already 45% and aimed for 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

A key surprise was Apple's request for TSMC to develop and produce chips on the 20nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. This was a "half step" and a "detour" from TSMC's planned progression from 28nm directly to 16nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. At the time, TSMC's R&D resources were not sufficient to work on two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>.

Despite the vast capital expenditure already committed to 28nm (without Apple in mind), the Apple request for 20nm would require even more capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>. After financial planning and consultation with Goldman Sachs, TSMC decided not to cut dividends or sell new stock but to borrow money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. Chang decided to take only half of Apple's requested demand for the 20nm chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>. When TSMC's business development director, C.C. Wei (the current CEO), informed Apple's purchasing people of this, the response was "you must be crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>. However, when Chang himself spoke to Jeff Williams, Williams accepted the decision, only suggesting that TSMC eliminate its dividend to fund the investment, which Chang refused due to shareholder impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>.

### Competing with Intel for Apple's Business

In February 2011, Jeff Williams informed Chang that Intel's "highest level" had approached Tim Cook to consider Intel for iPhone chips, pausing discussions with TSMC for two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:03">[01:37:03]</a>. Chang was not overly worried, despite Intel's historical dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:14">[01:38:14]</a>. He reviewed Apple's supplier criteria: technology (TSMC felt at par with Intel), manufacturing (TSMC felt better), and customer trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:10">[01:40:10]</a>.

A month later, Chang visited Apple. Tim Cook met him and explained that "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. Chang interpreted this as Intel's lack of customer focus and inability to respond courteously to every request, unlike TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a>. Intel's existing PC customers, like those in Taiwan, "none of them liked Intel" and wished for another supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>. Today, TSMC manufactures all of Apple's chips, while Intel does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>.

### Trade-offs and the Samsung Challenge

The decision to pursue the 20nm node for Apple had a significant [[tsmcs_geopolitical_and_technological_risks | technological risk]] and trade-off: it delayed TSMC's 16nm node development, as their R&D was not strong enough to work on two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. This allowed Samsung to get ahead in 16nm development because they "got to skip 20" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>.

Morris Chang was "shocked" when Apple placed initial 16nm orders with Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>. He emailed Jeff Williams, expressing concern given the tens of billions of dollars TSMC had invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:06">[01:53:06]</a>. Williams reassured him, stating that once TSMC was ready with their 16nm process, Apple would buy all their needs from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>. Indeed, about half a year later, when TSMC's 16nm was ready, "most of Apple's 16 nanometer requirements still belonged to us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>. This situation underscored the advantage of the Pure Play Foundry model; Samsung was Apple's "chief competitor" in end products, creating inherent conflicts of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:13">[01:55:13]</a>.

## Strategic Advantages in Semiconductor Manufacturing

### The Pure Play Foundry Model

Morris Chang's vision for TSMC from its inception was a "Pure Play Foundry," meaning it would only manufacture chips for others, never design its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. This was initially a pragmatic choice, as Taiwan lacked the capability to design chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>. However, Chang "saw it coming" that a "fabless" business model would emerge, where companies focused solely on chip design without owning manufacturing facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>. This foresight, combined with a willingness to serve even initial "crappy business" (excess capacity from IDMs) to build capability and volume, allowed TSMC to be ready when the fabless revolution occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:59">[02:36:59]</a>.

This model fundamentally differentiates TSMC from Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel or IBM, who design and manufacture their own chips. Morris Chang cited an example with Qualcomm, an early fabless company that was a customer of IBM's semiconductor division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>. When IBM began losing Qualcomm's business to TSMC in the late 1990s, IBM later proposed a co-development of the 0.13 micron (130nm) technology with TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:31">[01:59:31]</a>. TSMC declined, knowing that co-development with a company that saw itself as the "senior partner" would cause them to "lose our ability to develop our own process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:41">[02:00:41]</a>. UMC, TSMC's Taiwanese peer, accepted the offer "only to regret seriously their acceptance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>.

### The Learning Curve Theory

A critical underpinning of TSMC's strategy is the application of the "learning curve theory," which Morris Chang refined for the semiconductor industry during his time at Texas Instruments in the early 1970s, working with Bruce Henderson and Bill Bain of Boston Consulting Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>. The theory posits that as a company produces more of a product, its unit cost goes down due to gained experience and increased efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>.

For TSMC, this means aiming to be the largest volume player to achieve the lowest costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. They strategically accelerate price reductions in early stages of a new node to outcompete others, attract all customers, and aggregate demand. This leads to economies of scale and reinforces their dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:50">[02:38:50]</a>. This strategy requires precise forecasting of future market demand for chip products, as being off by even 5-10% can tank profitability for a node generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:51">[02:40:51]</a>.

### The Hsinchu Science Park Ecosystem

The success of TSMC is deeply intertwined with the unique ecosystem of the Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:42">[02:27:42]</a>. This government-sponsored industrial park hosts TSMC, its partners (like ASML for equipment), and its customers (like Cadence, Synopsis, Arm, Qualcomm, MediaTek) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:26">[02:28:26]</a>. The close physical proximity facilitates "extremely close communication" necessary for the complex interdependencies of semiconductor manufacturing, such as tool design for new nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:31">[02:29:31]</a>. Furthermore, two universities within the park "crank out PhDs every year" who are absorbed directly into the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>. This integrated environment makes it incredibly difficult to replicate TSMC's capabilities elsewhere, requiring "decades to recreate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53">[02:30:53]</a>. The park stands as a testament to one of the "most successful government funded industry initiative[s] of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:06">[02:31:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

TSMC's journey, marked by Morris Chang's strategic leadership and a relentless focus on its Pure Play Foundry model, allowed it to navigate significant manufacturing challenges and forge critical collaborations with companies like Apple. By embracing the learning curve theory and leveraging the unique Hsinchu Science Park ecosystem, [[role_of_tsmc_in_the_semiconductor_ecosystem | TSMC]] not only overcame the complexities of semiconductor manufacturing but also achieved an unparalleled leadership position in the global industry. The company's massive investments in R&D and capital expenditure, often betting billions on future nodes, demonstrate a deep understanding of the industry's natural monopoly characteristics, where early and decisive volume leads to enduring success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>.

From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The podcast *Acquired* hosts Mitch Lasky and Blake Robbins, creators of the podcast *Gamecraft*, to discuss the history of the gaming industry from a business perspective. Their work emphasizes how business models have shaped the creative output of video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Business Models and Creativity

A common narrative suggests that video games are primarily created by "creative geniuses" like Shigeru Miyamoto, with business models then adapting around their visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. However, the discussion highlights that clear [[platform_business_models | business models]] often guide the direction of creativity in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Game designers, despite their brilliance, are significantly constrained by the [[platform_business_models | business models]] in which they operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

For instance, in the "package goods era," the goal was to sell a physical disc and encourage consumers to buy another a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This [[platform_business_models | business model]] necessitated a degree of "planned obsolescence" in game design, ensuring players would need new titles (e.g., numerous *FIFA* or *Call of Duty* iterations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This dynamic, where creative industries are shaped by their underlying [[platform_business_models | business models]], applies broadly beyond gaming, akin to the luxury goods industry discussed in an LVMH episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Key Shifts in Gaming Business Models

### Free-to-Play

The introduction of the free-to-play [[platform_business_models | business model]] is described as a "revolutionary" change, comparable to television's impact on the film business or the NFL's embrace of television over fighting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This model has profoundly changed how games are consumed, played, and made, requiring a different kind of game design compared to the old "everything onto a disc" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

### Online Distribution and Platform-Based Publishers

The shift from package goods sold at retail to online distribution, exemplified by the rise of Steam, represents another significant transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. This led to the emergence of "platform-based publishers" who leverage online platforms to aggregate demand and influence the supply side of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

Steam, initially conceived by Valve founders Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington as a software updater for their games (like *Half-Life 2* and *CS:GO*) to fix bugs and validate licenses, incrementally added features such as a community, an app store, and mods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. This evolution turned Steam into an $8 billion-a-year business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, so dominant that even Microsoft puts its games on Steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.

Tencent's success with QQ, leveraging its messaging platform for games, is cited as a "kill shot" for platform-based publishing, demonstrating how to use the internet to disrupt the traditional package goods industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Unlike Facebook, which has made multiple attempts at gaming but treated it as a "bad smell," Tencent embraced and invested deeply in gaming, becoming a credible platform-based publisher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

### Forever Games

The concept of "forever games" emerged with the shift to free-to-play, focusing on long-duration play patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. These games endure, like *Grand Theft Auto V*, through continuous updates for new generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Even older franchises like *FIFA* and Nintendo's *Mario* and *Zelda* have demonstrated durability by offering similar play patterns and characters across new iterations, essentially repackaging the same experience repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## Console Business Models

The console business model, selling a box and physical hardware, has remained largely consistent since 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. This model relies on charging for the "right to get online" (e.g., Xbox Live's $5/month subscription) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>. This creates a highly committed user base with stored credit card information and easy payment rails, leading to significant monetization potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>.

[[sonys_role_in_the_gaming_industry | Sony's role in the gaming industry]] has historically focused on getting users to buy their console and then their games, using the desire to play with friends as a "carrot stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. In contrast, Nintendo and Microsoft have embraced cross-platform play, notably with *Fortnite*, allowing players on different consoles to interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>. This openness from Microsoft and Nintendo is seen as a strategic move against [[sonys_role_in_the_gaming_industry | Sony's]] dominant market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

Microsoft's Game Pass is highlighted as a potential "harbinger" of the end of the platform-based publisher as we know it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. Historically, publishers aggregated users to collapse supply, but Game Pass is now aggregating supply (e.g., with the Activision acquisition) to offer compelling content for subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. This subscription model, combined with cloud streaming platforms like xCloud, offers a convenient "all you can eat" option for gamers who don't want to invest in high-end gaming PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

## Evolution of the Gaming Audience

In the early 1990s, the video game business was still in a "geeky era," primarily for "nerds" like Mitch Lasky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The notion of casual gaming only began around 1996 with titles like *Barbie's Fashion Designer* and digital versions of board games like *Yahtzee* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. While the mainstream industry often viewed these as "not the real games business," casual gaming now constitutes more than 50% of the video game business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Many casual gamers, like those playing *Candy Crush*, might not even identify as "gamers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

## Investment in Gaming

Mitch Lasky's investment philosophy focuses on investing in "businesses, not in studios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>. He seeks companies with strategies that "transcend" simply making a game and putting it on a store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. The content is a means to an end, but the end must be "something more durable, something more value aggregating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.

An example is his investment in That Game Company, led by Jenova Chen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. Chen's pitch focused not on a specific game, but on exploring a wider spectrum of human emotions in games beyond anger and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>. This vision for a "digital theme park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>, and Chen's willingness to build a "forever game" (Sky) rather than just another console indie title, aligned with Lasky's investment criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. *Sky* became a massive success, grossing hundreds of millions in revenue, with over 30% net income margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>.

Lasky prioritizes "distribution is King" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>, seeking companies with "distribution leverage" that can provide a "customer acquisition advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. Riot Games, for example, gained an advantage by understanding the existing audience for *Defense of the Ancients* (a *Warcraft III* mod) and then acquiring its fan websites to redirect users to *League of Legends* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>. This "growth hack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a> bypassed reliance on paid customer acquisition, which is seen as a "slippery slope" that can lead to unhealthy dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>.

## New Frontiers in Business Models

### Web3 and Crypto Gaming

Initially skeptical, Mitch Lasky now sees "a bit of hope" for Web3 gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:21">[01:24:21]</a>. Early Web3 games were often "crappy games" made by "crypto people slumming in games" who were more interested in NFTs and marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:59">[01:24:59]</a>. However, a new generation of game developers are now applying Web3 technologies to genuinely enhance gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.

A good Web3 game should "adhere very closely to the conventional models" and use the crypto component to "improve or enhance an elder game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>. For example, a character could be minted as an NFT, providing status or opening new gameplay areas without being "pay-to-win," which is considered the "death of a free-to-play game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:03">[01:28:03]</a>. The 20-year-old economic simulation game *Eve Online* is cited as a perfect vehicle for Web3 integration due to its fundamental economic gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>.

A major challenge for Web3 games is the "speculator problem," where the value of in-game assets (like NFTs or tokens) increases so much that players don't want to spend them, hindering the dynamism of the in-game economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:34">[01:35:34]</a>. This also attracts speculators who don't play the game, pricing out average users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>.

Roblox, though not Web3, demonstrates a viable peer-to-peer economy within a highly taxed App Store, where developers are paid in Robux, leading to a 55-60% gross tax when converted to real currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:54">[01:32:54]</a>. Similarly, *Counter-Strike* allows virtual cosmetic goods (skins) obtained from loot boxes to be traded on Steam's marketplace, generating real value and secondary sales for Valve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a>.

### Esports

Esports is primarily viewed as a "marketing engine" for games, driving engagement and continued sales of in-game items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>. While some Esports organizations have become brands, they often struggle financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>. The value accrues mostly to the game publishers (e.g., *League of Legends*, *Overwatch*, *CS:GO*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. For example, a Chinese team winning *League of Legends* Worlds can lead to a $150 million revenue opportunity from increased skin sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.

The appeal of Esports is the perception that "the dream is obtainable," unlike traditional sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. Players can directly queue up against top players, and if they perform well, they can gain fame, similar to the poker boom where online players could progress to the World Series of Poker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.

### AI in Gaming

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to revolutionize game development and operations, particularly in four areas:

1.  **Art Pipeline**: Automating the creation of various art assets (e.g., 30 variations of a chair) to reduce staggering costs and accelerate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:40">[02:01:40]</a>.
2.  **Quality Assurance (QA) and Balancing**: AI can play games, identify bugs, and even report if an activity is "fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:54">[02:02:54]</a>. It can also find "arbitrage" advantages in game mechanics and suggest counters to maintain competitive balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:02">[02:04:02]</a>.
3.  **Live Operations (LiveOps)**: Automating the delicate process of introducing new content, balancing (buffs and nerfs), and maintaining dynamism in existing games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:22">[02:05:22]</a>. AI could design real-time quests tailored to players' capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:55">[02:05:55]</a>.
4.  **Live DMing**: Providing AI assistance for roles like Dungeon Masters in games like *Dungeons & Dragons*, helping to supply narrative and interactive non-player characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:17">[02:06:17]</a>.

While AI may not immediately enable anyone to "describe a game and it'll magically appear," it will significantly democratize game development by providing tools and engines that accelerate the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:58">[02:00:58]</a>. User-generated content (UGC) platforms like *Fortnite Creative*, Core, and Roblox are likely to accrue significant value during this "AI asset generation time," as users can rapidly spin up 3D assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:40">[02:07:40]</a>. This could lead to new genres and game experiences emerging from the community itself, much like mods did in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:44">[02:10:44]</a>.

## Historical Stigma of Gaming

The gaming industry has historically faced a stigma, rooted in its origins in the "toy business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>. Companies like Hasbro even attempted to acquire Activision in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>. Early games' focus on "violent stuff" and a narrow emotional spectrum contributed to this perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:39">[01:54:39]</a>. However, the industry has shifted, now supplying IP to "serious drama" like *The Last of Us* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:48">[01:54:48]</a>, and games have become increasingly social, serving as a primary way for friends to connect online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:01">[01:54:01]</a>.

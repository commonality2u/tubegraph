These companies exemplify [[capitalefficient_growth_strategies | capital-efficient growth]], having both achieved substantial market presence with judicious use of capital.

## Veeva Systems: Minimal Capital, Maximum Impact

Veeva Systems, co-founded by Peter Gassner, provides cloud-based software solutions for the global life sciences industry. What makes Veeva's journey exceptional is its capital efficiency. Peter discussed their fundraising journey by highlighting some key points:

1. **Initial Fundraising**: Veeva raised only $4 million in venture capital from Emergence Capital early in its lifecycle. Remarkably, they did not even consume all these funds before going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The company started in 2007 and raised the venture round about a year after inception in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

2. **Efficient Use of Capital**: Veeva's focus was on maintaining a profitable business model from the start. Instead of spending excessively on marketing or unnecessary expansions, they invested heavily in product development and customer relationships [[the_role_of_marketing_and_customer_engagement_in_startups | customer relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

3. **Revenue Model**: By emphasizing high-dollar contracts with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Veeva ensured strong cash flow, thus reducing dependency on external capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Zoom: The Journey from Rejection to Embracing Efficiency

Eric Yuan, the founder and CEO of Zoom, shared the challenges and strategies involved in the company's capital journey:

1. **Early Struggles**: Initially, Eric found it difficult to convince venture capitalists of Zoom's potential, facing several rejections when trying to raise capital. It wasn't until he reached out to friends and angel investors that he raised $3 million in seed funding [[challenges_and_advice_for_company_founders | facing several rejections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

2. **Venture Capital Success**: Eventually, Zoom raised $30 million from Emergence Capital and an additional $100 million from Sequoia [[venture_capital_models_and_strategies | raised $30 million from Emergence Capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Notably, Zoom did not need to use the vast majority of these funds, highlighting their disciplined financial management practices.

3. **Scaling with Discipline**: Despite having venture capital available, Zoom prioritized building a strong engineering team over marketing and sales, relegating these aspects until product-market fit was evidently achieved [[product_excellence_and_market_fit | product-market fit was evidently achieved]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

- **Product Excellence**: Both companies focused on developing high-quality products that naturally attracted customer interest without heavy spending on marketing.
- **Precise Customer Engagement**: Understanding customer needs was emphasized over pursuing broad marketing pushes, allowing for organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

Nvidia's financial journey has been marked by periods of immense growth, significant downturns, and strategic pivots that ultimately led to its current market dominance and high valuation.

## Early Growth and Market Volatility

After surviving intense competition in the graphics card market and fending off commoditization attempts by Intel, Nvidia emerged as a public company around 2004-2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. Following the tech bubble crash, its stock performed well, and its market capitalization grew from sub-billion dollars to between $5 billion and $6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. By mid-2007, operating primarily as a gaming company, Nvidia's market cap reached just under $20 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:52">[09:51:52]</a>.

However, the company's focus on long-term initiatives like CUDA, while still heavily invested in gaming, led to financial instability. In mid-2008, Nvidia "whiffed on earnings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>, and its stock plummeted by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This severe drop was attributed not only to the financial crisis but also to the perception that Nvidia had taken its "eye off the ball of course" in the gaming market, with CUDA not yet generating significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:51">[02:50:51]</a>.

The early 2010s saw Nvidia's growth stagnate, with some years showing only 10% growth or remaining flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. In 2011, the company again "whiffed on earnings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, resulting in another 50% stock drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. During this period, the company's ventures into mobile technology, such as the Tegra chip launched in 2008, did not significantly alter its financial trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## The AI Revolution and Unfathomable Scale

The turning point came with the 2012 ImageNet competition and the AlexNet algorithm, which demonstrated the groundbreaking potential of deep learning using [[The development and impact of Nvidias CUDA architecture | NVIDIA GPUs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This moment is described as the "big bang moment for [[Nvidias role in the growth of artificial intelligence and deep learning | artificial intelligence]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, with CUDA and Nvidia's hardware at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

Despite this breakthrough, the market was slow to recognize its significance. Nvidia's stock traded below $5 a share between 2012 and 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. It wasn't until 2016 that Nvidia's market cap returned to its 2007 peak of $20 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, nearly a decade later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Even as late as early 2019, the stock could be bought for $34 a share, which now appears as a minor dip on its long-term growth chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

The scale of computing required for modern AI and deep learning is "literally unfathomable to the human mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Training a single speech recognition machine learning model requires more math operations than there are grains of sand on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. [[NVIDIAs strategic positioning and dominance in AI | Nvidia's GPUs]], particularly with their parallel processing capabilities, proved uniquely suited for this demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## Data Center Dominance and Financial Performance

The growth of deep learning created a massive demand for Nvidia's GPUs in data centers. Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple became dependent on Nvidia's hardware and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. In 2018, Nvidia even began restricting the use of its consumer graphics cards in data centers, directing enterprises to its higher-priced, specialized data center cards, which lack video outputs and are purely for compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

The prices for these data center components are substantially higher; an A100 card can cost $20,000-$30,000, compared to consumer cards like the RTX 3090 at $2,000-$3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. This shift fueled an incredible surge in Nvidia's data center revenue. Two years ago, data center revenue was about $3 billion, roughly half of gaming revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>. Over the last two years, it 3xed to over $10.5 billion annually, becoming comparable in size to the gaming segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

In 2020, Nvidia acquired Mellanox, an Israeli data center networking company, for approximately $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This acquisition integrated high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity into Nvidia's data center offerings, creating a "third leg of the stool" of computing called the Data Processing Unit (DPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.

Financially, Nvidia is a "very cash generative business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:53">[01:24:53]</a>. They generate $8 billion of free cash flow annually and sit on $21 billion in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>. In the last fiscal year, Nvidia reported $27 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>. Their gross margin is an impressive 66% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>, up from 30% in 1999 and surpassing 50% by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Operating margins are also high at 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

Despite its current market cap of around half a trillion dollars, Nvidia's revenue is still significantly lower than other tech giants like Google, which had $43 billion in ad revenue in Q4 2021 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. This suggests a very rich valuation, with Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio being three times that of Apple and nearly double Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>.

## Future Ambitions and Challenges

Nvidia continues to grow at an astonishing rate for a 30-year-old company, accelerating at 60% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:28">[01:29:28]</a>. At its GTC developer conference, Nvidia announced a "trillion-dollar market" opportunity, stating they aim to serve customers representing a "hundred trillion dollar opportunity" and capture 1% of that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>. This ambitious target encompasses segments like automotive, the Omniverse, and robotics.

In 2022, Nvidia announced they would start licensing much of their software, including CUDA, separately from their hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. This move is seen as an opportunity to generate incremental revenue from enterprises that require commercial-grade solutions rather than open-source alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

Despite the high valuation, Nvidia's business model is remarkably capital-efficient. They spend only about $1 billion in capex per year, a fraction compared to Apple ($10 billion), Microsoft and Google ($25 billion each), or chip manufacturer TSMC ($30 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:50">[01:59:50]</a>. This is due to their "fabulous" business model, where they design software and IP while TSMC handles the manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:14">[02:00:14]</a>.

The company faces potential [[potential_future_challenges_and_opportunities_for_nvidia | future challenges]] from competitors like AMD in gaming and startups like Cerebras or Graphcore in specialized AI hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. Additionally, major customers like Google and Apple are developing their own in-house silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. However, the immense investment in 15 years of CUDA and its ecosystem creates a significant barrier to entry for competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

[[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] has adopted a business strategy that involves giving up current profits for anticipated future gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Objectives of the Strategy
The primary aim of this approach is to secure future revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This can be achieved through:
*   **Customer loyalty**: Retaining existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **New customer acquisition**: Attracting new clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

The expectation is that more customers and increased revenue in the future will lead to greater differential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Scale Economies
This strategy relies on the presence of scale economies within the [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] is argued to possess an "unusual type of scale economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Unusual Industry Characteristics
The [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] exhibits several unique characteristics that influence [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC's]] strategic choices:

### Large, Lumpy Capital Investments
The construction of a new fabrication plant (fab) requires substantial capital investment, estimated at $10 billion or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Predictable Performance Advances (Moore's Law)
The industry benefits from predictable material performance advances, often associated with Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This allows for a high assurance that making the correct technology choices will lead to significant improvements, such as a "10x improvement in 18 months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This level of predictability is considered "very unusual" in most industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and is contingent on making the right technological decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Reliance on Upstream Suppliers
Technological advantages within the [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] are significantly driven by upstream suppliers, such as [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This reliance necessitates making difficult choices regarding technological pathways, as seen in historical debates within semiconductor companies about adopting technologies like X-ray lithography, which involved considerable investment in research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

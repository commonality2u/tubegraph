## The Accidental Google Investment

The story of [[Jeff Bezos investment in Google | Jeff Bezos]] and McKenzie Bezos's significant financial growth is intricately linked to an ill-conceived acquisition by Amazon and the subsequent relationships maintained by [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff Bezos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Junglee Acquisition and Ram Shriram's Connection

Amazon acquired a company called Junglee, a comparison shopping site founded by three Stanford computer science PhDs and a business person from Netscape named Ram Shriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Amazon purchased Junglee for an estimated $150-175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. However, the acquisition failed as the Junglee team, forced to move from Palo Alto to Seattle to avoid a California tax nexus for Amazon, quit within a few months and returned to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

Despite the failed acquisition, [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff Bezos]] and Ram Shriram remained friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Ram Shriram, through his co-founders from Junglee, connected with two other Stanford computer science PhDs: Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Shriram made the first investment of $250,000 in Google and joined its board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

### Jeff and McKenzie Bezos's Google Investment

About six months after Ram Shriram's initial investment, [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff Bezos]] heard about Google. He reached out to Shriram, who arranged a meeting in Silicon Valley at his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff]] and McKenzie Bezos flew down for the breakfast meeting with Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

After the meeting, [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff Bezos]] expressed a desire to invest in Google on the same terms as Ram Shriram, even though the seed round had closed and larger venture capital firms were circling for a Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Ram Shriram successfully convinced Larry and Sergey to accept an additional $250,000 from [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff]] and McKenzie Bezos's personal money at the original seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

The subsequent Series A for Google was famously split between John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and Mike Moritz of Sequoia, valuing Google at a $100 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Mike Moritz, despite the valuation, reportedly commented, "We've never paid so much for so little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Ram Shriram's initial investment was estimated at a $10 million or even lower post-money valuation, suggesting a significant return for him before the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

It is considered safe to say that [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff]] and McKenzie Bezos personally owned at least one percent of Google, even after dilution from the Series A, as Google went public without raising another venture round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

### Impact on Bezos's Wealth

In 2004, Google had its Initial Public Offering (IPO) with a market capitalization of $23 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. At the IPO, [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff]] and McKenzie Bezos's shares, representing one percent, would have been worth approximately $230 million, or a quarter-billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

[[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff Bezos]] has never publicly commented on whether he and McKenzie sold their Google shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. However, they would not have had the opportunity to sell before the IPO, meaning they held at least one percent of Google until its public offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

Since its IPO 18 years ago (as of the transcript's context), Google's value has increased by 65x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. This means even if [[Jeff Bezos Background and DecisionMaking Framework | Jeff Bezos]] was not selling Amazon shares, he had ample capital for other ventures like investing in Blue Origin rocket companies, cool clocks, and venture funds like Benchmark and PSL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. The long-term relationship with Ram Shriram, maintained after the Junglee acquisition, proved to be an amazing and financially transformative connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

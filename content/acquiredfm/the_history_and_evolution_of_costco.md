Costco is a company deeply admired for its business model, with observers often finding more positive aspects the deeper they investigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Warren Buffett's partner, Charlie Munger, is a well-known fan of Costco, even serving on its board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:29">[02:28:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

At its core, Costco appears simple: selling in bulk allows for great deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. However, its success is attributed to "50 clever innovations" refined over many years, working together like an orchestra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Every aspect, from extra-wide parking spaces to rotisserie chickens, is intentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Core Tenets and Success Metrics
Costco aims to offer "extremely Great Value" on high-quality products at the "lowest possible prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This approach has led to impressive results:
*   **Revenue Growth:** Around 10% for over 30 consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Revenue per Square Foot:** Comparable to luxury brands like Tiffany, significantly higher than [[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Global Expansion:** Significant room for [[costcos_global_expansion | international expansion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Kirkland Signature:** Costco's store brand, [[the_impact_of_kirkland_signature | Kirkland Signature]], alone generates more revenue ($52 billion/year, not including gas) than all of Nike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. It might be the largest consumer package brand globally by revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Founding and Early Influences
Costco was formally founded in Seattle in 1983 by retail veterans Jim Sinegal and Jeffrey Brotman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Jeff Brotman came from a family of Seattle retailers and was an early investor and board member of [[howard_schultz_and_the_evolution_of_starbucks | Starbucks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

However, the true [[the_history_and_evolution_of_costco | history of Costco]] dates back much further to Saul Price and his companies, FedMart and Price Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Saul Price's innovations and stacked learnings heavily influenced Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Saul Price: A Retail Revolutionary
Solomon "Saul" Price was born in 1916 in the Bronx, New York, to Jewish immigrants from Belarus who worked in garment factories with harsh conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This environment, including events like the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire which spurred the American labor movement, shaped his political ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

Saul Price is considered one of the most influential American retail capitalists, alongside Sam Walton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Sam Walton himself admitted in "Made in America" that he "stole more ideas from Saul than anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Jim Sinegal, Costco's co-founder and CEO, famously stated he "learned everything" from Saul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### The Birth of FedMart
After moving to San Diego and becoming a lawyer, Saul Price advised new retail startups in the booming post-WWII city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. He observed FedCo, a non-profit membership club in Los Angeles that allowed federal employees to pool buying power for better prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. FedCo charged a one-time $5 lifetime membership fee and became very popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

After FedCo declined partnerships, Saul Price and his partners opened FedMart in November 1954 in San Diego, cloning the FedCo model as a *for-profit* company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. The name "Mart" was influential, inspiring names like [[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Walmart]] and Kmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

FedMart was the first scaled "discounter" in America, selling goods below manufacturer-set minimum prices by operating as a membership club not open to the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This innovation predated and influenced future discount retailers like Walmart and Kmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

FedMart was an immediate success, generating $3 million in sales in its first year (1954) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. It quickly expanded to Arizona and Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

In 1959, Jim Sinegal was hired as a part-time bagger at FedMart in San Diego and worked for Saul for 22 years, eventually running FedMart's distribution and centralized warehousing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

FedMart expanded its offerings to include gasoline (priced slightly lower to drive traffic) and pharmacies (facing industry death threats for undercutting prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. They also developed their own "FM" house brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.

Saul Price codified "FedMart's Four Priority Order Principles":
1.  Provide the best possible value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
2.  Pay good wages and provide good benefits to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.
3.  Maintain honest business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.
4.  Make money for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
These principles, particularly avoiding "loss leaders" (selling below cost to attract customers) and prioritizing employee wages, laid the foundation for [[costcos_competitive_strategies | Costco's unique strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Costco's average hourly wage today is $26, compared to Walmart's $19.50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This leads to extremely low employee turnover (7% attrition rate for hourly workers at Costco vs. 20% typical retail) and low "shrinkage" (unaccounted for merchandise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

### The Price Club Era
In the late 1960s/early 1970s, Saul Price sold FedMart to a German hypermarket operator, Hugo Mann. The deal was misaligned, as Mann was interested in FedMart's real estate, while Price wanted capital for expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. Saul Price was fired from his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. This event, at age 60, motivated him to start anew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

In 1976, Saul and his son Robert founded Price Club, focusing on a wholesale warehouse model for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. The idea was to take advantage of FedMart's successful centralized warehousing operations run by Jim Sinegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Key to this model was the manufacturer's direct delivery of products to the warehouse, eliminating Price Club's need for extensive logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. They also decided to stock only about 3,000 high-volume items, a non-consensus move compared to discounters with 50,000+ SKUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

Initially, Price Club struggled to attract businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. A stroke of luck came when the San Diego City Credit Union inquired about getting their members access to wholesale prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. Price Club created a "group membership" plan for credit union members, allowing consumers to shop there at slightly higher prices than business members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. This unlocked a "gusher of consumers" and initiated the viral word-of-mouth growth that defines Costco today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.

A famous innovation, the $1.50 hot dog and soda deal, originated during this period when hot dog vendors wanted to set up carts at Price Club exits. Saul Price decided to offer it themselves, securing a supplier for hot dogs and carts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. This remains one of Costco's iconic offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

Price Club's model led to a "negative cash conversion cycle," where goods are sold before the company has to pay suppliers, effectively financing inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. Costco today turns its inventory 12.4 times per year, selling it in about 26-27 days, well within the typical 30-day payment terms to suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.

## The Costco Merger and Modern Business Model
Price Club went "public" in 1979 by crossing the 500-shareholder threshold that mandated SEC filings, without needing to raise capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.

In 1982, Sam Walton visited Saul Price to learn about Price Club, leading to the creation of [[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Sam's Club]] within 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. Similarly, Bernie Marcus visited Saul and was inspired to start [[history_and_evolution_of_ikea | Home Depot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.

Also in 1982, Seattle retailers Bernie Brotman and his son Jeff, after being denied a Price Club franchise, decided to clone the model themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. They recruited Jim Sinegal, who had recently left FedMart, as a co-founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. Jim Sinegal, Saul Price's protégé and a "generational talent," was perfectly suited to lead Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.

Costco and Price Club merged in June 1993, forming the United Price Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. This was largely a "reuniting" due to the shared history and Jim Sinegal's strong relationship with Saul Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>. The merger was a near "merger of equals" (52% to Costco, 48% to Price Club shareholders), driven partly by the need to compete with [[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Sam's Club's aggressive expansion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

## Key Elements of [[costcos_business_model_and_success | Costco's Business Model]]
### Membership
The membership model is critical to [[costcos_business_model_and_success | Costco's profitability]] and psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.
*   **Customer Selection:** The upfront fee and bulk buying select for wealthier customers (typical household income $125,000/year, compared to US median of $71,000) who are less sensitive to cash flow and have storage space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>.
*   **Encourages Usage:** Paying the fee encourages members to shop more to maximize value, an "endowment effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>.
*   **Reduced Shrinkage:** Members are less likely to steal, wanting to retain their membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.
*   **Profit Driver:** Membership fees represent about 70% of Costco's operating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:16">[01:51:16]</a>. Costco generates $4.5 billion in revenue from memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>.
*   **Executive Membership:** Launched in 1998, this higher-priced membership ($120/year vs. $60) offers 2% cashback, capped at $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. The break-even point is $3,000 in annual spending, aligning with average household spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:42">[01:54:42]</a>. If a member doesn't earn enough cashback to cover the extra $60, Costco refunds the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:36">[01:55:36]</a>. Executive members (45% of paid members) represent 73% of sales and renew at a higher rate (part of the "triple play" loyalty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:23">[01:56:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:55">[01:56:55]</a>. Costco's US membership renewal rate is 93% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:18">[01:57:18]</a>.
*   **Credit Card Deal:** Costco profits from its deal with [[the_history_and_evolution_of_visa | City Visa]], where financial institutions pay Costco for the privilege of being the exclusive card issuer, rather than Costco paying processing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>.

### Pricing and Supplier Relationships
Costco enforces a strict cap on its markup: no more than 14% above supplier cost (15% for [[the_impact_of_kirkland_signature | Kirkland Signature]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. This contrasts with department stores (100% markup) or even discounters like Walmart (25% markup) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>. This strategy builds customer trust and ensures "extreme value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.

> "It's like heroin; you do it a little bit and you want a little more. Raising prices is the easy way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:47">[01:23:47]</a>
> - Jim Sinegal on raising prices

Costco maintains a "tough but fair" relationship with suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>. Buyers are deeply knowledgeable about commodity prices and work with suppliers to ensure the lowest honest price, passing most of the savings (89%) to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>.

This philosophy influenced Jeff Bezos after his 2001 meeting with Jim Sinegal, leading Amazon to shift towards working hard to charge customers less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:52">[01:28:52]</a>.

### Low SKU Count and "Intelligent Loss of Sales"
Costco's SKU (unique item) count is very low (around 3,800 today, down from 4,500 in the last decade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>, compared to Walmart's 100,000+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. This means each item turns over faster, contributing to the negative cash conversion cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

This strategy relies on customer trust that Costco has pre-selected the best one or two high-quality items in each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:54">[01:42:54]</a>.

Saul Price also developed the concept of "intelligent loss of sales," intentionally not offering all product sizes to simplify operations and reduce SKUs, even if it meant losing some potential sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:41">[01:43:41]</a>.

### Logistics and Efficiency
Costco's distribution centers primarily use a "cross-dock" system, where supplier trucks unload pallets on one side, which are then immediately loaded onto Costco trucks on the other side for delivery to warehouses, minimizing storage time and handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:23">[01:46:23]</a>. 92% of Costco's merchandise is cross-docked, compared to 10% for Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:30">[01:47:30]</a>.

This efficiency allows Costco to operate with fewer employees per dollar of revenue. They generate over $730,000 of revenue per employee, significantly higher than Walmart (doing 1/3 to 1/2 of Walmart's revenue with almost an order of magnitude fewer people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:39">[02:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:52">[02:03:52]</a>.

### Vertical Integration
Costco engages in vertical integration when it believes it can provide significant value to members by controlling the supply chain.
*   **Chickens:** Costco sells 500 million chickens a year, 130 million of which are rotisserie chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:09">[02:28:09]</a>. To counter artificial price inflation from a concentrated supplier market, Costco built its own processing facility in Nebraska and works with 150 local farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:02">[02:29:02]</a>.
*   **Eyeglasses:** Costco owns and operates three optical grinding labs to make prescription eyeglasses, addressing high prices in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:45">[02:52:45]</a>.
*   **Other Products:** They also produce their own muffins and engage in supply chain control for products like coffee and mixed nuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:40">[02:28:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:20">[02:30:20]</a>.

### "Treasure Hunt" Experience
While offering core staples, about 25% of Costco's SKUs are "treasure hunt" items – unique, one-time offerings that create novelty and drive repeat traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:26">[02:08:26]</a>. They intentionally allow these items to sell out, encouraging frequent visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:08">[02:09:08]</a>.

## Costco Today
Costco is the third-largest retailer in the US, with $230 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:10">[02:03:10]</a>. It boasts 124 million members worldwide, with one-third of US shoppers being Costco customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:26">[02:03:26]</a>.
*   **Revenue per Square Foot:** $1,800, significantly higher than Target ($450) or Walmart ($600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:03">[02:04:03]</a>.
*   **Sales per Store:** An average Costco warehouse generates over $269 million in annual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:50">[02:04:50]</a>.
*   **Same-Store Sales:** Grew by 14% last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:04">[02:06:04]</a>.

## Defensibility and Power
Costco's [[costcos_competitive_strategies | competitive advantage]] stems primarily from:
*   **Scale Economies Shared with Customers:** Costco leverages its enormous purchasing volume to get the absolute lowest prices from suppliers and then applies minimal markups (11-14%) to pass significant savings to members. This creates a powerful flywheel of attracting more members and securing better deals, forming an almost unassailable moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:09">[02:10:09]</a>.
*   **Counter-Positioning:** Costco's in-person, bulk-focused warehouse model is fundamentally counter-positioned to the convenience-driven e-commerce model of Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:06">[02:14:06]</a>. While slow to e-commerce initially, their focus on physical presence and customer value has proven highly durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:17">[02:15:17]</a>.
*   **Process Power:** Costco's consistent culture, commitment to low prices, high employee wages, and internal promotion (all three CEOs started at FedMart/Price Club) makes it difficult to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:48">[02:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:11">[02:33:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:03">[02:34:03]</a>.
*   **Latent Branding Power:** Despite minimal advertising, Costco benefits from strong word-of-mouth and customer trust in its pre-selected, high-quality inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:07">[02:18:07]</a>.

## Bear and Bull Cases
### Bear Cases
*   **Slow E-commerce Adoption:** Historically, Costco was 15 years late to e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:17">[02:38:17]</a>. While they are now approaching it in a "Costco way" (e.g., focusing on big and bulky items with [[costcos_competitive_strategies | Costco Logistics]] or offering discounts via third-party sites like CostcoNext.com to avoid complex logistics), their 11% overhead makes competing directly with Amazon's 30% overhead for home delivery unfeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:43">[02:38:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>.
*   **Growth Limits:** There is a physical limit to Costco's expansion speed due to the need for land, construction, supplier relationships, and hiring/training personnel under their specific culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:01">[02:40:01]</a>. Cash is not the constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:34">[02:40:34]</a>.

### Bull Cases
*   **Unrivaled Flywheel:** Costco's "scale economies shared with customers" flywheel continues to spin, making it nearly impossible for competitors like [[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Sam's Club]] to catch up (Sam's Club revenue is half of Costco's, and its unit base has shrunk over the last decade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:20">[02:41:20]</a>.
*   **International Expansion:** Costco has significant room for [[costcos_global_expansion | global expansion]], particularly in markets like China, where the first store in 2019 rapidly gained 400,000 members (compared to a US average of 68,000 members per store) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:45">[02:43:45]</a>.
*   **Enduring Culture:** Costco's deeply ingrained culture of long-term thinking, low margins to benefit customers, and promoting from within, ensures remarkable durability across economic cycles and leadership changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Notable Facts and Policies
*   **Fine Wine Sales:** Costco is the world's largest seller of fine wines ($20-$300 bottles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>.
*   **Refund Policy:** Costco offers an infinite, "no questions asked" refund policy on most items, inspired by Nordstrom (electronics have a 90-day limit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:11">[02:49:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:30">[02:50:30]</a>. This includes high-value items like diamond rings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:10">[02:50:10]</a>.
*   **Food Sales:** In the three days before Thanksgiving, Costco sold 2.2 million pumpkin pies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:32">[02:52:32]</a>. They also sell one-third of the world's jumbo cashews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:37">[02:52:37]</a>.
*   **Management Practices:** Market and country managers attend two-day meetings at headquarters every month to share learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:23">[02:53:23]</a>. Jim Sinegal, as CEO, famously visited every store every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:43">[02:53:43]</a>.

Overall, [[the_history_and_evolution_of_costco | Costco's story]] is one of consistent execution of a well-understood business model, built on a strong culture and intelligent trade-offs, leading to sustained success and strong customer loyalty.

Investors require two core skills: the ability to assess a company's future potential and the capacity to compare that potential value against its current selling price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) as a Fundamental Valuation Tool

A foundational principle in [[application_of_traditional_investing_principles_to_venture_capital | investing]] is that all investments and equities are ultimately valued based on the discounted value of their future cash flows, extending into perpetuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While some companies may have cash flows in the near term, others' cash flows might be very distant; regardless, they all factor into the DCF formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The nature of a DCF formula necessitates making judgments about a company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Challenges to Future Projections and Moats

Even seemingly stable companies with immense consistency can face disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The accelerating pace of technological adoption has made companies less durable today compared to previous eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Historical Perspective on Business Durability

In the past, such as the 1950s, it was far easier to identify businesses that could be predicted to remain largely unchanged over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The world was perceived as having a consistent backdrop, like a stage where actors perform but the scenery remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the present, where "everything changes every minute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Without active management to entrench [[role_of_economic_moats_in_company_valuation | moats]], fend off competition, and continuously evolve, it's very difficult for a business to stay consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Very few businesses can thrive today without competent leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Case Studies of Disruption

*   **Newspaper Industry:** Once considered to have [[role_of_economic_moats_in_company_valuation | impregnable moats]] by [[value_investing_versus_growth_investing | value investors]], newspapers benefited from local monopolies, low cost, and strong advertising demand tied to circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Their one-day shelf life also ensured repeat purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, within two decades, most newspaper companies are fighting for survival, largely due to the shift of consumer attention to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Social Media (Facebook vs. TikTok):** Rapid shifts in consumer behavior are hard to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, the emergence of a Chinese company like TikTok, with its short-form video content, unexpectedly shifted consumer attention away from established players like Facebook (Meta) and Instagram, despite Facebook's prior acquisitions and ability to maintain audience engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These [[case_studies_of_successful_and_challenging_investments | examples]] illustrate the difficulty in making [[longterm_qualitative_judgments_in_venture_capital | long-term qualitative judgments]] about future cash flows in dynamic environments.

## Implications for Valuation in a Changing World

Given increased uncertainty, greater disruption likelihood, and less permanent [[role_of_economic_moats_in_company_valuation | moats]], one might question if companies should be valued with fewer future cash flow years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

However, this is a double-edged sword:
*   While companies are more susceptible to disruption without active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, those with competitive advantages that continually leverage them to enter adjacent markets, launch new products, or expand geographically have significantly greater potential for value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   The ability for companies to build upon their advantages has never been higher, partly due to the internet enabling access to global markets, unlike the localized reach of industries such as newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Acquired Live is set to take over Radio City Music Hall in New York City on the evening of July 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This event follows the immense success of last year's [[acquired_live_event_at_chase_center | live event]] in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## A Follow-Up to an "Incredible" San Francisco Event
The previous [[acquired_live_event_at_chase_center | live show]] in San Francisco featured a conversation with [[previous_san_francisco_live_show_with_mark_zuckerberg | Mark Zuckerberg]] at the iconic [[acquired_live_event_at_chase_center | Chase Center Arena]], in partnership with JP Morgan Payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Described as "incredible" and a "life experience," the success of that event spurred the idea for a New York City follow-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. The goal was to create something that felt "uniquely New York and authentic to the Acquired cannon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

## Radio City Music Hall: An Iconic and Canonical Venue
[[design_and_collaboration_for_live_events | Acquired Live]] will be held at Radio City Music Hall, a venue chosen for its iconic status in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. The theater is known for hosting events like the Rockettes, Tony Awards, Grammys, MTV VMAs, and the NFL Draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Notably, Radio City is also a "storied part of Rockefeller Center," connecting directly to the physical legacy of Standard Oil and John D. Rockefeller, themes often explored on the [[acquired_podcast_evolution_and_audience_growth | Acquired podcast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

Radio City Music Hall is the world's largest indoor theater, with a seating capacity of 6,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## An Evening of Surprise and Delight
The details of who will join the hosts on stage are being kept "under wraps," promising an "evening of surprise and delight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The physical production for this event is described as "nuts," with the stage itself being three times the width of the one used at the [[acquired_live_event_at_chase_center | Chase Center]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

The event also marks the [[celebration_of_acquireds_10th_anniversary | Acquired podcast's 10-year anniversary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Tickets and Logistics
Attendees are encouraged to sign up for pre-sale access at acquired.fm/nyc to secure tickets when they become available in a few weeks, before the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Despite Radio City's large capacity, the hosts anticipate high demand, as over 6,000 people attended the [[chase_center_live_show_event | Chase Center show]] and the [[growth_and_success_of_the_acquired_podcast | Acquired listener base]] has grown, with New York City having a larger listener base than the Bay Area, not including the entire Northeast Corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

Tickets will be assigned seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Ticket prices will be kept in a "pretty narrow price range," around $100-$120, to ensure accessibility for as many people as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Community
The event is not intended to be profit-generating for [[acquired_podcast_and_community_engagement | Acquired]] or JP Morgan, who is co-hosting the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. All revenue from tickets will go towards production costs, such as set design and compensating the hundreds of crew members involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. The primary purpose is to celebrate [[acquired_podcast_evolution_and_audience_growth | Acquired]] and its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

The evening will provide opportunities for attendees to mingle with other [[acquired_podcast_and_community_engagement | Acquired listeners]], access special Acquired Radio City merchandise, and celebrate with fellow "business nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

The [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | story of Microsoft]] is inextricably linked to the development and impact of its Windows operating system, which transitioned from an early graphical environment into the dominant force in personal computing and the foundation for its massive enterprise business.

## Early Computing Landscape and Microsoft's Origins

In the nascent days of computing, around 1968, computers were either massive, room-sized machines with the processing power of a calculator, or humans performing calculations [11:17]. These machines primarily relied on teletypes for interaction, printing responses on paper [13:01]. The computing market was almost entirely dominated by [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]], known for its "Big Iron" mainframes and comprehensive solutions that bundled hardware, software, and services [13:51].

A significant shift occurred in 1968 when [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] proactively unbundled its hardware, software, and services due to [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | antitrust scrutiny]]. This decision, though not immediately exploited, "cracked the door" for independent software companies like [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Microsoft]] to emerge years later [15:10].

The concept of a "personal computer" was still far off [12:52]. Early "mini computers," like the DEC PDP-10, were closet-sized and more affordable (around $120,000) than [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM's]] mainframes, creating new markets in branch offices and universities [16:42]. However, their user interface was still teletype-based, with no graphical displays [19:40].

[[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Microsoft's]] co-founders, [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Bill Gates]] and [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Paul Allen]], gained early exposure to computing through a DEC PDP-10 at their high school in 1968 [10:20, 19:50]. In this era, using a computer inherently meant being a programmer, as pre-packaged software did not exist [21:06]. [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Microsoft's]] initial focus was on developing programming language interpreters, like **BASIC**, for new microprocessors [29:56]. They saw the long-term vision of exponential computing power, leading to "a computer on every desk in every home" [31:55, 32:00].

## The Rise of DOS and the IBM PC Partnership

The arrival of the Intel 8080 processor in 1974, a 16-bit microprocessor, was a turning point, making a "real computer" heart available for under $200 [35:36, 35:53]. This ignited [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Bill Gates']] commitment to computers [36:02]. While [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] was founded in 1975 to sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, the first commercially available microcomputer, the fledgling company encountered early challenges, including widespread software piracy [57:58, 58:02, 58:34]. At this time, the legal framework for software copyright was still undefined, with Congress formally recognizing computer programs as copyrightable works only in 1980 [59:06, 1:00:36].

This piracy issue highlighted a critical lesson for [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]]: the need to license software directly to hardware manufacturers (OEMs) as part of the total machine purchase, rather than relying on individual consumer sales [1:03:05, 1:03:35]. This strategy would eliminate piracy concerns and align incentives [1:04:11].

The "1977 Trinity" – the RadioShack TRS-80, Commodore PET, and [[apple_computer | Apple]] II – signaled the explosion of the mass-market personal computer industry [1:04:33]. These machines, unlike the Altair, were fully assembled and included their own proprietary operating systems [1:05:05, 1:38:01]. This period saw [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] gaining experience licensing BASIC to various OEMs, such as [[apple_computer | Apple]], often at low fixed fees to establish their BASIC as the industry standard programming environment [1:09:13, 1:10:47].

### The [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM PC]] Deal (1980)

In 1980, [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]], then the world's most valuable company with a market cap of $34 billion [1:30:24, 1:30:51], recognized the growing microcomputer market. To avoid repeating its mistake of missing the mini-computer wave to DEC, [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] initiated "Project Chess," a secret division in Boca Raton, Florida, tasked with developing an [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM PC]] within one year using off-the-shelf components [1:31:31, 1:31:50, 1:32:51].

[[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] initially approached [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] for programming languages like BASIC [1:37:05]. [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Bill Gates]] initially referred [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] to Digital Research, a company run by Gary Kildall that offered CP/M, an existing 8-bit operating system [1:38:13, 1:39:51]. However, a series of misunderstandings and disagreements over licensing terms led to Digital Research losing the deal [1:40:04, 1:42:12].

[[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] then stepped in. They licensed a 16-bit operating system called "Quick and Dirty Operating System" (QDOS) from Seattle Computer Products for $75,000 [1:43:08, 1:45:17, 1:45:50]. This OS, written by Tim Patterson, was renamed **DOS** (Disk Operating System) [1:44:50, 1:48:48].

The genius of [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Bill Gates']] strategy in the [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] deal was to sell DOS to [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] for a fixed fee (totaling $430,000 for DOS and other languages) with no ongoing royalties [1:48:50, 1:49:07]. Crucially, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] retained the rights to own and license DOS to any other manufacturer [1:50:04]. [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]], believing it would dominate the PC market, viewed this as a minor concession and even beneficial due to ongoing [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | antitrust]] scrutiny [1:51:11, 1:52:10].

> [!INFO] A Bet on the Ecosystem
> This decision by [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Microsoft]] allowed [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] to popularize the PC and legitimize the market, while [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] positioned itself as the "lynchpin" of the entire ecosystem [1:50:58, 1:54:32].

The [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM PC]] shipped in August 1981, selling 13,500 units in the first couple of months and half a million in the next two years, becoming the market leader [1:54:45, 1:55:12]. While [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] offered other OS options (CP/M and Pascal), DOS was strategically priced lowest at $60, making it the de facto choice for customers [1:56:23, 1:56:53].

> [!WARNING] The Rise of PC Clones
> [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM's]] use of off-the-shelf components and their inability to protect their BIOS from reverse engineering allowed companies like Compaq to "clone" the [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM PC]] [1:57:07, 1:58:00]. Compaq became the fastest company to hit $100 million and then $1 billion in revenue by offering cheaper [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM PC]] lookalikes [1:59:51]. This commoditized PC hardware, but it also fueled [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft's]] growth. [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] licensed DOS to all these clone manufacturers on a *per-machine sold* basis, leading to an explosion of revenue and profit with nearly 100% gross margins [2:01:12, 2:02:49].

## The Dawn of Windows: From GUI to OS Dominance

The late 1970s and early 1980s also saw the emergence of business applications like VisiCalc (the first spreadsheet) and WordStar (a word processor) on 8-bit machines like the [[apple_computer | Apple]] II, demonstrating the potential for productivity software on personal computers [2:13:50]. This prompted [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] to launch its "consumer products division" to develop application software [2:14:38].

A pivotal moment was the hiring of Charles Simonyi from [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_web_browsers | Xerox PARC]] in 1980 [2:15:09]. Simonyi brought firsthand knowledge of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the desktop metaphor, and the mouse – innovations developed at PARC [2:16:37]. While [[apple_computer | Apple]] would famously commercialize these ideas with the Macintosh, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] was equally exposed and began developing its own GUI-based applications and environments [2:16:20, 2:19:01].

### Windows 1.0 and Early Struggles

Recognizing the future of GUIs, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] announced its own graphical operating environment, **Windows**, in November 1983, even before the Mac shipped (much to [[apple_computer | Apple's]] dismay) [2:36:17, 2:36:27]. This initial version, **Windows 1.0**, released in November 1985, was conceptually a "half step" between a command-line interface and a true GUI [2:42:42, 2:57:57]. It featured a "tiled" window system, meaning applications resized and couldn't overlap, a stark contrast to the Macintosh's fluid, overlapping windows [2:57:57].

> [!INFO] [[apple_computer | Apple's]] Unwitting License
> [[apple_computer | Apple]] had licensed its GUI intellectual property (derived from Xerox PARC) to [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] for Windows 1.0 [2:39:01]. Crucially, the agreement covered "this and all future versions of Windows," a clause that would later haunt [[apple_computer | Apple]] in [[Antitrust and its Impact on Microsoft | copyright lawsuits]] [2:39:16].

For most of its early life, Windows (including versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups) was not a standalone operating system but rather a "graphical operating environment" that ran on top of **MS-DOS** [2:39:40, 2:40:07, 2:40:20].

### The OS/2 Dilemma and the Rise of Windows 3.0

During the mid-1980s, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] was deeply committed to a partnership with [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] on **OS/2**, a new modern operating system intended to replace DOS and be proprietary to [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] hardware [2:41:24, 2:42:21, 2:42:52]. This "riding the bear" strategy, as [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Steve Ballmer]] described it, was a political necessity to remain aligned with the dominant [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] [2:43:40]. However, [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM's]] strategic decision to use the less powerful Intel 286 chip (which [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Bill Gates]] called "brain dead") for its PC/AT, instead of the more capable 386 chip, hindered the development of a truly powerful GUI [2:45:17, 2:45:26].

This opened the door for PC clone makers like Compaq to release 386-based machines, which were powerful enough to run Windows effectively [2:46:03]. Internally, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] (especially the Windows team, which was a "ragtag group" of about 65 people) was secretly pushing for 386 compatibility and Windows development, despite the public commitment to OS/2 [2:51:59, 2:46:32].

The "divorce" between [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] and [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] became official in late 1990, with [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] taking full control of OS/2 [3:07:01].

This cleared the path for **Windows 3.0**, launched in 1990, to become a massive success [2:48:45]. It finally offered a truly "multitasking graphical operating environment" that could "soar" on the increasingly powerful 386 and 486 machines [2:49:42, 2:50:06]. Windows 3.0 doubled the penetration of previous Windows versions within six months, fundamentally transforming the [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM-compatible PC]] [2:49:17, 2:50:08]. This success convinced [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Bill Gates]] and [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Steve Ballmer]] to make Windows "Plan A" for [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft's]] future [2:51:50].

## The Apex: Windows 95 and Windows NT

By 1993, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] had become the world's first software company to exceed $1 billion in revenue (in fiscal 1990) [3:15:37, 3:18:05]. In January 1993, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] surpassed [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] in market capitalization, marking a symbolic "inheritance of the Earth" in computing [2:55:06, 2:55:43, 2:56:06].

### Windows NT: The Enterprise Foundation

Concurrent with Windows' growth for consumers and small businesses, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] embarked on an ambitious project for the enterprise: **Windows NT** [3:09:35]. Launched in 1993 [3:10:06], NT was a true 32-bit operating system designed for business-critical applications and networking, addressing the enterprise's need for robust, compliant computing [3:11:12]. [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] hired Dave Cutler, a legendary OS engineer from DEC, to lead its development [3:10:21]. NT laid the groundwork for Windows Server and, ultimately, [[the_emergence_of_microsoft_azure | Microsoft Azure]] [3:13:36].

### Windows 95: Mainstreaming the PC

The ultimate culmination of [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft's]] PC-era strategy was **Windows 95**, codenamed "Chicago" during development [3:24:20]. Launched on August 24, 1995, Windows 95 was a cultural phenomenon [3:03:15, 3:18:05]. The launch event in Redmond featured [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Bill Gates]] and Jay Leno, the Rolling Stones' "Start Me Up" as its theme song, and massive worldwide marketing efforts, including lighting up landmarks like the CN Tower [3:18:05, 3:20:57]. It sold a million copies in its first week and 7 million in the first month [3:26:43, 3:26:48].

Windows 95 was a significant technical leap. Unlike its predecessors, it was primarily a true 32-bit operating system, no longer just a graphical shell on top of DOS [3:28:22]. It introduced features like the "Start Menu" and aimed for user-friendliness, bringing computing to the mainstream [3:22:00, 3:22:15]. This success cemented Windows as the "franchise product" for [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] for the next two decades [3:26:21, 3:26:30]. By fiscal 1997, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] was generating $12 billion in revenue, the first software company to pass $10 billion, solidifying its status as a global technology giant [3:27:07, 3:27:11].

> [!TIP] Product-Led Growth
> The success of [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Microsoft Office]] applications like Excel and Word, which were widely adopted by individual employees, played a crucial role in [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft's]] eventual penetration of the enterprise market [3:07:32, 3:08:02]. Employees using these popular tools created a bottom-up demand that helped [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] establish its position in businesses, a precursor to modern product-led growth strategies [3:07:32, 3:08:21].

## Strategic Pillars of Windows' Dominance

The dominance of Windows was built on several strategic pillars:

*   **Counter Positioning:** [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Microsoft's]] willingness to embrace the microcomputer revolution and focus solely on software, without the baggage of existing hardware businesses, allowed it to outmaneuver [[microsofts_partnership_and_eventual_competition_with_ibm | IBM]] [3:56:11].
*   **Scale Economies:** With zero marginal cost of software and a fixed development effort, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] could amortize its costs across a massive, rapidly growing user base, leading to immense profitability [3:57:46, 3:58:18].
*   **Network Economies:** The increasing number of Windows users incentivized more developers to create applications for the platform, which in turn attracted more users, creating a powerful positive feedback loop [3:59:07]. Document formats (e.g., Word, Excel) also created strong network effects, encouraging widespread adoption [3:59:29].
*   **OEM Partnerships:** [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft's]] strategy of licensing Windows to a multitude of PC manufacturers (OEMs) allowed for unparalleled distribution and rapid market penetration [3:46:26, 3:47:16]. While [[apple_computer | Apple's]] integrated hardware-software approach offered a more polished experience, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft's]] open OEM model allowed for exponential scaling [3:46:26].
*   **Internationalization:** From its early days, [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] prioritized global expansion and localization, ensuring its products were ready for worldwide adoption [1:16:45, 3:31:30, 3:48:00]. This allowed them to amortize development costs over a vast international user base and become a global standard [3:48:29, 3:49:09].
*   **Adaptability and Learning:** [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] famously was not always first to market with its applications but was adept at learning from competitors, incorporating features, and iterating on its products [3:50:17, 3:52:51]. This strategy of continuous improvement and responsiveness to user feedback allowed them to refine their offerings until they became dominant [3:53:02].

The period from 1975 to 1995 saw [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] capitalize on a unique "perfect storm" of factors – [[the_development_and_impact_of_nvidias_cuda_architecture | Moore's Law]], the zero marginal cost of software, and the explosive secular growth of the personal computer market (98% CAGR from 1975-1986) [3:34:51, 3:39:03]. This convergence of factors allowed [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Microsoft]] to build an incredibly successful and defensible business with minimal external capital, making it "the largest company in the world... entirely bootstrapped" [3:34:11, 3:35:09, 3:35:16].

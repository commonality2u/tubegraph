Starting a paid online business, such as a subscription-based publication like Stratechery, presents numerous obstacles, ranging from market skepticism and financial strain to technical difficulties and product failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>.

## Initial Skepticism and Failed Expectations
When first launching, many people, including venture capitalists (VCs) and those in the tech industry, expressed doubt, believing "subscriptions are not a thing on the internet" and that the venture "wasn't going to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50"></a>. The founder failed to meet initial subscriber goals for one-day, one-week, and one-month periods, doing so "pretty significantly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08"></a>.

## Technical and Product Issues
The initial launch of the product was plagued with critical issues:
*   **Security Certificate Error** For the first 24 hours, a security certificate issue prevented anyone from making a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27"></a>. The site was not operable for the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04"></a>.
*   **Poor User Experience** The product itself was described as "confusing" and "janky," failing to provide a good experience for both paying and non-paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00"></a>. The founder realized the "business model's right, the product's wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16"></a>.
*   **Self-Imposed Deadlines** An "artificial deadline" set by prescheduled announcements in tech publications added unnecessary pressure and contributed to a "horrible experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a>.

After the disastrous launch, the founder "tore the whole thing out," reverted to the old website, and shifted the subscription fulfillment to daily emails, an "accidental email hack" that worked out in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58"></a>.

## Financial and Personal Strain
The decision to start a paid online business involved significant personal sacrifice:
*   **Career and Debt** The founder left a six-figure job and was burdened with business school debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19"></a>.
*   **Financial Instability** Due to the cash-centric nature of Taiwan (where the founder lived), he stopped paying credit cards to preserve cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33"></a>.
*   **Overwork** The founder worked intensely, being up 36 hours straight before launch and barely sleeping for a week, while also writing seven times a week, hosting a podcast, and handling all its editing and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48"></a>. He even considered returning to teaching English to pay bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51"></a>.
*   **Operational Errors** The first month saw more issues, including accidentally double-charging many subscribers, leading to a need for refunds and customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01"></a>.

The venture put a strain on his relationship, with his wife being "very mad" for giving up a stable job, and he hid the poor financial performance from her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57"></a>.

## Overcoming Psychological Barriers
A major hurdle was the psychological hesitation of potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04"></a>. Many people did not subscribe initially because they thought the business would fail and they would lose their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37"></a>.

This changed when the business demonstrated stability. The founder observed that once it was clear Stratechery would be an "ongoing entity," subscriber numbers saw a significant step change, with a 25% growth in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45"></a>. The founder notes that the broader acceptance of paying random internet writers, partly enabled by platforms like Substack, has been beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20"></a>.

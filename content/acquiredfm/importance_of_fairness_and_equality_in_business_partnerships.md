Fairness and equality in business partnerships, particularly within the venture capital (VC) landscape, emerged as a critical issue in Silicon Valley during the 1990s. The prevailing model of that era, where senior partners often held disproportionate control and economic benefits, led to significant resentment among younger partners and ultimately influenced the formation of new, more equitable firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Problem with Unequal Division

A 1995 New York Times article highlighted the internal politics of Silicon Valley venture firms, quoting an anonymous source who suggested that if Meryl Pickard had divided rewards more equitably, the firm wouldn't have split up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This sentiment was echoed by Robert "Bob" Cagle, a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI), who noted that at the time, resentment was palpable among younger partners over the unequal distribution of power and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Despite successes like the Microsoft deal, younger partners felt marginalized economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Bob Cagle's Crusade for Equality

Bob Cagle's personal background heavily influenced his strong belief in [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal partnership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Growing up in Flint, Michigan, with a single mother and a family working on General Motors production lines during hard times, Cagle experienced a "Hard Scrabble background" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. He was the first in his family to attend college, starting at General Motors University before moving on to Stanford Business School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. After a successful tenure at TVI, where he helped generate significant returns, Cagle felt that the senior partners were "holding on to the keys to the firm and all the economics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Cagle developed an "almost religious fervor that anything other than an [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal partnership]] was just like morally wrong for a venture capital firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. His motivation stemmed from a deep sense of fairness and a moral conviction about what was right, alongside the economic unfairness of doing the work while others reaped the majority of the financial rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## The Dissolution of TVI and the Genesis of Benchmark Capital

The internal discussions at TVI regarding an [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal partnership]] model failed to reach a resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Consequently, the firm decided to "declare Victory" and dissolve, with existing funds and board seats managed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This breakup provided an opportunity for Cagle to pursue his vision.

In early 1994, Cagle approached Bruce Dunleavy, a younger partner at Meryl Pickard, with the idea of starting a new firm based on [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal partnership]] principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Dunleavy, who had also experienced similar internal discussions at Meryl Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, was initially hesitant due to a lack of a financial safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. However, Cagle's willingness to approach a former subordinate and offer an equal partnership demonstrated his "obsessive sense of fairness" and "absurd amount of self-confidence" in the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Building an Equitable Team

Dunleavy eventually agreed but insisted on recruiting more partners, believing that a firm with just two individuals would lack the capacity for proper portfolio diversification and credibility with Limited Partners (LPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. They faced skepticism from other VCs in the valley who viewed their [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal partnership]] idea as "nuts," preferring the traditional path of working their way up within established firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

Despite this, Cagle and Dunleavy, whose "back was against the wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, recruited Andy Ratcliffe from Meryl Pickard, and crucially, Kevin Harvey, an entrepreneur who brought "entrepreneurial DNA" to the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. They also brought in Val Vaden as a fifth founding member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

In late 1994, these five individuals — Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, Kevin Harvey, and Val Vaden — formed Benchmark Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. The name itself was an audacious statement, signaling their aspiration to "set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry and how venture capital is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, particularly through their commitment to [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal economics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

The rise of Benchmark Capital highlighted that a belief in fairness and equitable structures, driven by a deep conviction rather than just economic self-interest, could lead to the formation of successful and influential new business models in the highly competitive venture capital industry.

Acquired, a podcast focused on technology companies and their playbooks, dedicated episodes in 2022 to exploring the business insights and historical journeys of Sony and Nvidia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>

## Sony Corporation

The episode on Sony Corporation was highly regarded as a "trademark acquired episode" due to its comprehensive nature, covering the company's "genius founder" and overcoming some of the greatest adversities ever discussed on the podcast, specifically Japan in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The company's journey is described as "vastly underappreciated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

### Business Diversity and Evolution
Sony's business structure is notably diverse, with five distinct business units that each contribute a double-digit percentage to both total revenue and operating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The company's story spans many chapters, from its origins in rice cookers after World War II to the creation of the PlayStation, which was not even mentioned until two hours into the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This highlights Sony's remarkable evolution and ability to pivot across various industries.

## Nvidia

The Nvidia episode was considered particularly "enlightening" due to the company's strategic decisions and forward-thinking bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

### [[nvidias_strategic_evolution_and_ai_dominance | Strategic Evolution and Big Bets]]
[[Leadership insights in tech companies | Jensen Huang]], Nvidia's CEO, notably "bet the company" three separate times, in situations where failure could have led to the company going to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. Each of these high-stakes decisions proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>:
*   **Rapid Product Development:** The first instance involved shipping a card in nine months instead of two years, with the entire design relying on emulation without prior physical testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.
*   **Technological Shift:** A second "bet the company" moment centered around programmable shaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
*   **Long-term [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI]] Investment:** The third and perhaps most impactful bet was a seven-year investment in [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI]] and Cuda, building a proprietary developer ecosystem before the market for [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI]] was fully realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. This strategic foresight played a crucial [[Role of Nvidia in AI and machine learning | role in Nvidia's AI dominance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

### [[Nvidia and the AI revolution | AI Revolution and Market Validation]]
Nvidia's stock experienced a significant surge two years prior to the episode's recording (around early 2020), primarily driven by the belief in [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI]]'s future impact rather than [[Impact of gaming on Nvidias growth | gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. Proponents who invested in Nvidia at high valuations based on [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI]]'s potential were quickly validated as [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI]] developments became more apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The emergence of tools like [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | DALL-E]] and [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | GPT-3]] (and later Chat[[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | GPT]]), with practical business applications like dynamic content rewriting, further solidified Nvidia's position in the [[Nvidia and the AI revolution | AI revolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

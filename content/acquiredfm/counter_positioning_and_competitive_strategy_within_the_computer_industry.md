## Early Industry Landscape

In 1968, the computing market was almost entirely dominated by [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]], often referred to as "Big Blue" or "Big Iron" [00:13:56]. IBM built the hardware, wrote the software (including the operating system and applications), and provided services like training and maintenance for its integrated solutions, such as the System/360 [00:14:29].

However, [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] faced antitrust scrutiny over this bundled approach [01:01:49]. Proactively, in 1968, they [[Power and competition in technology markets | unbundled hardware, software, and services]], selling them separately for the first time [01:15:32]. This decision, while seemingly minor, "cracked the door" for customers to buy hardware from IBM and software from other providers, laying the groundwork for future competitive dynamics [00:15:42].

Around the same time, Digital Equipment Corporation ([[comparison_of_tech_industry_cultures_and_strategies | DEC]]) emerged as a disruptive force [01:16:26]. DEC **counter positioned** against [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] by developing "mini-computers" â€“ machines the size of a closet, not a room, and significantly cheaper ($120,000 for a PDP-1 compared to tens of millions for an IBM mainframe) [01:18:48]. This was a classic [[Power and competition in technology markets | low-end disruption]] playbook, creating new markets for customers who didn't need IBM's full power, like branch offices or universities [01:18:11]. DEC's strategy was to "make something that's worse for most things, but better for some new things that new customers and new markets are going to care a lot about" [01:18:18].

## Microsoft's Founding and Early Counter Positioning

Microsoft's founders, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, recognized the potential of the microprocessor. Gates envisioned a future where [[Power and competition in technology markets | computing was "free"]], with a computer on every desk in every home running Microsoft software [00:31:02]. This was a radical departure from the prevailing mainframe paradigm.

Their first major step was to license their BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800, the first commercially available microcomputer [00:42:05]. The initial deal with MITS, the Altair's manufacturer, was an exclusive licensing arrangement with a capped revenue for Microsoft [00:53:30]. This limited Microsoft's revenue and exposed them to widespread **software piracy** [00:58:34].

### Learning from Experience and Early Wins

The MITS deal proved to be a critical learning experience. When the market for microcomputers exploded with the "1977 Trinity" (RadioShack TRS-80, Commodore PET, Apple II), Microsoft won an arbitration case against MITS, allowing them to license BASIC to anyone [01:08:51]. This freedom was crucial for Microsoft's **platform strategy**.

Microsoft then implemented a **"no-brainer" pricing strategy** [01:10:47]. They licensed BASIC to OEMs like Apple, Commodore, and RadioShack for low, fixed fees (e.g., $31,000 to Apple for eight years) [01:10:37]. The goal was not to maximize per-unit revenue, but to **[[Platform business models and strategies | set the standard]]** [01:10:57]. Gates believed that if Microsoft BASIC became the standard programming environment, competitors would wither, and a "positive spiral" of success would ensue due to [[Power and competition in technology markets | network effects]] [01:11:10]. This strategy worked because their [[Platform business models and strategies | low overhead]] (only five employees at the end of 1977) allowed them to take a long-term view [01:13:53].

Another early **counter position** was Microsoft's decision to **go global** in 1978, with half of their revenue coming from Japan by 1979 [01:17:36]. This move, unusual for a small company, ensured that their software was designed for international markets from the outset, further cementing their position as a global standard [01:17:53].

## The IBM PC Deal: A Masterstroke in Counter Positioning

By 1980, [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] saw the explosive growth of the microcomputer market and recognized the need to enter it [01:29:55]. To avoid disrupting their core mainframe business, [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] created a "Skunk Works" division called Project Chess in Boca Raton, Florida [01:31:39]. This team was tasked with developing the [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM Personal Computer]] (PC) within one year, using off-the-shelf components [01:32:51].

When [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] sought programming languages and an operating system, Microsoft, having no operating system of its own, initially referred them to Digital Research, maker of the CP/M OS [01:39:41]. However, a disastrous meeting between [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] and Digital Research (due to Gary Kildall's absence and licensing disputes) led [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] to return to Microsoft [01:40:04].

Microsoft seized this second chance. They quickly licensed a 16-bit operating system called QDOS (later MS-DOS) from Seattle Computer Products for $75,000 [01:45:17]. The subsequent deal with [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] was a masterstroke of **counter positioning** by Bill Gates [01:42:19]:

*   **Fixed Fee to IBM:** Microsoft charged [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] a fixed fee ($430,000) for DOS and programming languages, with **no per-copy royalties** [01:48:50]. This made DOS incredibly cheap for [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] to bundle with its PCs (costing customers only $60 compared to hundreds for rivals' OS options) [01:56:43]. This also provided plausible deniability for [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] regarding antitrust concerns [01:51:54].
*   **Retained Licensing Rights:** Crucially, Microsoft **retained the right to own and license DOS and its languages to any other company** [01:50:04].

[[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] believed its market dominance would make its PC the undisputed leader, rendering Microsoft's retained licensing rights irrelevant [01:52:50]. However, Gates correctly bet that the "[[Power and competition in technology markets | million Hardware manufacturers]]" would emerge, cloning the IBM PC (as Compaq did with the BIOS reverse-engineering) [01:52:48]. Microsoft then licensed DOS to all these "clones" on a **per-machine sold royalty basis** [02:01:12].

This strategy allowed Microsoft to use [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] to **generate demand** for their software, then use every other PC manufacturer to **capture the value** [02:01:55]. This was a profound **dislocation of the value chain**, shifting power from hardware (IBM) to software (Microsoft) [01:51:10].

## Expanding Applications and Platforms

Microsoft's success with DOS allowed them to further invest in applications. While their initial spreadsheet, Multiplan, struggled against Lotus 1-2-3 (which focused solely on the IBM PC), Microsoft learned a key lesson: **always target the next platform** [02:21:47].

This led to the development of Excel for the Macintosh, the world's first graphical spreadsheet program [02:27:31]. By focusing on the nascent graphical user interface (GUI) of the Mac, Microsoft **counter positioned** against the established DOS-based applications like Lotus 1-2-3 [02:27:26]. Microsoft was deeply involved in the Mac's development, and even licensed aspects of Apple's GUI for future versions of Windows [02:31:51]. This led to a lawsuit later, which Microsoft won [02:54:31].

### Hedging Bets: OS/2 vs. Windows

As Microsoft grew, it continued to **hedge its bets** in an uncertain technological future [02:40:03]. [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]], having lost control of the PC ecosystem to clones, sought to regain proprietary control with OS/2 [02:41:40]. They partnered with Microsoft, intending to lock Microsoft into an exclusive agreement for OS/2, making it proprietary to [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] hardware [02:42:21].

Microsoft outwardly committed to OS/2, calling it "riding the bear" [02:43:45]. However, internally, they continued to develop Windows as a **Plan B** [02:51:54]. Windows 1.0 and 2.0 (graphical interfaces running on top of DOS) were initially poor performers [02:47:45]. Meanwhile, [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]]'s strategic error in pushing the underpowered Intel 286 chip (which limited GUI capabilities) [02:45:26] allowed Compaq and other clones to leap ahead with more powerful 386 machines [02:46:03]. Microsoft secretly encouraged these clones to develop 386 systems, betting on the future of Windows [02:46:21].

The turning point came in 1990 with the release of Windows 3.0. It was unexpectedly successful, leading Microsoft to officially shift its strategy and bet on Windows as **Plan A** [02:51:50]. This marked the "divorce" from [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] and OS/2 [03:07:01].

## The Age of Windows and Enterprise Dominance

Windows 3.0's success, followed by Windows 3.1 and the groundbreaking Windows 95, cemented Microsoft's position. Windows 95, a true 32-bit operating system (not just an interface over DOS), became a global phenomenon [03:28:31]. Its launch was a marketing spectacle, treating an operating system like a major consumer product [03:20:57]. This era also saw the rise of the consumer PC, with multimedia and gaming [03:15:37].

Microsoft's transition to a dominant enterprise player was largely driven by **product-led growth** [03:07:40]. Employees were already using Microsoft Office applications (Excel, Word) in businesses [03:08:04]. Steve Ballmer led the charge to build a direct and indirect salesforce, partner with consultants, and develop enterprise-specific software (like Windows NT Server) to sell to large organizations [03:03:12]. This **counter positioned** Microsoft directly against [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]]'s traditional mainframe dominance [03:02:07].

By 1993, Microsoft passed [[Power and competition in technology markets | IBM]] in market capitalization, inheriting the throne of the computing industry [02:55:43]. This success was built on a combination of factors:
*   **[[Platform business models and strategies | Network effects]]**: More users attracted more developers, creating a virtuous cycle [03:58:50].
*   **[[Power and competition in technology markets | Scale economies]]**: Fixed development costs amortized across a massive global user base [03:57:46].
*   **[[Power and competition in technology markets | Switching costs]]**: Once users adopted Windows and Office, switching to competitors became increasingly difficult [03:58:29].
*   **Relentless iteration**: Microsoft consistently improved its products, often releasing new versions of software that were significantly better than their predecessors [03:53:01].
*   **Talent magnet**: Attracting top engineers and business minds [03:44:56].

Microsoft's strategy was not always to be first to market, but to learn from competitors, improve, and then dominate through superior product and market penetration, especially during platform shifts [03:51:50]. They famously copied features and even keyboard shortcuts to ease the transition for users from rival products [03:50:39].

The period from 1975 to 1986 saw PC shipments grow at a compound annual growth rate of 98%, from 4,000 to 9 million units per year [03:39:24]. Microsoft's ability to position itself as the **"lynchpin" or "choke point"** of this exploding industry, owning the software that ran on virtually every PC, allowed it to capture immense value and achieve unprecedented success [03:40:00].

This article explores the **investment philosophies and business strategies** of [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Charlie Munger]] and Warren Buffett, focusing on Berkshire Hathaway's approach and how it has inspired Tiny, a modern holding company.

## Tiny: The Berkshire Hathaway of the Internet

Tiny is described as the "Berkshire Hathaway of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:58">[02:48:58]</a>. The company's founders, Andrew Wilkinson and Chris, started their version of an "Internet textile mill" with Metalab, a premier design agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:53">[03:07:53]</a>. They modeled their strategy after [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Charlie Munger]] and Warren Buffett, realizing that the internet offers "wonderful niche businesses with great cash flows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:43">[03:28:43]</a>.

### Tiny's Business Model

Tiny's strategy is similar to Berkshire's in that it focuses on acquiring profitable internet businesses that often require "zero capital reinvestment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:97">[03:38:97]</a> and can build global brands faster than traditional businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:73">[03:42:73]</a>.

Key aspects of Tiny's approach include:
*   **Permanent Holding Company** Tiny aims to be the "world's first and best permanent holding company for wonderful internet businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:77">[03:53:77]</a>.
*   **Experience and Reputation** Like Berkshire, Tiny has a unique combination of "experience, temperament, access to capital, and frankly reputation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:90">[04:09:90]</a>.
*   **Simple Diligence** Tiny commits to "simple diligence, 30-day deals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:88">[04:50:88]</a>.
*   **Operational Autonomy** Acquired businesses are left alone, either for the original founders to operate or for new long-term management to be brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:79">[04:53:79]</a>.

Examples of Tiny's acquisitions include:
*   **Metalab**: A design agency that designed UIs for major companies like Slack, Uber, Tinder, Headspace, and Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>.
*   **Letterboxd**: The premier social network for film buffs, acquired by Tiny and intended to remain with its founders within Tiny's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:37">[04:37:37]</a>.

Tiny, which went public in 2023, can now do deals ranging from $1 million to $250 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:58">[05:06:58]</a>.

## Berkshire Hathaway's Investment Principles

[[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Charlie Munger]], a key figure in Berkshire Hathaway alongside Warren Buffett, offers insights into their approach to business and investment.

### Early Successes and Capital Allocation
Berkshire Hathaway, originally a textile mill, transformed into a holding company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:08">[02:59:08]</a>. Early successes included:
*   **Diversified Retail**: Berkshire bought a "little pissant department store chain in Baltimore" that was a "big mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:03">[10:44:03]</a>. However, by leveraging covenant-free debt and having extra cash, they bought their own stock when it was selling "at an enormous" discount, tripling their money by "just sitting on our ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:84">[11:06:84]</a>. This contributed to the early success of Blue Chip Stamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:82">[11:32:82]</a>.
*   **Savings and Loan Company**: An initial $2 million investment in a small savings and loan company eventually yielded over $2 billion in marketable securities, which became bedrock capital for Nebraska insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:88">[11:41:88]</a>. Munger emphasizes the importance of "wonderful early years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:07">[12:07:07]</a>.

### Patience and Conviction
[[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] highlights the rarity of truly great investment opportunities: "There aren't many times in a lifetime when you know you're right and you know you have one that's really going to work wonderfully, maybe five, six times in a lifetime you get a chance to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:09">[12:44:09]</a>. When such an opportunity arises, one "should bet heavily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:84">[15:52:84]</a>. This conviction is developed through "a lot of reading and thinking and visiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:58">[16:13:58]</a>.

### Leverage Philosophy
Berkshire Hathaway has historically been conservative with leverage, preferring not to "screw up our basic shelter position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:69">[17:15:69]</a>. However, [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] acknowledges that using "a little bit more leverage throughout we'd have three times as much now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:44">[17:02:44]</a>. He also points out that businesses like Costco operate with inherent leverage, as they have "no investment in them" and make suppliers wait for payment, effectively using supplier capital instead of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:72">[17:43:72]</a>.

### Buy and Hold Strategy
Berkshire's reputation is built on "staying with things" and rarely selling businesses once acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:58">[23:36:58]</a>. If a business is a "problem business we've never able to fix we'll sell it but it's a halfway decent business we never sell anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:28:34">[23:28:34]</a>. This "Buy and Hold" demonstration aligns investors with managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:91">[23:40:91]</a>.

### Specific Investments and Views

#### See's Candies
The acquisition of See's Candies for $20 million was a formative experience for Berkshire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:84">[34:07:84]</a>. They discovered they could raise prices by 10% annually without losing customers, significantly increasing profits without requiring new capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:15">[34:16:15]</a>. This opportunity arose because the family needed liquidity to pay death taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:04">[35:10:04]</a>.

#### Japanese Trading Houses
[[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] considers Berkshire's investment in Japanese trading houses a "no-brainer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:17">[30:46:17]</a>. With Japanese interest rates at half a percent for 10 years and these entrenched companies paying 5% dividends from assets like copper mines and rubber plantations, Berkshire could borrow cheaply and earn a substantial cash flow with "no investment, no thought, no anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:42">[30:57:42]</a>. Berkshire's credit allowed them to access this opportunity, which took patience to build into a $10 billion investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:06">[31:39:06]</a>.

#### Apple
Berkshire's investment in Apple reflects the need for "significant participation in the 12 companies to do better than everybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:14:48">[41:14:48]</a>. [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] states that Apple was a "logical candidate" when it became "cheap" at about 10 times earnings around 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:03">[42:11:03]</a>.

#### Retail Investments
Warren Buffett generally dislikes retailing, fearing its difficulty and susceptibility to disruption, as seen with the decline of many once-mighty retailers like Sears Roebuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:06">[10:06:06]</a>.
*   **Costco**: Despite Buffett's aversion to retail, [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] was a strong advocate for Costco, viewing it as one of the few truly great investment opportunities in a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:09">[12:44:09]</a>. He appreciated Price Club's (which merged with Costco) model of selling cheaper than anyone else, efficient large stores, wide parking spaces, and special benefits for members, all contributing to a "capital light business model" with "no investment in them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. Costco's strategy of low-skew count, high inventory turnover, and getting suppliers to carry inventory makes it effectively leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:37">[14:50:37]</a>.
    *   **Management & Culture**: The success of Costco is attributed to a combination of its business model, culture, and "very reliable hardworking determined execution for 40 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:24:25">[49:24:25]</a>. A central norm was "don't raise the market, get it low and keep it there forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:13">[49:52:13]</a>.
    *   **Growth Rate**: Costco's growth is inherently limited by the difficulty of opening new stores (new managers, new politics, learning, teaching) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:49">[50:47:49]</a>.
    *   **China Entry**: Jim Sinegal, then CEO of Costco, initially refused to enter China for 30 years after an attempt to open the first store encountered a demand for a $30,000 bribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:15:37">[51:15:37]</a>. The board later agitated for entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:36:20">[51:36:20]</a>.
    *   **Target Audience**: From the Price Club days, the aim was to attract "the rich man trying to save money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:11:39">[52:11:39]</a>, resulting in a wealthy, smart, and picky customer base.
*   **Walmart**: Walmart struggled to copy Costco's success because they were too "wetted by the ideas they already had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:05">[28:21:05]</a>. Their model relied on cheap real estate in small towns, which clashed with Costco's strategy of specializing in expensive, good locations in rich suburbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:07">[28:46:07]</a>.
*   **Home Depot / Floor & Decor**: Home Depot successfully copied the "Costco model" for home improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:63">[26:33:63]</a>. Floor & Decor is a current imitator focusing on vinyl wood flooring, also using the Costco model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:03:00">[27:03:00]</a>.

#### Auto Industry
The auto business is seen as difficult to invest in due to the disruption from electric cars, new capital requirements, different selling methods, and tough unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>.
*   **BYD**: Berkshire invested in BYD, a Chinese company manufacturing batteries and electric vehicles. [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] views BYD's founder as a "genius" with a high IQ and the ability to reverse-engineer parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:07">[30:10:07]</a>. Despite initial reluctance from Munger, who advised against entering the car business, BYD's founder proceeded and succeeded fabulously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:55:04">[55:55:04]</a>. This investment, though in a public company, was a "venture capital type play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:34:64">[55:34:64]</a>.
*   **Hyundai**: [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] invested in Hyundai but "lost money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:72">[30:29:72]</a>, holding out until he could sell close to his purchase price.

#### Newspapers
In its heyday, the newspaper business was a "gold mine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52:15">[59:52:15]</a>. Berkshire's experience with the Buffalo Evening News, where they started a Sunday edition despite a competitor, led to a "holy war" but ultimately cemented their local monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:16:32">[59:16:32]</a>.

#### Solomon Brothers
The Solomon Brothers crisis was a "close miss" for Berkshire, where the entire franchise was at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:20:80">[58:20:80]</a>. [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] however, believes Berkshire would have survived even if the investment had gone to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:50:06">[58:50:06]</a>.

## Comparison with Venture Capital

[[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] is critical of the venture capital industry, stating it is "very poorly done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:47">[21:04:47]</a>. He believes many venture capitalists are seen by founders as self-serving rather than true partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:06">[22:56:06]</a>.

Key criticisms include:
*   **Fee Structures**: Charging high fees (e.g., 2% management fee plus 20% carry, or "2 and 20" / "3 and 30") allows VC firms to make "very handsome loadings themselves," but endowments often do not get a good return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:27">[24:25:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of Value**: [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] argues that unless one can achieve "very unusual results," charging extra fees is unjustifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:34">[24:45:34]</a>. The ease of charging fees attracts the "wrong people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:85">[25:02:85]</a>.
*   **Short-term Focus**: Many VCs are more like investment bankers, constantly seeking the next "hot new area" rather than being great investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:59">[25:09:59]</a>.

Endowments are pushing back, negotiating lower fees and asking VCs to invest alongside them (pari passu) for a portion of the returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:19">[25:24:19]</a>.

## The Modern Investment Landscape

[[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] observes that the investment world is significantly harder now than in the past, with "so much capital and so much competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:96">[11:13:96]</a>. The "cigar butt era" of easy opportunities is long gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:96">[11:14:96]</a>.

*   **Scarcity of Opportunities**: Finding bonanza opportunities like Home Depot or Costco is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:39">[28:10:39]</a>. The "low-hanging fruit" is "very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:15">[42:49:15]</a>.
*   **Concentration of Capital**: There is a natural tendency for capital to concentrate in a few dominant companies, leading to "trillion-dollar companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:03:13">[43:03:13]</a>. This concentration is a natural outcome of human nature and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:07">[43:27:07]</a>.
*   **Difficulty of Prediction**: Most businesses today face "a lot of change and threat in their future," making predictability difficult compared to 50 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   **Pessimism**: [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] suggests it's not too pessimistic to believe the world is "out of good ideas to match the amount of capital out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>; it's "likely" and "actually happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. The current system, much like biology, gets "smart" through "brutal competition," which is "unpleasant to the people who are losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.

Ultimately, [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] concludes that investing was "never easy" and is "harder now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. The goal is to "get rich once," not repeatedly climb the mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.# Investment in Berkshire Hathaway and Tiny's Business Model

This article explores the [[Investment philosophies and business strategies | investment philosophies and business strategies]] of [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Charlie Munger]] and Warren Buffett, focusing on Berkshire Hathaway's approach and how it has inspired Tiny, a modern holding company.

## Tiny: The Berkshire Hathaway of the Internet

*   **Letterboxd**: The premier social network for film buffs, acquired by Tiny and intended to remain with its founders within Tiny's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:37">[04:37:37]</a>.

Tiny, which went public in 2023, can now do deals ranging from $1 million to $250 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:58">[05:06:58]</a>.

Warren Buffett generally dislikes retailing, fearing its difficulty and susceptibility to disruption, as seen with the decline of many once-mighty retailers like Sears Roebuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:06">[10:06:06]</a>.

Their model relied on cheap real estate in small towns, which clashed with Costco's strategy of specializing in expensive, good locations in rich suburbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:07">[28:46:07]</a>.
*   **Home Depot / Floor & Decor**: Home Depot successfully copied the "Costco model" for home improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:63">[26:33:63]</a>. Floor & Decor is a current imitator focusing on vinyl wood flooring, also using the Costco model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:03:00">[27:03:00]</a>.

#### Auto Industry
The auto business is seen as difficult to invest in due to the disruption from electric cars, new capital requirements, different selling methods, and tough unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>.
*   **BYD**: Berkshire invested in BYD, a Chinese company manufacturing batteries and electric vehicles. [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] views BYD's founder as a "genius" with a high IQ and the ability to reverse-engineer parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:07">[30:10:07]</a>. Despite initial reluctance from Munger, who advised against entering the car business, BYD's founder proceeded and succeeded fabulously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:55:04">[55:55:04]</a>. This investment, though in a public company, was a "venture capital type play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:34:64">[55:34:64]</a>.
*   **Hyundai**: [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] invested in Hyundai but "lost money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:72">[30:29:72]</a>, holding out until he could sell close to his purchase price.

#### Newspapers
In its heyday, the newspaper business was a "gold mine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52:15">[59:52:15]</a>. Berkshire's experience with the Buffalo Evening News, where they started a Sunday edition despite a competitor, led to a "holy war" but ultimately cemented their local monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:16:32">[59:16:32]</a>.

#### Solomon Brothers
The Solomon Brothers crisis was a "close miss" for Berkshire, where the entire franchise was at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:20:80">[58:20:80]</a>. [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] however, believes Berkshire would have survived even if the investment had gone to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:50:06">[58:50:06]</a>.

## Comparison with Venture Capital

[[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] is critical of the venture capital industry, stating it is "very poorly done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:47">[21:04:47]</a>. He believes many venture capitalists are seen by founders as self-serving rather than true partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:06">[22:56:06]</a>.

Key criticisms include:
*   **Fee Structures**: Charging high fees (e.g., 2% management fee plus 20% carry, or "2 and 20" / "3 and 30") allows VC firms to make "very handsome loadings themselves," but endowments often do not get a good return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:27">[24:25:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of Value**: [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] argues that unless one can achieve "very unusual results," charging extra fees is unjustifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:34">[24:45:34]</a>. The ease of charging fees attracts the "wrong people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:85">[25:02:85]</a>.
*   **Short-term Focus**: Many VCs are more like investment bankers, constantly seeking the next "hot new area" rather than being great investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:59">[25:09:59]</a>.

Endowments are pushing back, negotiating lower fees and asking VCs to invest alongside them (pari passu) for a portion of the returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:19">[25:24:19]</a>.

## The Modern Investment Landscape

[[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] observes that the investment world is significantly harder now than in the past, with "so much capital and so much competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:96">[11:13:96]</a>. The "cigar butt era" of easy opportunities is long gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:96">[11:14:96]</a>.

*   **Scarcity of Opportunities**: Finding bonanza opportunities like Home Depot or Costco is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:39">[28:10:39]</a>. The "low-hanging fruit" is "very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:15">[42:49:15]</a>.
*   **Concentration of Capital**: There is a natural tendency for capital to concentrate in a few dominant companies, leading to "trillion-dollar companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:03:13">[43:03:13]</a>. This concentration is a natural outcome of human nature and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:07">[43:27:07]</a>.
*   **Difficulty of Prediction**: Most businesses today face "a lot of change and threat in their future," making predictability difficult compared to 50 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   **Pessimism**: [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] suggests it's not too pessimistic to believe the world is "out of good ideas to match the amount of capital out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>; it's "likely" and "actually happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. The current system, much like biology, gets "smart" through "brutal competition," which is "unpleasant to the people who are losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.

Ultimately, [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Munger]] concludes that investing was "never easy" and is "harder now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. The goal is to "get rich once," not repeatedly climb the mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.

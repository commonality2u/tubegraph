The period following the [[the_gamestop_meme_stock_craze_and_wallstreetbets|GameStop meme stock craze]] saw significant congressional attention, particularly within the House Financial Services Committee. Despite multiple hearings and widespread public interest, legislative outcomes were ultimately disappointing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Focus of the Financial Services Committee

A significant portion of time on the House Financial Services Committee was dedicated to addressing various market issues. Beyond the [[the_gamestop_meme_stock_craze_and_wallstreetbets|GameStop meme stock craze]], a substantial amount of time was spent on China-related work, including reforms for international financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF, which were perceived as "overrun by China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Other key areas of focus included China capital markets and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Promise of Legislation

Following the meme stock mania, there was an expectation that legislation would emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The committee conducted a "ton of hearings" on the matter, totaling four separate sessions, indicating significant effort to understand the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These hearings garnered national media attention, reflecting the widespread interest in the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Missed Opportunities and Partisan Gridlock

Despite the detailed work and public attention, no substantive legislation came out of the meme stock events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. A key disappointment was the failure to pass a bipartisan bill that would have shortened the settlement time for trades from two days to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This change was believed to "reduce the risk in the system overall" and potentially "prevented what Robin Hood ultimately had to do," referring to trading halts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Instead, Democrats proposed a bill that bundled various legislative desires from the previous decade, which, while passing the House, was not expected to advance in the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This outcome highlights a common frustration in Washington, where issues become [[political_challenges_in_passing_financial_legislation_in_congress|political casualties]] due to partisan dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## [[congressman_anthony_gonzalezs_experience_with_online_forums_during_hearings|Congressional Hearings]] and Public Engagement

The hearings were described as "interesting" and even "fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. During remote hearings, [[congressman_anthony_gonzalezs_experience_with_online_forums_during_hearings|Congressman Anthony Gonzalez]] maintained two computers: one for the official hearing and another displaying the [[the_gamestop_meme_stock_craze_and_wallstreetbets|WallStreetBets]] forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This allowed him to observe real-time public reactions to the proceedings, including direct, often critical, commentary on members speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Notably, online commenters compared [[congressman_anthony_gonzalezs_experience_with_online_forums_during_hearings|Gonzalez]] to the character "Hitman" from the video game and movie series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

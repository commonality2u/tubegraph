Today, [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_growth | Qualcomm]]'s total annual revenue is close to $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Of this, 85% — approximately $37 billion of $44 billion — comes from its semiconductor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_growth | Qualcomm]] stands as the largest fabless Semiconductor Company globally, surpassing Nvidia, which is number two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This significant portion of their revenue would not exist without a pivotal strategic decision made in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Early Growth and CDMA Dominance

[[qualcomms_founding_and_early_history | Qualcomm]]'s early success was largely driven by the adoption of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) as a major 2G standard for mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. CDMA achieved a 57% market share in the U.S. in 2G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, 100% market share in countries like South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, and a massive market share in China as the country began adopting mobile technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The first CDMA networks went live in 1995 in the U.S. and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This immediately impacted [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_growth | Qualcomm]]'s revenue:
*   1995: $383 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   1996: $814 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

Despite this growth, [[performance_of_qualcomm_stock_during_the_tech_bubble | Qualcomm's stock]] remained largely flat, with Wall Street disliking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The manufacturing operations and joint ventures (JVs) required significant capital, tying up all company profits, which punished the stock until January 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Strategic Shift to a Fabless Model and Patent Licensing

In 1999, [[qualcomms_strategic_business_decisions_in_1999 | Qualcomm]] recognized that its capital-intensive manufacturing operations for phones and base stations were a drag on its business, funneling money that could be free cash flow or reinvested in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This led to significant strategic changes:
*   **March 1999**: [[qualcomms_strategic_business_decisions_in_1999 | Qualcomm]] sold its infrastructure business (base stations) to Ericsson, a former competitor, as part of a licensing and settlement deal for past lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This move transferred 1,000 of [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_growth | Qualcomm]]'s 9,500 employees to Ericsson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **December 1999**: Kyocera, a Japanese company, purchased [[qualcomms_strategic_business_decisions_in_1999 | Qualcomm]]'s mobile phone business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

These sales marked a pivotal moment, officially establishing [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_growth | Qualcomm]]'s future business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:
1.  **Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Group (QTC)**: Selling high-margin semiconductor designs (chips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Being fabless, they do not manufacture the semiconductors themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
2.  **Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)**: Licensing their extensive patent portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This model allows them to charge a percentage of the phone's selling price (e.g., 5%) in addition to licensing fees for their patents, leveraging their ownership of essential technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Continued Technological Leadership and Product Expansion

In the 2000s, [[qualcomms_technological_innovations_and_patents | Qualcomm]] continued its leadership in mobile technology:
*   **3G Dominance**: While there was debate between GSM and CDMA for 3G, essentially all 3G networks globally became CDMA, driven by CDMA's superior efficiency for broadband internet data speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **4G Patent Acquisition**: In 2005, [[qualcomms_strategic_business_decisions_in_1999 | Qualcomm]] acquired Flarion Technologies for $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This acquisition provided [[qualcomms_technological_innovations_and_patents | Qualcomm]] with essential patents for 4G (based on OFDMA, a more efficient technology than CDMA for later generations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This allowed them to maintain their business model by owning the necessary patents for future generations of mobile technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Snapdragon Development**: Under CEO Paul Jacobs (2005-2013/14) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_growth | Qualcomm]] began building the Snapdragon line of mobile systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This placed them in a strong position for the modern smartphone era, as Snapdragon chips became the standard for high-end Android phones, complementing Apple's A-series chips for iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_growth | Qualcomm]] now brands a wide range of its silicon engineering and chip designs under the Snapdragon label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

Today, [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_growth | Qualcomm]] generates, on average, about $20 for every smartphone sold globally, including Apple iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. While they are celebrated as pioneers of technology, [[legal_challenges_faced_by_qualcomm | Qualcomm]] has also faced [[legal_challenges_faced_by_qualcomm | litigation]] and been viewed by customers and the media as "value capture pioneers," or "maximally extractive over their ecosystem" due to their aggressive patent licensing practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Qualcomm's current business is dominated by its [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor]] operations, which account for approximately 85% of its nearly $40 billion in annual revenue, translating to around $37 billion of $44 billion in total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This revenue stream, which would not exist without a key strategic decision, has established Qualcomm as the world's largest fabless [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor]] company, surpassing even Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Early Growth and Operational Challenges

Initially, Qualcomm's business model included significant manufacturing operations. The company saw rapid revenue growth following the adoption of CDMA as a major 2G standard, which came out in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>. Qualcomm achieved a 57% market share in the US for 2G and 100% in countries like South Korea, along with a massive market share in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.

Revenue soared from $383 million in 1995 to $814 million in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. However, Wall Street did not favor the stock during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>. The reason was the substantial capital required for manufacturing operations and joint ventures, which tied up the company's profits, punishing the stock until early 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a>.

## The Strategic Pivot: Exiting Manufacturing (1999)

By 1999, Qualcomm recognized that its capital-intensive manufacturing operations for phones and base stations were a significant drag on its business, funneling money that could otherwise be free cash flow or reinvested in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:11">[02:07:11]</a>. This realization led to a pivotal shift:

### Sale of Infrastructure Business
In March 1999, Qualcomm sold its infrastructure business (base stations) to Ericsson, a former competitor. This sale was part of a settlement deal resolving numerous lawsuits between the two companies. Qualcomm's decision reflected a belief that it no longer needed manufacturing to bootstrap its strategy, having gained sufficient momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>. As a result, 1,000 of Qualcomm's 9,500 employees transferred to Ericsson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:21">[03:01:21]</a>.

### Sale of Mobile Phone Business
In December 1999, Kyocera, a Japanese company, acquired Qualcomm's mobile phone business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>. With this sale, Qualcomm officially transitioned to a business model focused on two core areas:

*   **Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Group (QTC)**: This group sells [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor]] chips and designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:33">[03:48:33]</a>.
*   **Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)**: This group manages the high-margin licensing of Qualcomm's extensive patent portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:19">[03:51:19]</a>.

This established business model meant Qualcomm no longer had the financial drag of manufacturing operations, and they focused on selling high-margin [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor]] designs, famously not fabricating any of the [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semis]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

Qualcomm's licensing model involved charging a percentage of phone sales (e.g., 5%) rather than a flat fee per chip, leveraging their patent ownership to command these terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Post-Transition Performance and Dominance

### Stock Performance and 3G Adoption
Following the offloading of the handset business, Qualcomm's stock experienced an extraordinary surge. In the year 2000, during the height of the dot-com bubble, Qualcomm was the single best-performing stock, appreciating by 2621% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:17">[05:51:17]</a>. This represented a 26.2x increase in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:44">[06:23:44]</a>.

The next generation of mobile networks, 3G, saw CDMA become the dominant worldwide standard, driven by its superior efficiency for broadband internet data speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:24">[07:08:24]</a>. CDMA's digital nature was perfectly suited for the packet-based data transmission required for internet browsing and messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:03">[07:44:03]</a>.

### Paul Jacobs Era and Maintaining Patent Dominance
In 2005, Irwin Jacobs, Qualcomm's co-founder, retired as CEO, and his son, Paul Jacobs, an electrical engineer, took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:58">[08:13:58]</a>. Also in 2005, Qualcomm strategically acquired Flarian Technologies for $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:48">[08:50:48]</a>. This acquisition was crucial for securing patents essential for 4G technology, specifically OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing), which superseded CDMA as the more efficient standard for 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:37">[09:15:37]</a>. This move allowed Qualcomm to continue its business model by owning many of the patents required for 4G and LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:16">[09:51:16]</a>.

Although Paul Jacobs's tenure (2005-2013/14) is viewed with mixed light, largely due to a strategic focus on IoT that hadn't yet materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:05">[10:06:05]</a>, two key developments occurred:
1.  **Strategic Pivot to OFDMA**: Despite initially fighting against it, Qualcomm pivoted to embrace OFDMA, securing its position in 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:40">[10:41:40]</a>.
2.  **Snapdragon Development**: The company began building the Snapdragon line of mobile systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and CPUs. These early predecessors to smartphones positioned Qualcomm strongly for the modern smartphone era, making them the primary high-end chip supplier for Android phones today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:30">[10:58:30]</a>.

Today, Qualcomm earns an average of about $20 for every smartphone sold globally, including Apple iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:44">[12:09:44]</a>. This dual revenue stream from chip designs and patent licensing has cemented Qualcomm's role as a major player in the [[comparison_of_qualcomm_and_the_global_semiconductor_industry | global semiconductor industry]] by perfecting the [[the_evolution_of_the_semiconductor_industry_and_the_rise_of_the_fabless_model | fabless model]] and highly lucrative patent licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Their approach to value capture through patents has led to significant litigation, where they are seen by customers and media as "value capture pioneers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:10">[12:29:10]</a>.

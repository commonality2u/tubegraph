[[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]], a leading semiconductor foundry, has built its success on a foundation of strategic partnerships and industry collaborations. These relationships, often forged through direct engagement and long-term vision, have been crucial in navigating technological advancements, market demands, and competitive pressures.

## Key Partnerships and Collaborations

### [[Nvidia]]
The relationship between [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] and [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] began with a letter from [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] CEO Jensen Huang to Morris Chang in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:40">[03:43:40]</a>. At the time, [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] was a small company with 50-60 employees facing bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, while [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] was already a multi-billion dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Huang sought a foundry for their promising chips after their request to [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s San Jose office went unanswered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

Morris Chang was impressed by Jensen Huang's articulateness and optimism, especially his bold prediction that [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] would become a major [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. [[Nvidia | Nvidia]]'s first successful "games chip" not only saved the company from bankruptcy but also made them one of [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s top five biggest customers within two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. This established a strong partnership where [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] manufactured the chips designed by [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

However, the partnership faced a significant challenge in 2009 with manufacturing and quality problems on the 40-nanometer node, affecting customers like [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Upon returning as CEO in 2009, Morris Chang prioritized resolving this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. After familiarizing himself with the problem, he offered [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] over $100 million in compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a>, with a 48-hour acceptance window before resorting to arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>. Jensen Huang accepted the offer within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:24:00">[35:24:00]</a>, leading to a continued successful partnership and billions of dollars in subsequent business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>.

### Apple
[[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]]'s relationship with [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] began with an unexpected meeting in late 2010. While [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] had been contemplating how to secure [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]'s business for their iPhone chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>, [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] was known for being a "close-mouth company" that would only engage when ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.

The initial contact came when Terry Gou, founder and CEO of Foxconn and a second cousin to Morris Chang's wife, arranged a dinner meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. Terry Gou brought Jeff Williams, then [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]'s Chief Operating Officer, to Morris Chang's home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>. Williams' pitch was straightforward: [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] wanted [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] to produce chips, initially suggesting a 40% gross margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>. This was less than [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]]'s existing 45% margin, which Morris Chang was trying to push to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>.

A surprising request from [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] was for [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] to develop a 20-nanometer node. This was a "half-step" detour from [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]]'s planned progression from 28nm directly to 16nm, which would require significant effort and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. At the time, [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]]'s R&D capabilities were not strong enough to pursue two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>.

To fund the additional capital expenditure required for the 20nm node, [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] consulted with Goldman Sachs and decided to borrow money by issuing corporate bonds, rather than cutting dividends or selling new stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. Morris Chang decided to serve only half of [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]'s initial demand for the 20nm process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:23">[01:25:23]</a>, a decision that Jeff Williams accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>.

In February 2011, Jeff Williams informed Morris Chang that discussions would be paused for two months as Intel had approached Tim Cook to consider them as a supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>. Despite Intel's historical dominance, Morris Chang was not overly concerned. He believed [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] was at parity with Intel in technology, superior in manufacturing, and had greater customer trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:10">[01:40:10]</a>. A month later, Morris Chang met with Tim Cook, who explained that "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>, a statement Chang interpreted as a lack of responsiveness and customer-centricity from Intel compared to [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:47">[01:45:47]</a>. This ultimately led to [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] becoming [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]'s sole supplier for chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a>.

The decision to pursue the 20nm node for [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] did have a significant tradeoff: it delayed [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]]'s 16nm node development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. This allowed Samsung to take an initial lead in the 16nm technology, securing early [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>. However, Jeff Williams reassured Morris Chang that [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] would buy from [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] once their 16nm process was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>. Indeed, [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]]'s 16nm process was ready about half a year later, and they secured most of [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]'s 16nm requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:42">[01:54:42]</a>. This highlights [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]]'s "Pure Play Foundry" model, where they do not compete with their customers, unlike Samsung, which is a direct competitor to [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] in end products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:08">[01:55:08]</a>.

### Qualcomm
[[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] actively pursued [[visas_global_expansion_and_strategic_partnerships | Qualcomm]] as a customer in the 1990s, recognizing them as a technology house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:05">[01:56:05]</a>. Despite frequent meetings, [[visas_global_expansion_and_strategic_partnerships | Qualcomm]] gave [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] very little business, as their main foundry was IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:33">[01:57:33]</a>. In the late 1990s (around 1997-1998), [[visas_global_expansion_and_strategic_partnerships | Qualcomm]]'s business with [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] began to increase rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:04">[01:58:04]</a>. This shift signaled to Morris Chang that IBM's semiconductor business was in trouble, as [[visas_global_expansion_and_strategic_partnerships | Qualcomm]] was a major client for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:41">[01:58:41]</a>.

### IBM and UMC
In 1999, IBM approached [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] to co-develop the next generation of technology (0.13 micron / 130 nanometer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:31">[01:59:31]</a>. Morris Chang declined the offer, anticipating difficulties due to cultural differences and IBM's expectation of being the "senior partner," which would force [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s engineers to work at IBM and potentially hinder [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s independent process development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. IBM then approached UMC, who accepted the co-development, only to regret it seriously later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>. At this point, UMC was already smaller than [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:54">[02:01:54]</a>.

### Goldman Sachs
[[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] established a good relationship with Goldman Sachs early in its existence, with Morris Chang even serving as a board director for Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:10">[02:11:10]</a>. This relationship proved valuable for financial advice, especially when [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] needed to raise significant capital to expand for customers like [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:02">[02:12:02]</a>.

### Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the Learning Curve
Morris Chang's understanding of the "learning curve theory" was deeply influenced by his collaboration with Bruce Henderson, founder of Boston Consulting Group (BCG), and Bill Bain, who later founded Bain & Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:09">[02:04:09]</a>. While at Texas Instruments in the early 1970s, Morris Chang was assigned to work with Bill Bain, who spent several days a week at TI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a>. This two-year association allowed Chang to absorb and refine the learning curve concept for the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:18">[02:10:18]</a>.

The core of the learning curve theory, as applied to semiconductors, states that as a company produces more of a product, its unit cost decreases due to increased efficiency and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>. [[TSMCs strategy of sacrificing current profits for future gains | This principle]] guided [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s strategy to aggressively pursue volume to achieve the lowest costs and dominate the market, even if it meant starting with unprofitable pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. The long-term goal is to out-compete and gain all customers, leading to scale economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:50">[02:38:50]</a>.

### Hsinchu Science Park Ecosystem
The success of [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] is deeply intertwined with the integrated ecosystem of the Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan. This government-sponsored industrial park hosts not only [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s facilities but also its partners and customers, such as Synopsys, Cadence, ARM, [[visas_global_expansion_and_strategic_partnerships | Qualcomm]], and Mediatek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:03">[02:28:03]</a>. The close physical proximity facilitates "extremely close communication" and integration, which is critical for developing new process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:07">[02:29:07]</a>. The park also includes two universities that produce PhDs directly absorbed into the ecosystem, further strengthening its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>. This localized integration is a key factor that makes it challenging to replicate [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s capabilities elsewhere, making it an "unlikely success of grand scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>.

Morris Chang foresaw the rise of the "fabless" business model, where companies design chips without owning fabrication plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>. This vision was solidified by early interactions with entrepreneurs like Gordon Campbell (who decided not to build a fab and only needed $5 million in funding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:29">[02:18:29]</a> and a company called ATM that sought General Instrument to manufacture wafers for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:52">[02:18:52]</a>. This insight positioned [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] to capitalize on the emerging fabless revolution by building the necessary manufacturing capacity and competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:50">[02:36:50]</a>.

### [[Role of TSMC in the technology ecosystem | TSMC]]'s Role in the Industry
[[Role of TSMC in the technology ecosystem | TSMC]]'s dedication to being a "Pure Play Foundry" (not competing with its customers by designing its own chips or end products) is considered a primary reason for its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. This model allowed [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] to become a trusted, neutral manufacturing partner for a wide array of companies. The rise of ARM architecture also played a crucial role, creating a dominant platform for which [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] could become the dedicated foundry, unlike the vertically integrated x86 dominance of Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:51">[02:24:51]</a>.

[[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]]'s continued investment in R&D (setting a fixed 8% of revenue for R&D budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:41">[02:08:41]</a> and massive capital expenditures (ramping to almost $6 billion in 2010 from previous $2-2.5 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:52">[04:29:52]</a> have allowed it to maintain its leading position in advanced nodes. This strategy aligns with the "Moore's Law" principle that the world demands exponentially increasing computing power, creating a self-reinforcing system where market incentives drive supply-side innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:11">[02:44:11]</a>.

Visa is the 11th most valuable company globally, surpassing any bank, including those instrumental in its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Its brand is recognized for reliability and security worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Despite its immense importance, many people cannot articulate what Visa does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Visa does not extend credit, issue cards, or work directly with merchants or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. It is not a bank or a financial institution and does not bear any risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Instead, Visa primarily functions as a network connecting banks to other banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## Origins: The "Fresno Drop" and BankAmericard

The story of Visa begins in September 1958 in Fresno, California, with what is known as "the drop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Bank of America, then the largest bank in America, mailed out small rectangular plastic pieces, which were credit cards, to all 65,000 of its customers in Fresno, completely unsolicited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. At the time, Fresno's population was around 200,000-250,000, meaning a significant portion of the city banked with Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

Historically, transferring money in the US was difficult, limited to cash or checks, which had issues like discounts due to processing costs and slow transfer times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. Merchants often used charge accounts for regular customers, which evolved into branded cards for chains (e.g., Standard Oil in 1939 sent out 250,000 unsolicited cards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. Later, groups of retailers formed joint charge account systems, leading to the need for third-party networks like Diner's Club (1949) and American Express (1958) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>. These early cards, however, were "charge cards" requiring full payment at the end of the month, not "credit cards" with rolling loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.

Bank of America's motivation for the Fresno drop was twofold: to streamline its diverse consumer lending programs (like washing machine or refrigerator loans) and to increase its loan volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:00">[27:34:00]</a>. The "BankAmericard," as it was called, allowed customers to roll over balances into loans, birthing the modern credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>. This system also allowed Bank of America to retain the "float" as transactions often occurred between its own cardholders and merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.

The Fresno pilot initially faced massive fraud and delinquency rates, with 22% of issued credit defaulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>. However, unlike smaller banks, Bank of America could absorb these losses due to its scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>. The program became profitable by 1961, though Bank of America kept this quiet, leading other banks to abandon similar efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>.

## The Evolution to a Network: De Hawk's Vision

In 1966, Bank of America unveiled its grand plan: to license the BankAmericard program and network to other banks across the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>. This "BankAmericard Service Organization" (BASO) charged a franchise fee and a percentage of gross transaction revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a>. By 1968, hundreds of banks had signed up, along with Barclay's Bank in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:18:00">[44:18:00]</a>.

The expansion quickly revealed limitations. In California, Bank of America controlled both sides of transactions, but with multiple banks involved, a system for "interchange" (settling transactions between different banks) was desperately needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>. Bank of America, however, provided no such service, viewing it as the licensees' problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:46:00">[47:46:00]</a>.

In October 1968, disgruntled licensees demanded a summit in Columbus, Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:00">[56:26:00]</a>. Bank of America sent only mid-level marketing managers, signaling their lack of seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:19:00">[57:19:00]</a>. Here, [[De Hawk | Dee Hock]], a manager from a small Seattle bank (later Rainier Bank), emerged. He proposed that the licensees' committee, rather than just airing grievances, design and propose a new operational model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

Hock realized the fundamental problem was organizing a diverse set of competing banks to collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. His vision: a transcendental organization linking institutions and individuals in new ways to unlock immense value from global payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Hock, an outsider with humble beginnings and a talent for debate, convinced Bank of America to relinquish control of the BankAmericard program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>.

The new entity, National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI), was structured as a for-profit non-stock Membership Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. Ownership was based on "irrevocable non-transferable rights of participation," meaning membership and transaction volume, rather than stock, determined influence and profit share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. This structure was designed to prevent banks from selling their interest and ensure continued participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>. It was a self-organizing body with democratic governance (80% vote for changes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>.

The mission was to facilitate cooperation and trust among competitors to grow the network beyond any single institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a>. Crucially, it initially prohibited banks from participating in competing networks, fostering exclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. Hock successfully persuaded all 200+ existing BankAmericard franchisees to join NBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. He even secured a "hall pass" from the Department of Justice, arguing that the cooperative network would benefit American consumers and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:38">[01:24:38]</a>.

In 1972, Hock formed a parallel international organization, making Visa global from nearly day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. The name "Visa" was chosen in 1976 because it was universally recognized and implied global acceptance ("everywhere you want to be") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a>. This rebranding and the mandatory migration of BankAmericards to Visa cards triggered a massive growth spurt, with the number of participating banks growing by 20% and active cardholders by 45% in just one year (1977-1978), allowing Visa to surpass MasterCharge (later Mastercard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:13">[01:37:13]</a>.

## Technological Backbone: Visanet and Beyond

Visa's growth depended on significant technological advancements. Initially, transaction authorizations were manual, relying on "floor limits" (cashiers could approve transactions below a certain amount) and lengthy phone calls between merchant banks and card-issuing banks for larger purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. This process was slow and didn't work outside business hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>.

In 1971, Hock initiated the BankAmericard Authorization System Experimental (BASE) project to automate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. After failed attempts with external vendors and a DOJ-scuttled joint venture with American Express, Visa built the technology in-house under Aram Tulan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:17">[01:56:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:13">[01:57:13]</a>. This involved building a global telecom network, installing computer systems in banks, and establishing a centralized data center in San Mateo, California (still Visa's headquarters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:28">[01:57:28]</a>. Completed in just nine months, this system, later known as Visanet, eliminated bank-to-bank phone calls for authorizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:26">[01:58:26]</a>.

The next challenge was automating settlement. Project Base 2, developed concurrently, created a private Automated Clearing House (ACH) for Visa, reducing settlement time from a week to overnight batch processing, saving millions in labor and postage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:15">[01:59:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:08">[02:03:08]</a>. Visa also pioneered actively redundant, concurrent data centers across different geographies to ensure 99.999% uptime, a practice now standard in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:20">[02:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:25">[02:51:25]</a>.

Finally, Visa facilitated the digitization of the point of transaction. This involved standardizing on magnetic stripe technology for cards and creating a specification for digital point-of-sale (POS) terminals, leading to the rise of companies like Verifone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:37">[02:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:17">[02:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:20">[02:10:20]</a>. To incentivize merchants, Visa offered discounts on transaction fees for digital processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:04">[02:11:04]</a>. They even rented network capacity from CompuServe for their merchant telecom network in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. These advancements drastically cut fraud (82% reduction in chargebacks) and enabled Visa to scale infinitely with near-zero marginal costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:28">[02:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:22">[02:15:22]</a>.

## The Modern Visa Business

Visa today operates as a central hub in a five-sided system involving consumers, merchants, card-issuing banks, merchant-acquiring banks, and the Visa network itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:45">[02:35:45]</a>.

A typical transaction involves several fees for the merchant:
*   **Interchange Fees (1.6%):** The largest portion, going to the card-issuing bank (e.g., Chase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:21">[02:31:21]</a>. This covers fraud risk and incentivizes card marketing and rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:51">[02:31:51]</a>.
*   **Payment Processing Fees (0.2%):** Goes to the merchant-acquiring bank and/or their technology provider (e.g., First Data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:02">[02:32:02]</a>.
*   **Assessment/Network Fees (0.15-0.2%):** Goes to Visa itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:37">[02:32:37]</a>. This portion has very low variable costs, contributing significantly to Visa's profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:11">[02:33:11]</a>.

Different card types (e.g., premium rewards cards) often carry higher interchange fees, creating an "envelope of value" that can be distributed among ecosystem participants to incentivize desired behaviors, such as attracting higher-spending customers to merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:57">[02:36:57]</a>.

The system is difficult to change due to the alignment of incentives: consumers, especially those with rewards cards, largely benefit and advocate for the current system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:01">[02:40:01]</a>. Retailers are generally the most unhappy party, but no single retailer commands enough transaction volume to create a viable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:01">[02:40:01]</a>.

### Financial Profile
Visa processed $14 trillion in volume last year, a 17.3% compounded annual growth rate since 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:02">[02:46:02]</a>.
*   **Transactions:** Over 190 billion last year (27 per person on Earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:11">[02:47:11]</a>.
*   **Cards in Circulation:** 4.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:29">[02:47:29]</a>.
*   **Net Revenue:** $29 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>.
*   **Net Income Margins:** 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:23">[02:48:23]</a> (compared to Microsoft at 34%, Apple at 25%, Google at 21%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:52">[02:49:52]</a>.
*   **Gross Margins:** 98% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:19">[02:49:19]</a>.
*   **Employees:** 27,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:30">[02:50:30]</a>.
*   **Transactions per Day:** 707 million (8,600 per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:05">[02:51:05]</a>.
*   **Reach:** 16,000 banks in 200 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:38">[02:51:38]</a>.

## Business Power

Visa, alongside Mastercard, forms a government-enabled duopoly, making direct competition challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:09">[03:02:09]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies:** Any investment made by Visa is amortized across its vast network of 16,000 banks and 4 billion cards, making it nearly impossible for new entrants to compete on fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:42">[03:05:42]</a>.
*   **Network Economies:** Visa benefits from a rare five-sided network effect (consumers, merchants, issuing banks, acquiring banks, and the network itself), where each additional participant amplifies the value for all others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>. The complexity of building such a multi-sided network makes it virtually unbreakable once established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:05">[03:08:05]</a>.
*   **Brand:** While today it might be seen as an "ingredient brand," Visa's strategic positioning against American Express and its partnership with the Olympics (exclusive payment provider since 1986, contracted through 2032) built a powerful global brand associated with ubiquity and trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:48">[02:23:48]</a>.

## Playbook

*   **Toll Booth Business:** Visa operates as a global toll booth, where nearly all digital commerce must pass through its network, allowing it to collect fees on trillions of dollars in transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:09">[03:28:09]</a>.
*   **Communist Capitalism:** Visa is a prime example of "communist capitalism," where competing financial institutions band together under a common umbrella to create more value than they could alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:34">[03:11:34]</a>. This "democratic communist capitalism" structure, involving thousands of banks, is orders of magnitude more complex than other similar models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:57">[03:11:57]</a>.
*   **Sociotechnical Innovation:** Visa's success is a testament to both its organizational (socio) innovations in aligning diverse interests and its technological advancements in building a robust, global payment infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:50">[03:28:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:26">[03:29:26]</a>.
*   **Aligning Consumer Benefit with Business Goals:** Visa consistently frames new products and services (e.g., enhanced security, privacy features) as benefits for consumers, which simultaneously drive transaction volume, increase margins, or strengthen network lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:08">[03:11:08]</a>.

## Value Creation and Capture

Visa creates immense value by enabling seamless, instant, and secure global commerce, particularly contributing to the explosion of e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:06">[03:19:06]</a>. Without credit card networks, online payments would have been significantly delayed or impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:53">[03:19:53]</a>. The arguments for merchants to accept cards include increased spending, broader customer reach, guaranteed payment, instant authorization, and reduced operational overhead compared to cash or checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

However, Visa's ability to "capture" value has led to substantial fees. US merchants paid an estimated $93 billion in Visa and Mastercard credit card fees last year, up from $33 billion in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:27">[02:55:27]</a>. Critics argue the system is regressive; higher interchange fees, particularly from rewards cards favored by wealthier consumers, are passed on through marked-up prices, effectively meaning cash-using households subsidize card-using households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:30">[02:41:30]</a>. For small transaction items (e.g., coffee), the fixed 30-cent fee can be particularly "pernicious," sometimes exceeding the cost of goods sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:50">[03:16:50]</a>.

## Outlook: Bear and Bull Cases

### Bear Cases
*   **Maturing Core Business:** Over 50% of consumer payments now occur via cards. While Visa's revenue isn't expected to decline, the powerful tailwind of cash-to-digital conversion will slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:05">[03:21:05]</a>.
*   **Closed-Loop Systems:** The rise of super apps and closed-loop payment ecosystems like Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay in China pose a threat if similar models gain traction in other markets without relying on card networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:56">[03:21:56]</a>.
*   **Real-Time Payment Networks:** Government-mandated real-time payment networks (e.g., Brazil's Pix, India's UPI, UK's Faster Payments, US's FedNow) could disintermediate Visa, especially if they enable cross-border transfers without card networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:50">[03:24:50]</a>.
*   **Apple Pay and Google Pay:** While currently running on Visa's rails, these mobile wallets erode the card's prominence in the consumer's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:04">[03:28:04]</a>. If Apple were to acquire a POS provider like Square, they could potentially create a truly closed-loop system, cutting out Visa entirely for transactions involving Apple Card and Apple Pay at Apple's own or affiliated terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:19">[03:26:19]</a>.

### Bull Cases
*   **Tokenization:** The shift from raw card numbers to tokenized payments (e.g., Apple Pay) enhances security and privacy. This also creates opportunities for Visa to offer proprietary, high-margin "token-based services" that increase their control over the payment ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:41">[03:31:41]</a>.
*   **Untapped Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Visa aims to expand beyond consumer-to-business (B2C) payments into vastly larger segments:
    *   **Business-to-Business (B2B) Payments:** ~$120 trillion in volume, currently dominated by ACH and wire transfers. Visa seeks to capture a share with appropriate monetization models (e.g., corporate cards like Ramp or Brex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:18">[03:33:18]</a>.
    *   **Business-to-Consumer (B2C) Payments:** ~$30 trillion in volume (e.g., insurance payouts, refunds, gig worker payments). Visa Direct is a new initiative targeting these push-based payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:10">[03:34:10]</a>.
    *   **Cross-Border Payments:** International transactions are significantly more profitable for Visa due to higher margins on currency conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:41">[03:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>.
*   **Resilience and Network Power:** Visa has consistently grown at high rates despite various past "bear cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:47">[03:30:47]</a>. Its enduring, multi-sided network effect, built over 50 years, continues to be a formidable barrier to entry for any new competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:21">[03:30:21]</a>.

### Trivia
Bank of America still issues a "BankAmericard" credit card today. However, in a twist of irony stemming from industry changes and antitrust outcomes, this product runs on Mastercard's network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:52">[03:37:52]</a>.

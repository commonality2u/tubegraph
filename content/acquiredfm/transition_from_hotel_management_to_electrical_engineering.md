Irwin Mark Jacobs, born in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, embarked on an unconventional path that ultimately led him to become a foundational figure in the wireless and communications industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Early Life and Unexpected Career Advice
Growing up in a middle-class family, Jacobs was highly gifted in math and sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Despite his aptitude and desire to study math and science, his high school guidance counselor famously told him there was "no future" for those fields in New Bedford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Given his excellent grades, the counselor encouraged him to attend the world-famous Cornell School of Hotel Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The idea was that he would learn hospitality management and return to work in his family's restaurant, the Boston Beef Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## The Transformative Year in Hotel Management
Jacobs initially followed this advice, enrolling in Cornell's hotel management school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He spent a year and a half in the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Surprisingly, he would later credit this period as crucial for his future entrepreneurial success with his first company and later Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. During this time, he learned about business accounting and real-world applications of business, finding that he "kind of loved that too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## A Pivotal Transfer to Electrical Engineering
After realizing that engineering offered a viable career path for math and science enthusiasts, Jacobs approached the dean at Cornell to request a transfer from hotel management to electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The dean was reportedly surprised, asking if he meant the other way around, but Jacobs insisted he wanted to "do the hard stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Despite initial suspicion, the dean allowed the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Academic Excellence and Mentorship
Jacobs excelled in his new field. He went on to earn a PhD from MIT in just three years, completing it in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Crucially, he studied under Claude Shannon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, the "father of information theory," who had returned to MIT as a professor after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This mentorship was pivotal, as it is considered "extremely unlikely that Irwin Jacobs becomes the Irwin Jacobs he went on to be" without studying under Shannon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Professorship and Pioneering Digital Communications
Recognizing his talent, Shannon and MIT immediately asked Jacobs to stay on as a professor after he finished his PhD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He spent five years teaching at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, during which he taught what is believed to be the world's first course on digital communications to four students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This course applied Shannon's theories to practical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. He also co-authored the first textbook on digital communications, which remains "the Bible of digital communication Theory" and is still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Transition to California and Linkabit
In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) in California, working on the U.S. Space Program and satellite communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. There, he met Andrea "Andy" Veterbi, another MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate, and they became fast friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

After his sabbatical, Jacobs was offered an opportunity to start the electrical engineering department at the new UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. He accepted, moving his family to San Diego and inviting Veterbi to join him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. While teaching, he continued contracting work with defense contractors and JPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

This consulting work eventually led Jacobs, Veterbi, and UCLA professor Len Kleinrock to form a "shell company" in 1968 to manage their growing consulting engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. They humorously named it Linkabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Kleinrock later left to become a "founding father of the internet" by founding the ARPANET project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, but Jacobs and Veterbi continued Linkabit.

Jacobs recognized the business potential of Linkabit beyond mere consulting. In 1971, he took a sabbatical from UCSD to organize the company, and never returned to academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Linkabit transitioned from sub-consulting to bidding on prime contracts, realizing the greater financial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. They moved into the commercial sphere, leveraging their expertise in satellite communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Their first commercial project was designing the satellite communication system for Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, an early illustration of Walmart's technological innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

Linkabit's work, particularly in satellite communications, required highly efficient use of narrow bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. They utilized "spread spectrum technology" patented during World War II by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Jacobs found immense enjoyment in this business-side of his work, bringing in other professors and grad students to build a formidable team in information theory and wireless signals for defense contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, began his journey in the tech world with a focus on early computing and software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. His early career provided him with experiences that would later influence the creation of one of the internet's most iconic companies.

## Early Ventures and Career
Omidyar's professional life began with a company called Inc., a pen computing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. [[the_role_of_benchmark_and_its_partners_in_ebays_success | Bruce Dunleavy]] from Merrill Pickard Anderson and Air was an investor in Inc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The pen computing space, with the exception of Palm Pilot, largely failed to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Despite this, Inc.'s venture capitalists and management team refused to give up, pivoting the company into early e-commerce software enablement for enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Inc. was eventually sold to Microsoft, resulting in a positive outcome for all involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Omidyar worked at Inc. as an engineer during this period and developed a relationship with Bruce Dunleavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

After Inc., Omidyar moved to General Magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, a company recognized for inventing concepts like cloud computing and mobile technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. His background in pen computing made his move to General Magic a logical step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Founding of eBay (AuctionWeb)
While working full-time as an engineer at General Magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, Pierre Omidyar began tinkering with the early internet in his free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This led him to create a collection of internet services he called "eBay," short for "electronic Bay Area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The initial eBay website was a basic, courier-font site featuring various content and programmatic elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Among its five or so main features was a link to "AuctionWeb," which would later become the core of eBay's business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. At this stage, eBay was merely a side project for Omidyar, an engineer not considered "CEO material" by venture capitalists at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This contrasted sharply with the structured business plan and venture capital approach of [[Bezos and the foundation of Amazon | Jeff Bezos]] and [[Amazons early history and founding | Amazon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Early Monetization and Growth
Initially, Omidyar hosted auctions on eBay for free, with no business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, as traffic surged, his server costs became prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Reluctantly, he asked users to pay a small listing fee to cover expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Famously, users responded by mailing checks to his apartment, deluging him with more mail than he could open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This overwhelming response demonstrated clear product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

To manage the influx of payments, Omidyar brought on Jeff Skoll, a newly minted MBA from Stanford Business School, as the "business guy" to open and cash the checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. If not for the necessity of covering server costs, eBay might have remained a non-profit resource like the Linux Foundation or Wikipedia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Instead, it evolved into a highly profitable company, growing 10% month-over-month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Seeking Investment and the Benchmark Deal
Recognizing the potential to build eBay as a full-fledged business, Omidyar and Skoll decided to seek venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Omidyar, drawing from his experiences at Inc. and General Magic, understood the value of professional board members and VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He remembered Bruce Dunleavy from his Inc. days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

They pitched eBay to numerous firms on Sand Hill Road, but almost everyone turned them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. [[benchmarks_investment_in_ebay | Benchmark]] showed interest, with Bruce Dunleavy, Bob Kagle, and David Beirne leading the charge, recognizing the consumer psychology and management talent needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Benchmark offered Omidyar and Skoll a Series A financing term sheet of $6.7 million at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. At the same time, they had a competing offer from Knight Ridder, a large newspaper conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This was an acquisition offer for $50 million, a substantial sum for a two-person company barely structured as a formal business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Jeff Skoll had even briefly worked for Knight Ridder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

There is debate about the exact structure of Benchmark's investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. While eBay remained profitable and likely didn't use the company's portion of the $6.7 million investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, [[benchmarks_investment_in_ebay | Benchmark]] acquired 20% or more of eBay's equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Reports from The Washington Post and SEC filings indicated that [[benchmarks_investment_in_ebay | Benchmark]] also structured equity-backed loans of $750,000 each to Omidyar and Skoll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This effectively served as a secondary transaction, providing the founders with immediate capital and an incentive not to take the $50 million acquisition offer from Knight Ridder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This type of secondary transaction was highly untraditional and non-consensus at the time, with [[benchmarks_investment_in_ebay | Benchmark]] being the only VC willing to structure such a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Post-Investment Success
The deal closed in the summer of 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Just over a year later, in September 1998, eBay went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. By this time, [[the_role_of_benchmark_and_its_partners_in_ebays_success | Benchmark]] and David Beirne had been instrumental in recruiting Meg Whitman from Hasbro (and previously Disney) to take over as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. At the IPO, [[benchmarks_investment_in_ebay | Benchmark's]] $6.7 million investment was valued at $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. By the time their six-month lockup expired in the spring of 1999, the stake was worth over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This represented an incredible return, turning a $6.7 million investment into $4 billion in less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

Arthur Andersen was a prominent "Big Five" accounting firm that served as Enron's auditors. Their involvement with Enron, particularly due to significant conflicts of interest and later, obstruction of justice, played a critical role in the [[enron_financial_scandal | Enron financial scandal]] and ultimately led to Arthur Andersen's own demise. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>

## Early Involvement and Conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>

Initially, Arthur Andersen made appropriate recommendations, such as advising Ken Lay to fire two traders who were embezzling money from Enron in the late 1980s. However, Lay disregarded this advice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>

As Enron grew, a significant conflict of interest arose for Arthur Andersen. Pre-[[Impact of SarbanesOxley Act | Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], accounting firms often housed both audit and consulting arms under the same roof, as Andersen did with Andersen Consulting (which later became Accenture). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a> Enron became Arthur Andersen's largest client globally, generating $50 million annually, with half from audit and tax fees and half from consulting fees. This created a strong incentive for Andersen to keep Enron happy and avoid challenging their questionable accounting practices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>

## Enron's Accounting and Andersen's Complicity

Arthur Andersen played a part in introducing Enron to the concept of special purpose entities (SPEs) as a way to remove investments from Enron's books. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a> When Enron's new CEO, Jeff Skilling, insisted on using Mark-to-Market accounting — a method typically used by financial firms, not operating companies like Enron — Andersen was initially hesitant. They expressed discomfort unless the SEC formally approved it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a> Skilling, through his persuasive arguments, managed to convince the SEC to sign off on this, effectively bypassing Andersen's initial caution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>

Andersen also advised Andrew Fastow, Enron's CFO, to seek board approval for his self-dealing private equity funds (LJM funds), acknowledging the obvious conflict of interest. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:33">[01:18:33]</a>

## The Downfall and Document Destruction

As concerns about Enron's finances mounted in late 2001, Arthur Andersen grew "real nervous" about their role. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:16">[02:14:16]</a> On October 12, 2001, just days before Enron announced massive losses and restatements, Andersen's legal team sent an email to its Houston office. This email instructed them to destroy "non-finalized documents" related to Enron, both digital and physical, under the guise of the firm's "document retention policy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:47">[02:14:47]</a>

For weeks, the Houston office engaged in a massive shredding operation, destroying tens of thousands of emails and approximately one ton of paper daily, totaling dozens of tons of documents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:35">[02:15:35]</a>

During this period, Andersen also discovered critical accounting improprieties related to one of Enron's special purpose entities, "Chuko" (short for Chewbacca). It was found that the "independent" investor in this entity was the domestic partner of an Enron finance employee, rendering the entity not truly independent. This discovery led to a demand for Enron to restate years of financial results, reconsolidating billions in assets and liabilities back onto Enron's balance sheet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:34">[02:25:34]</a>

## Legacy and Demise

The public revelation of Arthur Andersen's widespread document destruction and complicity in Enron's accounting issues had devastating consequences for the firm. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:10">[02:16:10]</a> The Department of Justice initiated a criminal investigation against Arthur Andersen for obstruction of justice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:03">[02:17:03]</a>

Although it was later found that Andersen's internal policies were within legal bounds and the conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2005, the damage was irreversible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:48">[02:16:48]</a> The SEC revoked Andersen's CPA license in 2002, effectively barring them from operating as a public accounting firm. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:12">[02:17:12]</a> This, combined with their role as auditor for other scandal-ridden companies like WorldCom, led to clients abandoning the firm en masse. Arthur Andersen, once the world's most reputable accounting firm with 85,000 employees, ceased to exist. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:36">[02:17:36]</a>

The [[Impact of SarbanesOxley Act | Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002, largely enacted in response to the Enron scandal, directly addressed many of the accounting and corporate governance failures highlighted by Andersen's actions. It mandated stricter auditor independence by requiring accounting firms to spin off their consulting practices, preventing the kind of conflict of interest that plagued Andersen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:19">[02:39:19]</a>

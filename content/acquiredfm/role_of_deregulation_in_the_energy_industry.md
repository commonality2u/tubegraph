Deregulation played a pivotal role in transforming the energy industry, particularly in the natural gas sector, paving the way for new market structures and financial innovations.

## Early Stages of Deregulation
The concept of deregulation began to gain traction in the mid-1970s within the U.S. government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Ken Lay's former economics advisor from the University of Missouri was nominated to the Federal Power Commission at this time, right as discussions about deregulation were starting to percolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Lay himself served as the Deputy Under Secretary of Energy in the Department of the Interior during this period, when oil shocks were occurring and deregulation was a significant topic of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

By 1982, deregulation was actively permeating the industry, partly due to the Energy Act signed by President Carter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Creation of a Trading Market for Natural Gas
Prior to deregulation, the entire energy industry, including oil and natural gas, was heavily regulated by the government, which meant that any form of trading or [[financialization of energy]] largely did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Energy companies, such as pipeline operators, entered into long-term contracts with producers, and consumers would then purchase energy from these pipeline companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

However, as natural gas became sufficiently deregulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> and viewed as a "pseudo clean energy" and a promising frontier in the energy business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, opportunities arose. The push for natural gas was also influenced by a desire to reduce American dependence on foreign oil, a sentiment stemming from the 1970s oil embargoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

In 1982, facing falling energy prices and existing contracts to buy oil and gas at increasing prices, Ken Lay, then at Transco, proposed an innovative solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Leveraging his economics background and government experience, Lay conceived the idea of establishing a [[creation_of_a_trading_market_for_natural_gas | trading market]] for natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

His idea was for Transco to operate the pipelines but allow end consumers (like factories and utilities) to directly trade with producers through a spot market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This innovation created a real-time appropriate price for energy, allowing consumers to buy at today's market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This initiative was a massive success and established Lay as an industry legend, effectively "opening the floodgates" for new market dynamics in energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Lay was uniquely positioned to achieve this due to his decade of industry experience, economics training, and government background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

The deregulation and subsequent creation of this market transformed natural gas into a highly useful asset for free market enterprise, due to its natural properties allowing for easy pipelining, movement, and dense storage of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

Irwin Jacobs, a pivotal figure in the [[strategic_decisions_in_the_telecommunications_industry | wireless and Communications industry]], made significant contributions to satellite communications and various defense projects through his academic work and later with Linkabit [01:53:57].

## Early Academic and Research Endeavors

Born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1933 [00:00:03], Irwin Jacobs displayed a high aptitude for math and sciences [00:01:02]. Despite initial guidance counseling suggesting no future for math and science in his hometown [00:01:20], he pursued engineering, initially spending a year and a half at Cornell's hotel management school before transferring to electrical engineering [00:01:50]. This early business exposure later helped him transition from academia to entrepreneurship [00:02:14].

Jacobs went on to earn his PhD in electrical engineering from MIT in three years, finishing in 1959 [00:03:17]. He studied under Claude Shannon, the "father of information theory" [00:03:55], a connection deemed "extremely unlikely" to have occurred without Shannon's presence [00:03:59].

After his PhD, Jacobs became a professor at MIT, teaching the world's first course on digital communications to four students [00:04:36]. He also co-authored the first textbook on digital communications, which remains influential today [00:04:52].

In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical at JPL (Jet Propulsion Labs) to work on the [[cold_warera_aerospace_innovation_and_its_implications | U.S. Space Program]] and satellite communications [00:05:16]. It was here that he met Andrew Viterbi, another MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate [00:05:32].

## Founding of Linkabit and Defense Work

Jacobs and Viterbi became fast friends [00:05:50]. When Jacobs was offered the opportunity to start the electrical engineering department at the new UC San Diego, he invited Viterbi to join him [00:06:13]. While teaching, Jacobs continued his contracting work with [[innovation_in_defense_and_government_sectors | defense contractors]] and JPL [00:06:41].

Recognizing the challenges of balancing academic work with individual consulting, Jacobs, Viterbi, and a third professor, Len Kleinrock (a "core founding father of the internet" [00:09:15]), decided to form a "shell company" to manage their consulting work [00:07:32]. This company, founded around the early 1970s, was called Linkabit [00:07:55]. Kleinrock later left Linkabit to work on the ARPANET project, sending the first internet transmission ever [00:08:44].

Initially, Linkabit primarily worked on NASA and Navy defense projects in San Diego, focusing on satellite communications [00:09:27]. Their expertise centered on efficient use of narrow bandwidth for satellite communications, a problem that still persists in the "emerging space economy" [00:09:41]. This work involved utilizing "spread Spectrum technology" patented during the World War II era by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil [00:10:30].

Linkabit became an "Army of the greatest information Theory and wireless signal Minds in the country," almost exclusively focused on defense contracting and satellite work [00:11:18]. By 1971, Jacobs took a sabbatical from UCSD to organize Linkabit, eventually never returning to his academic post [00:11:40].

## Transition to Commercial Projects

Linkabit realized that prime [[innovation_in_defense_and_government_sectors | defense contractors]] like Raytheon, Lockheed, and Boeing were earning the bulk of the money, while Linkabit was doing the specialized engineering [00:12:16]. This prompted them to consider bidding on contracts themselves and moving into the commercial sphere [00:13:03].

Their first commercial project was designing the satellite communication system for Walmart [00:14:05], a "regional retailer" at the time [00:13:40]. Walmart was a highly innovative retailer that invested tens of millions of dollars in a private satellite relay system in the late 1970s and early 1980s [00:14:28]. This system was necessary because the internet's bandwidth was insufficient for their daily store data tabulation and Sam Walton's broadcasts to local stores [00:14:35]. This involvement with [[connection_to_walmarts_satellite_network | Walmart's satellite network]] marked a significant diversification for Linkabit.

Jacobs's journey, from an unexpected start in hotel management to pioneering digital communications and leading Linkabit's crucial work in defense and satellite systems, laid the groundwork for future ventures like [[qualcomms_technological_innovations_and_patents | Qualcomm]].

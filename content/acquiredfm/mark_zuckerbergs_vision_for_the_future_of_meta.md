[[Mark Zuckerbergs personal and leadership philosophies | Mark Zuckerberg]] views [[History of Meta and Facebook | Meta]] not merely as a social media company, but as a "social connection company" focused on building the future of human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This core identity drives [[Metas strategies and future outlook | Meta's strategies]] for the next decades, aiming to enable people to feel present with others regardless of physical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## The Next Computing Platform: Glasses and Holograms

[[Mark Zuckerbergs vision for the future of Meta | Mark Zuckerberg's vision]] sees future social experiences moving beyond the constraints of phone screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The ideal platform, in his view, will be glasses that integrate digital and physical worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. These glasses would:
*   See and hear what the user does, acting as a perfect [[Metas approach to technology and innovation | AI assistant]] with context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   Project holograms into the real world, enabling social interactions that are not confined to a small screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   Deliver a realistic sense of presence and physical perception, allowing users to engage with others as if they are physically there, even if they are a hologram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Developing these glasses involves solving significant challenges, including building novel display technology, miniaturizing components like chips, microphones, speakers, cameras, and eye-tracking, and fitting all of this into a good-looking, all-day wearable form factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This is a "huge project" that [[Metas strategies and future outlook | Meta]] has been working on for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Role of AI

The emergence of [[Metas approach to technology and innovation | AI]], particularly large language models (LLMs), has significantly impacted [[Mark Zuckerbergs vision for the future of Meta | Meta's]] strategy. Though early versions of [[Metaverse and its implications for companies like Meta | Ray-Ban Meta glasses]] shipped before the public awareness of LLMs, [[Metas approach to technology and innovation | AI]] has quickly become their primary feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Zuckerberg believes [[Metas approach to technology and innovation | AI]] will be the ultimate incarnation of the glasses, allowing for conversations where some participants are physically present, others are holograms, and some are even [[Metas approach to technology and innovation | AI]]s embodied as individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## The Strategic Importance of Owning Platforms

[[The strategic importance of owning platforms at Meta | Mark Zuckerberg]] emphasizes the strategic importance of owning the underlying computing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Having experienced limitations when building on others' mobile platforms—where platforms could dictate what could or couldn't be built or how ad businesses could operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>—[[The strategic importance of owning platforms at Meta | Meta]] aims to build its own core technology platforms for AR glasses, mixed reality, and [[Metas approach to technology and innovation | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. This drive for self-reliance is also financially motivated; [[The strategic importance of owning platforms at Meta | Zuckerberg]] estimates [[History of Meta and Facebook | Meta]] could be twice as profitable if it owned its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>.

## Open vs. Closed Ecosystems

A key ideological battle for the future, in Zuckerberg's view, is between open and closed platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. While companies like Apple pursue a closed, integrated model, [[Mark Zuckerbergs vision for the future of Meta | Meta]] aims to build the next generation of open platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. This approach fosters a more vibrant tech industry by allowing individual developers to build innovative products without needing explicit permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>.

## From "Good" to "Awesome"

[[Mark Zuckerbergs personal and leadership philosophies | Zuckerberg's]] personal philosophy has shifted towards building "awesome" things in addition to "good" ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. While [[History of Meta and Facebook | Meta's]] current social media products are "good"—used by over 3.3 billion people daily because they are useful and help connection, business, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>—"awesome" is defined as uplifting and inspiring, leading to greater optimism about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. He aims for [[Metas strategies and future outlook | Meta's]] next stage (the next 15 years) to focus on creating more "awesome" products, particularly within [[Metaverse and its implications for companies like Meta | Reality Labs]] and [[Metas approach to technology and innovation | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.

## Long-Term Commitment

[[Mark Zuckerbergs personal and leadership philosophies | Zuckerberg]] possesses a long-term perspective on [[Metas strategies and future outlook | Meta's]] journey. He considers past challenges like the post-IPO mobile transition a "painful year and a half" but ultimately "not that bad" in the grand scheme of things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:04">[04:10:04]</a>. He views the political miscalculation post-2016 as a "20-year mistake" that will take another decade to fully resolve, but expresses confidence [[Metas strategies and future outlook | Meta]] will emerge stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>. This long-term commitment is enabled by his unique governance structure, which allows him to prioritize long-term vision over short-term market pressures, an approach he adopted after the 2006 Yahoo acquisition attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. He believes this "pain tolerance" is crucial for navigating difficult periods and making the right strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

## Culture of Iteration and Learning

A fundamental aspect of [[Mark Zuckerbergs vision for the future of Meta | Meta's]] DNA and [[Metas strategies and future outlook | strategy]] is its strong technology foundation and a culture of rapid iteration and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. [[Mark Zuckerbergs personal and leadership philosophies | Zuckerberg]] believes that defining strategy as "learning faster than every other company" leads to building better products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. This involves:
*   Shipping products early, even if "almost at the line of being embarrassed," to get feedback quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   Not waiting for universal praise, as that delays learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.
*   Embracing a mix of inventing new patterns (like News Feed) and learning from successful patterns discovered by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
*   Acknowledging that more smart people exist outside the company than inside, making market learning crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

This approach is reflected in [[Metas approach to technology and innovation | Meta's]] significant use of open source technology, which allows for community building and standardization, leading to cost savings and quality improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

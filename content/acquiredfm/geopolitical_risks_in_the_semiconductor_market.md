The [[semiconductor industry dynamics | semiconductor industry]] faces significant geopolitical risks, particularly concerning the pivotal role of [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]] and its location in Taiwan. These risks are a major concern for investors and global economies alike. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>

## TSMC's Central Role and Geopolitical Challenges
[[TSMC]] is considered one of the top five most important technology platforms globally, with its importance arguably surpassing even that of major consumer electronics companies like Apple. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a> If [[TSMC]]'s fabs were to shut down, for instance, due to geopolitical conflict or if China were to seize Taiwan, the Western world could face a setback of five to ten years in technological progress. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a> This would have a profound impact, as technology progress currently drives a significant portion of global GDP. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>

The potential for such an event is frequently discussed, with analysts even raising questions about Taiwan's sovereignty on [[TSMC]]'s earnings calls. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a> While the auto sector has already experienced chip shortages, a disruption at [[TSMC]] would dwarf those issues, causing extremely painful impacts on the global economy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>

## The Semiconductor Ecosystem as a "Super Organism"
The [[semiconductor industry dynamics | semiconductor industry]] is viewed as a "super organism" composed of a handful of critical companies, including [[TSMC]], ASML, Lam Research, Applied Materials (AMAT), and KLA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a> These entities are interdependent; for example, ASML would not be valuable without [[TSMC]] and Samsung. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>

If this super organism were to be disrupted, recreating it elsewhere would take a long time, even with access to the necessary Western technologies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a> This inherent interconnectedness highlights the vulnerability of the global technology supply chain to localized geopolitical events.

## Government Involvement and "Semiconductor Sovereignty"
The extreme importance of the [[semiconductor industry dynamics | semiconductor industry]] has led to increased government involvement. The concept of "semiconductor sovereignty" refers to efforts by nations to reduce their reliance on foreign chip manufacturing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>

For instance, [[TSMC]] is building a 5-nanometer fab in Arizona, and it is plausible that more fabs will be built in Europe as well. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a> Historically, when technology reaches a stable state, the industry tends to optimize for efficiency, leading to horizontal models like the foundry model pioneered by [[TSMC]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a> However, during periods of technological change, vertical integration becomes more desirable, as seen with Tesla's approach to electric vehicles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:11">[01:24:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:20">[01:24:20]</a>

The Taiwanese government's initial 50% ownership of [[TSMC]], which is believed to still be around 20%, underscores its status as a national champion, making any acquisition by another company virtually impossible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:19">[01:46:19]</a>

## Investment Implications
Given the high stakes, investors consider the geopolitical risks when evaluating companies like [[TSMC]]. While it is a "resilient" position for some investors due to its strong fundamentals and role in driving trillions of dollars in market cap for its partners, the geopolitical risk prevents it from being a 10% portfolio position. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:20">[01:48:20]</a> The assumption is that if a conflict arises concerning Taiwan and [[TSMC]], the entire U.S. market would be affected, leading to broader global instability where investment performance is no longer the primary concern. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>

Some investors actively avoid positions in China tech companies due to concerns about ownership structures and potential delistings, viewing the situation as "sketchy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>

Ultimately, the [[technological_and_geopolitical_issues_facing_tsmc_and_the_semiconductor_industry | technological and geopolitical issues facing TSMC and the semiconductor industry]] highlight the complex and interdependent nature of global supply chains and the profound economic consequences of potential disruptions.

Peloton, a company that pioneered the connected fitness category, was founded in 2012 by John Foley, with ideation beginning in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>. The company's narrative is deeply intertwined with the rise of boutique fitness, particularly SoulCycle and Flywheel, which were highly popular in New York where Foley and his wife Jill lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>.

## Founding Vision and Early Challenges
Foley's idea for Peloton stemmed from the difficulty of scheduling and accessing popular in-person spin classes with top instructors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>. His vision was to create an infinitely scalable version of these classes, accessible anywhere and at any time, democratizing location, elastically scaling access to the best instructors, and enabling time-shifting for workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:25:00">[30:25:00]</a>. This aligned with the principle of "everything linear dies, everything on demand wins," a concept later articulated by [[Barry McCarthys role as Peloton CEO | Barry McCarthy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:00">[31:27:00]</a>.

Initially, Peloton aimed to build a high-quality bike and elegant software, but they didn't want to produce their own content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:20:00">[34:20:00]</a>. They sought partnerships with existing studios like SoulCycle or Flywheel for content access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a>. While SoulCycle largely ignored them, Peloton reached a term sheet with Flywheel for content and go-to-market partnership, but Flywheel ultimately pulled out, forcing Peloton into a vertically integrated strategy to produce its own content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:00">[35:09:00]</a>.

John Foley's background included serving as head of Barnes & Noble's Nook e-reader business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:11:00">[33:11:00]</a>, where he likely learned the importance of content over hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>. Prior to that, he worked at Interactive Corp (IAC) under Barry Diller, with involvement in Citysearch and Pronto.com, demonstrating his experience in tech and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>. He also successfully rehabbed the Evite team post-dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>.

Despite Foley's background and the compelling vision, it was incredibly difficult to secure funding for Peloton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>. All venture capitalists initially passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:42:00">[38:42:00]</a>. Foley eventually raised $400,000 from friends and family at a $2 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>. A subsequent $3.5 million round was also raised from individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>.

In 2013, Peloton launched a Kickstarter campaign, raising $307,332 against a goal of $250,000, but half of the backers were already investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a>. This suggested that while the product was revolutionary, its "awesomeness" was hard to communicate without direct experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>.

## Pricing and Customer Acquisition
Peloton initially priced its bike at $1,200, intending to sell hardware at cost or a loss like video game consoles, and make money on subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:54:00">[44:54:00]</a>. However, it wasn't selling well, as customers perceived the hardware quality to be low at that price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:25:00">[45:25:00]</a>. Through customer feedback, Peloton realized that by raising the price to $2,245, they signaled it as a "jewel premium expensive aspirational luxury product," which boosted sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:29:00">[45:29:00]</a>. This strategy also ensured they attracted affluent customers with low price sensitivity, leading to an incredibly sticky business with annual churn as low as 7-9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:29:00">[46:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:28:00">[47:28:00]</a>.

Customer acquisition was also challenging. Rather than relying solely on online sales, Peloton opened physical stores in malls, starting with Short Hills Mall in New Jersey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>. This contrarian strategy was crucial because experiencing the bike firsthand was necessary to understand its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>.

## Growth and Financial Milestones
In 2015, Peloton generated $60 million in revenue, which grew to $170 million in 2016, and $325 million in 2017 at a $1.3 billion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:54:00">[49:54:00]</a>. Silicon Valley started to take notice, despite having passed on earlier funding rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>.

Peloton's first institutional funding round, a $10 million Series B at a $35 million post-money valuation, was led by Tiger Global in late 2014, with Tiger investing $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:08:00">[48:08:00]</a>. Tiger Global later became the largest shareholder at IPO, owning almost 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:55:00">[48:55:00]</a>.

In 2018, Peloton introduced the Tread treadmill and the digital app subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:18:00">[50:18:00]</a>. The digital app, priced at $12.99 a month, proved to be a "surprisingly full-featured" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:32:00">[51:32:00]</a>.

Before its IPO, Peloton faced a lawsuit in early 2019 from the National Music Publishers Association for $150 million (later $300 million) over improper sync licenses for music used in their classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:13:00">[53:13:00]</a>. This issue highlighted the significant portion of subscription revenue (around one-third) that goes to music licensing due to the need for multiple license types, unlike music streaming services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:03:00">[54:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>.

Peloton went public in September 2019, after settling the music lawsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, revenue was $915 million, up over 100% from the previous year, with subscription revenue at $181 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. The IPO priced at an $8 billion valuation, but shares traded down 11% on opening to $7.2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. Hardware gross margins were about 40%, and while acquisition costs were high (around $521 per gross subscriber), the long-term value from subscriptions (potentially $2,340 in revenue over five years) made it a profitable model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37:00">[01:05:37:00]</a>. Peloton also paid Affirm roughly $150 million a year to offer 0% financing, indicating their push to expand down-market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.

In Holiday 2019, Peloton's "Peloton Wife" commercial garnered significant pop culture attention, which ultimately proved to be good marketing despite initial controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

## [[Impact of the pandemic on Peloton | Impact of the pandemic on Peloton]] and Recent [[Challenges faced by Peloton | Challenges]]
The COVID-19 pandemic, starting in early 2020, significantly boosted Peloton's product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. In just 45 days, digital subscribers increased tenfold from 100,000 to 1.2 million due to a three-month free trial offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. Subscribers grew by roughly a million in the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. Revenue soared to $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2020 and $4 billion in fiscal year 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>. The stock price peaked at over $150 per share, reaching a $49 billion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.

However, Peloton's strong growth during the pandemic was followed by significant [[Challenges faced by Peloton | challenges]]. By September 2020, there was a four-month backlog for bikes due to reliance on international shipping and external supply chain partners, as Peloton did not manufacture its own bikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.

Despite immense demand, Peloton introduced the Bike+ in September 2020 at $2,495, while lowering the original bike's price to $1,895 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. The Bike+ itself had product issues, including a lower DPI screen and features that were not appealing to all users, leading to customer service issues and high logistics costs for returns and repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

In December 2020, Peloton acquired Precor for $420 million in cash, primarily for its manufacturing prowess and commercial distribution channels to hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. In spring 2021, Peloton announced plans for the $400 million Peloton Output Park in Ohio for in-house manufacturing, another significant cash outlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:24">[01:31:24]</a>.

Tragically, in spring 2021, the Tread treadmill faced a recall due to accidents, leading to a 15% stock drop and a mishandled initial response from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:47">[01:31:47]</a>. In November 2021, Peloton missed earnings and cut its outlook, causing the stock to drop 32% in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:17">[01:32:17]</a>. This period also saw negative media attention, such as Mr. Big's death on a Peloton in "Sex and the City" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>.

By January 20, 2022, news broke that Peloton was stopping production of new hardware due to an inventory glut of $1.3 billion, as demand had completely dried up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>. This contradicted prior management assertions that demand would continue to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. Revenue growth slowed to 9% in Q4 and 5% in Q1 fiscal year 2022, with full-year revenue guidance cut to $3.7-$3.8 billion, a sequential decline from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>. Employee count also ballooned from 4,000 in January 2021 to 9,000 before recent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:34">[01:36:34]</a>.

## Leadership Change and Future Outlook
On February 8, 2022, Peloton announced its earnings, cut guidance, pulled the plug on the Ohio manufacturing facility, and laid off 2,800 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. Most significantly, John Foley stepped down as CEO and became executive chairman, with [[Barry McCarthys role as Peloton CEO | Barry McCarthy]] appointed as the new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. McCarthy's first day was February 9, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

Despite Foley's shift to executive chairman, he retains significant control due to Peloton's dual-class stock structure, holding 39.6% of voting power, with co-founders owning another 18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:44">[01:39:44]</a>. However, [[Barry McCarthys role as Peloton CEO | Barry McCarthy]]'s memo to staff emphasized confronting reality, driving growth, and taking risks, suggesting he has autonomy to make necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:49">[01:40:49]</a>.

## Current State and Outlook
Peloton retains an "insane level of customer love," with an NPS around 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:05">[01:45:05]</a>. Its subscriber base grew from 700,000 pre-pandemic to nearly 3 million, and it remains the largest player in the connected fitness category it pioneered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>. Network effects exist through friends having Pelotons, and its low churn rates are remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>. [[Pelotons business model and competitive strategy | Peloton's business model and competitive strategy]] also benefits from significant scale economies, allowing investment in top instructors and content, creating a virtuous flywheel that attracts and retains talent from competitors like SoulCycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:09">[02:01:09]</a>.

[[Challenges faced by Peloton | Bear cases for Peloton]] include slowing growth (9% in Q4, 5% in Q1), revised-down subscriber targets (around 3 million by year-end vs. 3.5 million previously), and a $1.3 billion inventory glut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:38">[01:53:38]</a>. There's also a broader trend of consumer hardware companies struggling to remain standalone entities (e.g., Fitbit, GoPro, Jawbone, Flip Video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>. While the product itself is high quality, the company's past management decisions, particularly regarding product strategy, pricing, and forecasting demand, have been criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:01">[02:08:01]</a>. The company was also deeply unprofitable and still raising capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:48">[02:09:48]</a>.

Despite these challenges, the appointment of [[Barry McCarthys role as Peloton CEO | Barry McCarthy]] as CEO, given his track record at Netflix and Spotify, is seen as a positive sign that financial and operational issues can be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:25">[01:51:25]</a>. The market reacted positively, with Peloton's stock rising 25% on the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a>. The long-term "A+" scenario for Peloton involves remaining an independent, profitable company that can meaningfully expand its demand into new concentric circles beyond its current affluent and aspirational customer base, potentially through its digital app which is accessible to a much broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:57">[02:15:57]</a>.

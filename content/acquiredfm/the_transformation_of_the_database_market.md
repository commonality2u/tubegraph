A core theme over the last decade has been the view that "not all software is created equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This perspective extends to the evolution and eventual remaking of the database market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Databases in 2000

Around the year 2000, databases constituted the largest sector of software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The aggregate total enterprise value of companies primarily deriving their revenue from databases was approximately one trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Vision of Data-Driven Decisions

Looking forward from that point, it became clear that humanity would continually produce more data annually than in all preceding years combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, necessitating a "home" for this expanding volume of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Bill Gates once articulated a vision in response to a question from Meg Whitman about whether "all the interesting stuff" was done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Gates responded by highlighting the "barbaric" way decisions were made at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He envisioned a future where vast amounts of data would be stored, and machines would analyze this data to facilitate better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This future included applications such as:

*   Diagnosing illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Educating dyslexic children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Maintaining aircraft engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

These decisions would ultimately be made by machines interpreting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Remaking the Database Market in the Cloud

This vision underscored a strong belief that the entire database market was destined to be remade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This transformation was expected to occur "in the cloud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, with new solutions purpose-built for cloud environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### The Infrastructure Layer

A key focus of this transformation involved the infrastructure layer within the cloud, and all the necessary enablement to facilitate enterprises' migration to the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This focus proved to be a "rich vein" for development and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

The podcast *Acquired* hosted a live show at the [[acquireds_chase_center_event_details | Chase Center]], marking a significant physical instantiation of the brand [00:03:26]. The event showcased the deep partnership between *Acquired* and [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | JP Morgan Payments]], bringing together thousands of listeners for a memorable experience [00:02:22].

## Conception and Partnership

The idea for [[acquireds_chase_center_event_details | Acquired Live at Chase Center]] originated during a call with the [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | JP Morgan team]] [00:00:21]. Initially, [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | JP Morgan]] mentioned having a small event in a corner of the [[acquireds_chase_center_event_details | Chase Center]] [00:00:30]. This sparked the idea for a larger, dedicated [[acquireds_chase_center_event_details | Acquired Live]] event within the venue [00:00:33]. The [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | JP Morgan Payments team]] developed the "crazy proposal" to make it happen [00:00:38].

The podcast's growth played a role in enabling such a large-scale event, particularly following a *Wall Street Journal* article in May 2024 that led to a quarter-million new subscribers and quadrupled listening hours [00:01:29]. The [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | collaboration with JP Morgan]] was deemed essential, as they deeply understand the show's essence and their ideas fit seamlessly [00:01:49]. The event was described as something that "had to be [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | JP Morgan Payments]] and Acquired in order for it to happen at all" [00:08:06].

## [[event_planning_and_production_for_acquired_live | Event Planning and Production]]

The period leading up to the event was described as a "mad dash to create an amazing experience for every single one of the thousands of people that are there" [00:02:17]. Key decisions included the content of a Jensen video, an Hermes call, and whether to walk on stage with Perkins [00:02:24].

### Artistic Design

The [[event_planning_and_production_for_acquired_live | event's design]] was significantly influenced by artist Don [00:02:44]. The [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | collaboration with JP Morgan Payments]] for the artistic elements was "really special," encompassing everything from posters to stage art [00:02:53]. Don, who had worked on hundreds of album packages and concert posters, was amazed to see the entire [[acquireds_chase_center_event_details | stadium lit up]] with his work [00:03:11]. The design aimed to be "big and grandiose and bright," featuring a silhouette of Ben and David as the central image [00:03:47]. This artistic direction allowed the audience to "live inside the Acquired brand" physically [00:03:21].

### [[presale_and_ticketing_information_for_acquired_live | Ticket Sales]] and Guests

[[presale_and_ticketing_information_for_acquired_live | Ticket sales]] were robust, with only around 300 tickets remaining shortly before the event [00:04:00]. Notable guests and speakers confirmed for the event included Emily Chang, Daniel X, and Mike Taylor [00:04:20]. Mike Taylor, a major recording artist with hundreds of millions of listens on Spotify, performed the Acquired theme song live [00:04:49].

## The Live Event Experience

The hosts, Ben and David, maintained a tradition of going for a run together, which became a shared experience with over 100 listeners before the show [00:05:25]. This pre-show run helped them "work our nerves out a little bit" [00:05:39].

The show itself was designed to be a "spectacle," transcending typical podcast events [00:05:08]. The highlight was an [[insights_from_conversation_with_mark_zuckerberg_at_acquired_live | electric conversation with Mark Zuckerberg]], where he "threw away the playbook from like the first word out of his mouth" [00:06:37]. Zuckerberg's admission of a "20-year mistake" regarding a "political miscalculation" during his time at Facebook/Meta was particularly impactful, causing jaws to drop throughout the arena [00:07:22].

The event concluded with immense gratitude for the [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | partnership with JP Morgan Payments]], recognized as the only entity capable of making such an event possible [00:08:04].

## Future Outlook

Despite the success, the hosts expressed a humorous mix of desires: "let's go big" and "never again," especially with young families [00:08:48]. There was also a humorous moment when the hosts mentioned Jamie Dimon, CEO of [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_for_acquired_live | JP Morgan Chase]], prompting audience murmurs of anticipation [00:08:56]. While no concrete plans were announced, the year 2025 was mentioned [00:09:13].

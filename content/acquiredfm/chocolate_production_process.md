The [[Varieties of MMs | candy industry]] in America initially consisted of unbranded "Penny Candy" made from sugar-based sweets, sold wholesale by local bakers to retailers and drugstores [07:24]. At this time, chocolate was not yet a significant product in the U.S. [07:14].

## Early Chocolate in America

Milton Hershey began selling his Hershey's chocolate bars in Pennsylvania in 1900 [09:40]. These early bars were simple five-cent slabs of plain chocolate, without additions like almonds or chocolate kisses [09:56]. Hershey had not yet perfected the scaling of chocolate production, keeping it regional and not widely popular across the country, especially not in Minneapolis [10:07].

## The Discovery of Solid Chocolate
The concept of solid chocolate bars was relatively new in the late 1800s, as most chocolate prior to that was consumed as a drink [15:47]. Milton Hershey encountered solid chocolate at the Colombian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 [14:51]. Impressed by its "rich complexity" and "deliciousness," he purchased all the chocolate-making equipment on display from a German company and had it shipped to his facility in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, intending to establish a chocolate-making operation [15:11].

Chocolate is described as a "very rich, very complex food" with a history dating back to Montezuma and the Aztecs, and even further back to Ecuador around 5,300 years ago [16:04].

## The Process of Making Chocolate

The detailed process of chocolate production begins with the cocoa fruit, which grows on trees, originally in South America and now commonly in Africa [17:48].

1.  **Harvesting and Initial Processing** [17:57]
    *   The football-shaped cocoa pod is picked and cut open to reveal the seeds or "beans" [17:59].
    *   The fruit surrounding the seeds is sweet but does not taste like chocolate; the flavor comes from the seeds themselves [18:03].
    *   These beans are then fermented in wooden boxes, where yeast consumes the sugar to create alcohol, followed by acid eating the alcohol, which ultimately kills the bean [18:27].
    *   After fermentation, the beans are dried, either in drying beds, mechanical smoke dryers, or on banana leaves [18:36]. The drying method can significantly affect the flavor, particularly the acidity of the beans [18:56].
    *   Once dried, the beans are put into sacks and typically shipped to Europe, which was historically the primary region for chocolate manufacturing [19:11].

2.  **Factory Processing** [19:21]
    *   At the factory, the beans are sorted and sterilized [19:21].
    *   They are then roasted to develop their flavor [19:27].
    *   The shells are removed through a process called "winnowing," leaving behind the "nibs" [19:28].
    *   These nibs can be pressed to create two separate products: cocoa powder and cocoa butter, which chocolatiers might later recombine in various ratios [19:39].

3.  **Refinement and Finishing** [19:53]
    *   The nibs are ground down to the desired particle size [19:53].
    *   The mixture then undergoes "conching," a process where large cylinders spin around to smooth out particles [19:55]. This process was discovered by Rudolph Lindt in 1879, when he accidentally left cocoa in a roller grinder for three days, resulting in a silky, smooth texture [20:07]. Conching allows for the addition of more cocoa butter, contributing to the creamy texture of Swiss chocolate [20:29].
    *   After conching, the liquid chocolate is not yet shelf-stable and can "bloom" (develop a white, dull surface) if not properly treated [21:05].
    *   To prevent blooming and achieve a shiny, snappy finish, the chocolate undergoes "tempering" [21:22]. This complex chemical process involves heating the liquid chocolate to super-liquefy it, then cooling it to a precise temperature to form "seed crystals," and finally reheating it slightly to allow the remaining chocolate to form around these crystals, creating a uniform, stable structure [21:40].
    *   Sugar is typically added during the conching and tempering stages, as 100% dark chocolate is very bitter [23:35]. Other common additions include more cocoa butter, soy lecithin, and vanilla [24:07].

## The Advent of Milk Chocolate
Milk chocolate was a revolutionary invention, transforming chocolate from a bitter, barely enjoyable flavor to a smooth, creamy, and broadly appealing product [28:28]. Its invention significantly expanded the chocolate market [29:00].

### Nestle's Role
The story of milk chocolate is intertwined with Nestle. In 1866, Henri Nestle, based in Switzerland, was researching infant feeding solutions to combat high infant mortality rates [24:43]. He developed a method using an air pump at low temperatures to concentrate milk into a powder, which, combined with a proprietary cereal mix, became the first baby formula [25:23].

Daniel Peter, a neighbor and chocolatier whose baby rejected breast milk and needed Nestle's formula, conceived the idea of combining this dehydrated baby formula with cocoa and sugar to create a creamy drink [26:19]. The challenge was that milk is not a stable product and spoils quickly [26:47]. Peter initially struggled with grainy mixtures and spoilage when trying to dry milk himself [27:04].

He eventually found success by using condensed milk (a concentrated syrup rather than dried powder) and spreading the mixture on large trays to slowly dry into milk chocolate flakes [27:21]. This flaky product could then be turned into a drink, and later, especially by companies like Cadbury in Europe, into solid milk chocolate bars [27:51].

### Hershey's Milk Chocolate Formula
Milton Hershey learned about milk chocolate during his travels in Europe [29:20]. Despite not being a chemist, he experimented for years through "trial and error" to develop a method for producing milk chocolate at scale in his factory in Hershey, Pennsylvania [29:36]. His process, while successful, resulted in a slightly sour taste [30:18].

Two theories exist for this unique flavor:
1.  A scientist working with Hershey, Schabach, developed a method of slow evaporation of non-fat milk over low heat, creating a sweet, creamy concoction that blended well with cocoa without spoiling, resulting in a "slightly sour but distinctly original" American chocolate [31:05].
2.  Hershey acquired a large batch of European milk powder that had slightly soured during its transatlantic journey [31:43]. Reluctant to waste it, he used it to make chocolate and found it sold well [31:51]. Hershey Company officials have always denied this version [31:55].

Regardless, this unique, slightly sour flavor became the accepted taste for chocolate among Americans, solidifying Hershey's market position [32:31]. Being "first to market and setting the taste of a specific area" is crucial in the candy business [32:23].

## Frank Mars and Early Chocolate Bars
When Frank Mars returned to Minneapolis, he capitalized on the popularity of cream truffles, coating them in chocolate sourced from Hershey [39:50]. In 1922, he introduced his first combination bar, the "Maro Bar," which was not a success [40:43].

These "combination bars" or "count lines" differentiated themselves by adding cheaper ingredients like nuts or nougat to chocolate, allowing for lower costs and unique flavors [36:40]. Unlike previous chocolate which was measured by weight, these new bars were measured by count, hence the term "count lines" [41:12].

## Forest Mars and M&Ms
[[Varieties of MMs | M&M's]] are small, round pieces of chocolate coated with a hard candy shell to prevent melting in hand or in hot weather [19:50]. This coating process is called "hard panning" [19:50]. Forest Mars observed this "drag√©e" candy in Europe, where it was popular with soldiers during the Spanish Civil War, and conceived its potential for the American market [01:03:52, 01:49:17]. He realized its non-melting quality would be a significant advantage, especially for military rations [01:59:28].

M&M's were initially sold in tube packaging, similar to British Smarties [02:04:33]. The first M&M's were plain chocolate [00:06:00]. [[Varieties of MMs | Peanut M&M's]] were launched in 1954, initially only in tan, with yellow, red, and green added in 1960 [02:20:21]. Over time, the company has introduced many [[Varieties of MMs | varieties of M&M's]], such as dark chocolate, mint (seasonal), pretzel, almond, crunchy cookie (replacing crispy), dark chocolate peanut, fudge brownie, campfire s'mores, caramel cold brew, birthday cake, chili nut, and pumpkin spice latte [00:10:00]. The milk chocolate and peanut varieties remain the primary sales drivers [01:22:19].

Mars later acquired the [[Influence of Advertising and Marketing in Candy Industry | Kind Bar]] in 2020, a "healthy" snack bar that aligns with evolving consumer preferences for lower-sugar options [03:09:43, 03:10:21].

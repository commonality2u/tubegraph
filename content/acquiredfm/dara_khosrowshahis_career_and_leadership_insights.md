Dara Khosrowshahi, the current CEO of [[Uber]], has led the company through a significant transformation since his appointment in 2017. His career, spanning decades in technology and media, offers valuable insights into leadership, strategic decision-making, and navigating complex business environments.

## Early Career and Influences

Khosrowshahi began his professional journey as an analyst at Allen & Company, an investment bank specializing in media and entertainment [09:00]. This role proved pivotal, leading to his first encounter with influential figures.

### Meeting Barry Diller

While an analyst, Khosrowshahi was assigned to a deal involving Barry Diller, who was then running QVC [09:11]. Diller, previously CEO of Paramount and Fox Studios [09:23], sought to acquire Paramount Pictures in a hostile tender offer, a move described as "The Minnow swallowing the whale" [10:14]. During this intense bidding process, Khosrowshahi's direct involvement in preparing financial models led Diller to request to speak with him personally [11:24].

Khosrowshahi recalls feeling like he was "going to get fired" [11:42], but this experience revealed Diller's pattern of seeking the "unvarnished truth" by going directly to the source [12:24]. Khosrowshahi found Diller to be someone he immediately wanted to work for [12:39].

### Lessons from Mentors

*   **Bet on People, Not Companies**: Herb Allen, a key figure at Allen & Company, instilled in Khosrowshahi the philosophy of "betting on people and not hierarchies" [12:57]. This loyalty to individuals was mirrored by Diller, who was willing to "throw a young person off the deep end" [13:15].
*   **Don't Overplan Your Career**: Khosrowshahi advises young people not to "over plan their career" [15:28]. He emphasizes the importance of being open to opportunities and, when one arises, "going all in" rather than hedging [16:06]. His own career path exemplifies this, as he initially planned to stay at Allen & Company but found success by remaining open to new possibilities [15:57].
*   **"If there isn't travel, there's no life"**: This profound statement from Barry Diller during the 9/11 crisis shaped Khosrowshahi's understanding of resilience and long-term perspective [06:51].

## Leadership at Expedia (2004-2017)

Khosrowshahi served as CEO of Expedia for 13 years, from 2004 to 2017 [03:58]. His tenure began after IAC, led by Barry Diller, acquired a controlling interest in and later fully privatized Expedia [04:13].

### Navigating Crisis: The 9/11 Acquisition

A notable event in Expedia's history was its acquisition by IAC just before the September 11th attacks in 2001 [04:58]. Despite a "material adverse change" clause that allowed IAC to pull out of the deal in light of the severe impact on travel, Barry Diller chose to proceed [05:05]. Khosrowshahi recounts a pivotal meeting where Diller stated, "If there isn't travel, there's no life" [06:51]. This decision, based on a belief that "things revert to norm," provided stability for Expedia and proved to be a "genius decision" in hindsight [07:18].

### Lessons from Competition with Booking.com

Khosrowshahi learned significant lessons from Expedia's competition with Booking.com [19:26]. Booking.com was an "execution machine" with a clear focus on hotels, targeting the fragmented supply base and building a global business first [19:56]. Unlike Expedia, which focused on consumer demand and brand, Booking.com was "supply-led," using its expanding hotel inventory as a marketing engine [20:42]. This strategy of growing supply to improve product conversion and attract more traffic deeply influenced Khosrowshahi's later approach at [[Uber]] [21:09].

## Transforming [[Uber]] (2017-Present)

Khosrowshahi's journey to [[Uber]] CEO was unexpected. He initially declined a headhunter's call for the role [39:30], content with his position at Expedia [39:45]. However, a conversation with Daniel Ek, who famously told him, "Dara, since when is life about having fun? It's about having impact" [40:34], prompted him to reconsider. The recruitment process was secret, and Khosrowshahi informed Barry Diller upfront about his consideration for the job, leading to Diller's support and even assistance with his presentation to the [[Uber]] board [42:40].

### Initial State and Turnaround Strategy

Upon joining [[Uber]], Khosrowshahi faced a company experiencing "catastrophe in the boardroom, catastrophe in the c-suite" [50:00], despite its hyper-growth and global brand [49:09]. [[Uber]] was burning substantial capital (over $3 billion the year before its IPO) [01:57] and losing market share to competitors like Lyft [50:12].

His initial pitch to the board focused on "operations and how you take the business to break even and profitability" [55:39]. The core of the turnaround strategy involved:

*   **Divestment**: Shedding non-core assets such as hardware, international ventures that were too speculative, and future-oriented projects like self-driving cars (Advanced Technologies Group), bikes, scooters, and Elevate [40:40, 55:10, 01:22:21]. This allowed [[Uber]] to refocus on its core strengths.
*   **Leveraging the Marketplace**: Recognizing [[Uber]] as a "Marketplace business" with a "very fragmented Supply base" (5.6 million drivers and couriers, millions of restaurants) [21:30], Khosrowshahi applied the "supply-led" growth lessons from Booking.com [21:09].
*   **Synergy between Mobility and Eats**: By merging technical and marketplace teams, [[Uber]] capitalized on the complementary nature of its rides (Mobility) and food delivery (Eats) businesses [24:33]. Rides became the largest and most cost-effective customer acquisition channel for Eats [25:15], leveraging "proprietary traffic" at a quarter of the cost of other channels [25:32].
*   **International Expansion**: Instead of insisting on a single business model, [[Uber]] adjusted its model to be legal in various countries (e.g., Germany, Spain, Japan, Korea, Turkey), building trust and a local presence before potentially evolving their services [56:25].
*   **New Growth Bets**: Expanding into other transportation categories like taxis (wiring up every taxi in the world [01:00:02]), low-cost hailables, two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and services like [[Uber]] for Business and Health Transportation [57:02].
*   **Eats Diversification**: Expanding beyond food into grocery, liquor, and offering fulfillment services separately (e.g., Walmart uses [[Uber]] for fulfillment but not its marketplace) [57:30]. This aims to empower local businesses to "out Amazon Amazon" with same-day delivery [58:37].

### Shareholder Base Turnover and SoftBank Investment

A major challenge was the complete turnover of [[Uber]]'s shareholder base [02:26:00]. This transition from hyper-growth focused investors to "fundamental long only players" like Fidelity, Capital, and Morgan Stanley was "very painful" [01:02:55].

Khosrowshahi recounts a "prisoners dilemma" scenario during SoftBank's investment [01:09:36]. SoftBank sought to invest billions but required a large number of shares, which led to a power struggle between early shareholders (like Benchmark and Travis Kalanick) who held high-vote shares [01:07:31]. To secure the investment and prevent SoftBank from funding competitors like Lyft ("the pink company" [01:07:57]), Khosrowshahi orchestrated a collective agreement for all high-vote shares to convert to low-vote shares [01:08:20]. This unprecedented move in the tech industry not only brought in crucial capital but also ended the internal "power struggle" and allowed the company to focus on building [01:09:08].

## Leadership Philosophy and Challenges

Khosrowshahi describes leading [[Uber]] as "not fun, but it's so cool" [01:17:12]. He notes the immense complexity due to the multitude of stakeholders: customers, over 5 million drivers and couriers, and regulators/governments worldwide [01:35:43].

### Driver and Courier Experience

A critical shift in [[Uber]]'s culture under Khosrowshahi has been prioritizing the "earner experience" [01:29:10]. He admits that [[Uber]] was "guilty of taking earners for granted" due to historical oversupply of drivers [01:29:34]. The company has moved from a standard B2C optimization approach, where A/B testing was used even for sensitive elements like earnings, to a "higher duty of care" for individuals who rely on the platform for their livelihood [01:31:17]. [[Uber]] now aims to build the "best platform for earners" by listening to their experiences, even if it means slowing down development, recognizing that [[Uber]] is the world's largest source of work [01:33:08, 01:33:41].

### Take Rate Philosophy

Khosrowshahi emphasizes minimizing the "take rate" (the percentage [[Uber]] keeps from transactions) to ensure long-term growth and durability [01:25:50]. He views high take rates as "dangerous" and attributes Booking.com's success over Expedia to its lower take rate [01:26:50]. Culturally, [[Uber]] tries to "resist that notion" of increasing take rates for short-term profit, believing that "you build more durability by leaving more on the table for your ecosystem partners" [01:28:19].

## Broader Industry and Societal Views

### New York Times Board Learnings

Serving on the board of The New York Times, Khosrowshahi observed the company's transformation into a "top technical company" [01:15:46]. He was impressed by their "extraordinary learning organization" [01:15:51] and their "fascinating organization" with a "total separation of church and state" between content and business [01:16:10]. The Times' "impressive bet on subscriptions" and "quality content" was a "non-obvious" enterprise decision made during the "BuzzFeed days" [01:16:36], which ultimately proved to be a "winner of a strategy" [01:19:58].

### The Future of Self-Driving Cars

Khosrowshahi acknowledges the significant progress in self-driving cars, particularly in San Francisco where they are becoming commonplace [01:23:26]. However, he highlights the "unanswerable question" of the "last two percent" of use cases and societal acceptance of robot safety [01:20:30]. He questions what level of safety (e.g., 10 times or 100 times safer than human drivers) society will "underwrite" when fatalities, even if reduced, still occur [01:21:39].

Due to the complexities and the impact of the pandemic, [[Uber]] exited its self-driving ventures [01:22:21]. Khosrowshahi believes the "better solution is for the Waymos of the world, Auroras of the world, etc. to work with us" [01:24:40], leading to a "hybrid transition state" where both human and robot drivers operate to maintain high service coverage [01:24:50].

Dara Khosrowshahi's journey reflects a leader capable of steering large, complex organizations through immense challenges, adapting strategies, and fostering a culture focused on long-term impact and stakeholder well-being.

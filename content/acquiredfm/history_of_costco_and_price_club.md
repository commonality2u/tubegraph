From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Costco, officially Costco Wholesale Corporation, is a global retail giant known for its membership-based warehouse model, offering products in bulk at low prices. The company's deep-seated principles of providing extreme value to customers, fair treatment of employees, and respect for suppliers can be traced back through a lineage of innovative retail concepts that ultimately merged to form the modern entity. The story of Costco is not merely the tale of one company, but a continuous evolution of ideas pioneered by influential figures in discount retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

## The Genesis: Saul Price and FedMart

The true history of Costco extends significantly further back than its 1983 founding, primarily to the legendary Saul Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Born in New York City in 1916 to Jewish immigrants from Belarus, Price's early life was shaped by the harsh conditions of garment factories, reminiscent of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire era, fostering a strong social and political ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Saul Price is considered one of the most influential American retail capitalists, with [[history_of_walmart_and_sam_walton | Sam Walton]] himself admitting to having "stolen more ideas from Saul than anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Jim Sinegal, Costco's co-founder and former CEO, affirmed that he "learned everything" from Saul Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

After moving to San Diego and becoming a lawyer, Price counseled entrepreneurs creating new retail concepts in the booming post-World War II environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. He encountered FedCo, a non-profit membership club in Los Angeles open only to federal employees, which pooled buying power for better prices on goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This model, similar to [[costcos_membership_and_pricing_strategy | REI's membership today]], was not focused on profit from membership fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### FedMart: The First Discounter

Seeing FedCo's success, Price and his associates, who were wholesale jewelers, sought to open a similar operation in San Diego. After being rejected by FedCo, they decided to do it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. In November 1954, they opened **FedMart** in a 21,000-square-foot warehouse owned by Price's wife's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

FedMart was a for-profit version of FedCo, still operating as a membership club for federal employees (charging a $2 lifetime membership) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. The membership model allowed them to bypass laws that set minimum selling prices for goods sold to the "general public," thus enabling true "discounting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This innovation made FedMart the first scaled quasi-national discounter, directly influencing companies like Kmart and [[history_of_walmart_and_sam_walton | Walmart]], which adopted the "Mart" naming convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

FedMart stores were more akin to modern Walmarts, selling packaged food and general merchandise under one roof, rather than massive bulk pallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. It achieved immediate success, making $3 million in sales in its first year (1954) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

Key innovations and principles from FedMart that influenced Costco:
*   **Expansion:** Rapidly expanded to Phoenix, Houston, Dallas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   **Ancillary Services:** Added gas stations (priced a few cents lower to drive traffic) and pharmacies (undercutting high margins, leading to industry threats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. The person who eventually ran FedMart's pharmacy division went on to start Costco's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.
*   **House Brand:** Developed its own "FM brand" for popular products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.
*   **Jim Sinegal:** In 1959, Price hired Jim Sinegal as a part-time bagger. Sinegal eventually ran FedMart's entire distribution and centralized warehousing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.
*   **"Four Priority Order Principles"**:
    1.  Provide the best possible value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
    2.  Pay good wages and provide good benefits (including health insurance) to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.
    3.  Maintain honest business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
    4.  Make money for investors (last priority) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **No Loss Leaders:** Unlike other retailers, FedMart (and later Costco) refused to sell items below cost to attract customers, believing it treated customers "like they're stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.
*   **Employee Focus:** Higher wages and benefits at FedMart (and later Costco) led to extremely low employee turnover (7% at Costco today vs. 20% typical retail) and reduced shrinkage (0.15% of sales at Costco) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. This also fostered a strong promote-from-within culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

FedMart, despite its innovations, struggled to compete with larger, more capitalized Discounters like Kmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. In the late 1960s/early 1970s, Saul Price, seeking a capital partner, entered a deal with German hypermarket operator Hugo Mann <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. The partnership quickly soured, with Mann firing Price and Robert (Saul's son) from their own company, changing the locks on their office doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. FedMart ultimately failed within five years of this acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.

## Price Club: The Wholesale Warehouse Model

Incensed by his forced exit, 60-year-old Saul Price, along with Robert, immediately set out to build a new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. They decided not to compete directly with Discounters but to focus on the centralized warehousing operations Jim Sinegal had run at FedMart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. The new business plan was to create **Price Club**, a wholesale warehouse for other small businesses (gas stations, restaurants, variety stores) to stock their shelves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

The core of Price Club's model was its operational simplicity and financial efficiency:
*   **Direct Delivery:** Manufacturers delivered products directly to the warehouse, eliminating the need for Price Club to run its own logistics network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.
*   **Customer Pickup:** Business owners picked up goods directly from the warehouse, further simplifying logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.
*   **Membership Fees:** Recognizing the value provided, Price Club charged a substantial membership fee, unlike FedCo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.
*   **Low SKU Count:** To maintain operational tightness, they initially stocked only about 3,000 high-volume items, significantly less than other retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.
*   **Negative Cash Conversion Cycle:** Suppliers would invoice Price Club on "net 30" terms, but goods were sold off the floor before the invoice was due, meaning Price Club often sold products before paying for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. This effectively meant vendors financed Price Club's inventory, making it a "capital light" business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

The first Price Club store, located in a former Howard Hughes airplane hangar in San Diego, did not see immediate success with businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. However, a pivotal moment occurred when the San Diego City Credit Union approached Price Club, seeking to offer its members access to wholesale prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. This partnership unlocked a "gusher of consumers" into Price Club, leading to organic word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>. Consumers, unexpectedly, were willing to shop directly from pallets in a warehouse for lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

This consumer traffic led to the famous $1.50 hot dog and soda deal. Local hot dog vendors wanted to set up outside, so Price Club decided to offer their own, sourcing from Hebrew National <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. This hot dog deal, often seen as Costco's only potential "loss leader," remains priced at $1.50 to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.

Price Club expanded rapidly, going public in 1979 not to raise capital, but because it crossed the SEC's 500-shareholder threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>.

Price Club's influence extended across retail:
*   **Sam's Club:** In 1982, [[history_of_walmart_and_sam_walton | Sam Walton]] visited Saul Price, leading directly to the creation of [[history_of_walmart_and_sam_walton | Sam's Club]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.
*   **Home Depot:** Bernie Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot, also visited Price Club and was advised by Saul to apply the wholesale playbook to hardware stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.

## Costco's Founding and the Merger

In 1983, Seattle retailers Jeff Brotman and his father, Bernie Brotman, approached Saul Price about opening a Price Club franchise in Seattle. Price Club declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. Undeterred, Jeff Brotman cold-called Price Club's head of merchandising, who, unable to leave (as he was Saul Price's nephew), recommended Jim Sinegal, who had recently left FedMart after its acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.

Jim Sinegal, with Jeff Brotman, co-founded **Costco** in Seattle in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. They raised $7.5 million, recruited eight former FedMart and Price Club executives, and rapidly scaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. Costco hit $1 billion in revenue in less than three years and $3 billion in under six, a record at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. It went public in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>.

### The Price/Costco Merger (1993)

By the early 1990s, while Price Club was doing fine, Costco (under Jim Sinegal's aggressive expansion strategy) and [[history_of_walmart_and_sam_walton | Sam's Club]] were growing much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>. Saul Price, wanting to ensure the long-term success of his original vision, preferred a partnership with Jim Sinegal over [[history_of_walmart_and_sam_walton | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>.

In June 1993, Costco and Price Club merged to form **Price/Costco** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. This was largely a "merger of equals" in terms of store count (around 100 each) and revenue (about $8 billion each, combining to $16 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>. Jim Sinegal became the CEO of the combined entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>. This merger was crucial to compete with the aggressively expanding [[history_of_walmart_and_sam_walton | Sam's Club]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.

## Post-Merger and Modern Costco's Business Model

The combined Price/Costco continued to refine and expand upon the core principles established by Saul Price and perfected by Jim Sinegal. The business model became intentionally "boring" in its consistent growth, focused on long-term value and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>.

Key aspects of the modern [[the_costco_business_model_and_its_success | Costco business model]]:

*   **Membership Economics:**
    *   **Customer Segmentation:** Members (average household income ~$125,000/year) are wealthy and financially literate, understanding the upfront membership fee (currently $60 for basic, $120 for Executive) offers significant long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>.
    *   **Encourages Usage:** Prepaying encourages members to shop more to maximize perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>.
    *   **Reduced Shrinkage:** Members are less likely to steal to avoid losing their membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.
    *   **Executive Membership:** Launched in 1998, this tier offers 2% cash back (capped at $1,000) for an additional $60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:56">[01:53:56]</a>. The break-even point is $3,000, aligning with average household spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:42">[01:54:42]</a>. If not used, it's fully refundable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:36">[01:55:36]</a>. Executive members account for 73% of sales and renew at a higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:29">[01:56:29]</a>.
    *   **High Renewal Rate:** 93% of US members renew annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:21">[01:57:21]</a>.
    *   **Profit Driver:** Membership fees represent about 70% of Costco's operating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:19">[01:51:19]</a>.
*   [[costcos_membership_and_pricing_strategy | Costco's Membership and Pricing Strategy]]:
    *   **Strict Markup Cap:** Costco enforces a strict 14% maximum markup on any product (15% for Kirkland Signature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. This contrasts sharply with typical department store (100%) or even [[history_of_walmart_and_sam_walton | Walmart]] (25%) markups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>.
    *   **Customer Trust:** This policy builds immense customer trust that Costco is always offering the best deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.
    *   **Supplier Relations:** While "tough but fair," Costco's buyers understand commodity prices and supplier costs, ensuring that most cost reductions from suppliers are passed directly to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>. This is part of the "Respect our suppliers" tenet in their code of ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>.
*   [[costcos_supplier_relations_and_vertical_integration | Costco's Supplier Relations and Vertical Integration]]:
    *   **Kirkland Signature:** Launched around the merger, the private label brand (named after its original HQ in Kirkland, WA) has become the world's largest consumer packaged brand by revenue ($52 billion/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:47">[03:57:47]</a>. It's known for "sufficient" quality at a lower price than national brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Vertical Integration:** Costco vertically integrates (e.g., chickens, eyeglasses, coffee) when supplier concentration leads to inflated prices, allowing them to provide more value to members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:59">[02:27:59]</a>. The Fremont, Nebraska chicken processing plant produces 2 million chickens a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:42">[02:29:42]</a>.
*   **Operational Efficiency:**
    *   **Low SKU Count:** Around 3,800 SKUs today (vs. 50,000+ at Walmart), which drives higher inventory turns (12.4x per year for Costco vs. 8x for Walmart) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>. This directly supports the negative cash conversion cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.
    *   **"Intelligent Loss of Sales":** Saul Price's principle of intentionally not stocking every product size to simplify operations and reduce SKUs, even if it meant losing some sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>.
    *   **Cross-Dock Logistics:** 92% of Costco's merchandise uses a cross-dock system, where supplier trucks unload pallets directly onto Costco trucks for quick transport to stores, minimizing storage and labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:30">[01:47:30]</a>.
    *   **Labor Efficiency:** High revenue per employee ($730,000) due to simplified operations (customers do much of the "retail" work of unpacking/shelving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:15">[01:48:15]</a>.
*   **Cultural Values:**
    *   **Code of Ethics:** Heavily inspired by FedMart's values: 1. Obey the law, 2. Take care of members, 3. Take care of employees, 4. Respect suppliers, leading to the ultimate goal of rewarding shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>.
    *   **Promoting from Within:** A deeply ingrained culture where leadership (including Jim Sinegal and current CEO Craig Jelinek) rises from hourly positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:37">[02:34:37]</a>.
    *   **"Cents" Culture:** An obsession with every penny, fitting for a business with 11% gross margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Infinite Return Policy:** With few exceptions (like electronics, 90 days), items can be returned at any time, no questions asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:11">[02:49:11]</a>. Inspired by Nordstrom's policy, this builds extreme customer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:30">[02:50:30]</a>.
    *   **Treasure Hunt:** About 25% of SKUs are rotating "ooh and ah" items, encouraging repeat visits and making shopping an "entertainment event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a>.
*   **International Expansion of Costco:** Costco has expanded globally, with significant success in Asia (e.g., China's first store in 2019 rapidly gained 400,000 members, far exceeding US averages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:49">[02:43:49]</a>.

## Costco Today: A Durable Giant

Costco is a formidable force in retail, with $230 billion in revenue, 124 million members worldwide, and 860 stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. It boasts the highest revenue per square foot ($1,800) among Discounters, comparable to luxury brands like Tiffany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>. An average Costco warehouse generates over $200 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:50">[02:04:50]</a>.

Its defensibility lies in:
*   **Scale Economies Shared with Customers:** Costco leverages its massive buying power to secure the lowest prices from suppliers, then passes most of these savings to members, creating an unassailable flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:12">[02:10:12]</a>.
*   **Counter-Positioning:** Its unique in-warehouse, low-overhead model directly counters the convenience-focused, higher-cost e-commerce giants like Amazon. While slow to embrace e-commerce, Costco has found success with big and bulky item delivery and a "Costco Next" program that offers discounts on other websites using a Costco membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:11">[02:45:11]</a>.
*   **Trust and Culture:** The deep trust earned through consistent value, ethical practices, and unwavering loyalty to employees and customers creates a loyal base that rivals few other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.

Costco's history is a testament to the power of consistent execution of a well-defined, principled business model, even if it means sacrificing short-term profits for long-term durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>.

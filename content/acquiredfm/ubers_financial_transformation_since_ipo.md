Uber has undergone a significant transformation since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Four years after its IPO episode, Uber, once known for burning substantial capital, has shifted towards profitability and strategic focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Post-IPO Financial Shift
At the time of its 2019 IPO, Uber reportedly burned $3 billion the year prior, marking what was believed to be the most capital burned by any company before going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Since then, Uber has achieved a modest but notable profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Key financial metrics highlight this transformation:
*   **Revenue Growth**: In the 12 months preceding the interview, Uber generated over $30 billion in revenue, a significant increase from just $10 billion two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Divestments**: Uber has divested non-core assets, including hardware, international ventures, and speculative future technologies like self-driving cars, bikes, scooters, and even planes (Elevate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
*   **Profitability**: The company is now breaking even or slightly positive, a stark contrast to its pre-IPO state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>.

## Drivers of Transformation
The path to profitability was influenced by several strategic shifts and external factors:

### Pandemic's Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic, while painful, acted as a "huge accelerator" for Uber's Eats delivery business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Initially, the Mobility volume (the primary profit driver) plummeted by 85%, causing the company to lose $2.5 billion, which worsened during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This necessitated significant cuts in overhead and the divestment of non-core businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Supply-Led Growth Strategy
Learning from the success of Booking.com's focus on fragmented supply, Uber adopted a supply-led growth strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. After the pandemic, a key focus was on bringing drivers back to the platform, which helped Uber gain market share against competitors like Lyft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. The company currently has 5.6 million drivers and couriers, and nearly a million restaurants on its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

### Cross-Platform Advantages
Uber leverages its dual businesses, Mobility and Eats, for synergistic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
*   **Customer Acquisition**: The Rides business serves as Uber Eats' largest customer acquisition channel, bringing in more new customers at a quarter of the cost compared to other channels like Google or Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. This is managed through an internal advertising business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.
*   **Driver Recruitment**: Eats acts as a recruitment tool for drivers, as it requires fewer steps (e.g., car inspection) to start earning, allowing Uber to upsell couriers to driving or shopping opportunities later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. This cross-platform advantage leads to compounding benefits, improving margins faster than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

### Marketplace Optimization
Uber operates a massive marketplace, processing over 2 billion transactions quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Its large and capable Marketplace team, comprising ML engineers, constantly optimizes matching and pricing systems, improving throughput by approximately 5% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. This efficiency contributes to significant "free growth" on its large run rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.

Uber's pricing is largely determined by the market's "invisible hand," a spot price for labor based on supply and demand rather than internal dictates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. While ride prices increased due to inflation and rising labor costs post-pandemic, supply now grows faster than demand, causing prices to come down in some markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

### International and New Vertical Expansion
Uber adjusted its international expansion strategy by adapting its business model to local country laws rather than waiting for countries to adjust to its model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. This allowed expansion into countries like Germany, Spain, Japan, Korea, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

New "growth bets" now account for a significant portion of growth:
*   **Rides**: New initiatives such as working with taxis, low-cost hailables, two/three-wheelers, and services like Uber for Business and Health Transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.
*   **Eats**: Expansion into grocery, liquor, and a new fulfillment-only service for merchants like Walmart, aiming to enable local businesses to offer same-day delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.

### Shareholder Base Transformation
The period post-IPO also saw a significant turnover of Uber's shareholder base, from early startup investors and hedge funds to long-term institutional investors like Fidelity, Capital, and Morgan Stanley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. This difficult process involved managing massive share sales, including Travis Kalanick's decision to sell all his shares post-lockup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.

A critical moment was the **SoftBank investment** and the complex negotiation to eliminate all high-vote shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. This required unanimous agreement from all high-vote shareholders (including Travis and Benchmark), preventing SoftBank from investing in competitors like Lyft, and crucially, ending internal power struggles by removing board control mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>.

## Financial Philosophy: Minimizing Take Rates
Uber's current financial philosophy emphasizes growing volume as fast as possible while minimizing the "take rate" (the percentage of transaction value Uber retains) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. This strategy aims to:
*   **Ensure Durability**: By leaving more money with drivers and couriers, Uber creates a more sustainable and durable ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:59">[01:27:59]</a>.
*   **Promote Growth**: Low take rates encourage volume growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>.
*   **Cultural Resistance**: The company culturally resists the temptation to increase take rates for short-term profit, recognizing it as a "torture" to be incredibly efficient at the lowest possible take rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>. This approach was informed by past experiences at Expedia, where the take rate was reduced from 25% to the teens over 13 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:52">[01:26:52]</a>.

This focus on operational efficiency and a healthier take rate has allowed Uber to grow drivers' and couriers' earnings (up 30% in one recent quarter) while also expanding its own margins and achieving positive free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>.

## Focus on Earner Experience
A significant cultural shift at Uber has been a heightened "duty of care" towards its 5.6 million earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. Recognizing that earners spend hours on the app daily, Uber is moving away from optimizing the driver app like a typical B2C product. The goal is to ensure a positive experience for 90% of earners, acknowledging that 10% may always be unhappy due to the nature of the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:14">[01:32:14]</a>. This new muscle aims to connect the technology company with the "real world" impact on real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:54">[01:32:54]</a>.

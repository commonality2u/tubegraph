The foundational shift that enabled a new era of infrastructure, and indirectly laid groundwork for Amazon Web Services (AWS), was the emergence of Linux and open-source operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:49">[04:10:49]</a>. This marked a significant departure from the monolithic and proprietary systems that dominated the industry.

## The Impact of Linux and Open Source

In the pre-cloud era, technology companies would install their software codebase onto servers they owned, such as DEC Alpha servers, which were highly customized and tightly coupled to specific applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:31">[03:25:31]</a>. These systems were often leased from manufacturers and came with high profit margins for vendors like DEC, IBM, and Oracle, often reaching 80% gross margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:01">[03:46:01]</a>.

The advent of Linux fundamentally changed this landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:49">[04:10:49]</a>. With Linux, it became possible to achieve tasks previously requiring Unix workstations on an open-source operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:03">[04:16:03]</a>. This flexibility allowed companies to purchase various hardware, install Linux, and then develop their own applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:48">[04:21:48]</a>. This change demonstrated that infrastructure did not need to be prohibitively expensive, and the significant profit pools associated with it did not have to be exclusively captured by a few major vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:43">[04:28:43]</a>.

## Cost Savings and Amazon's Survival

This move to the open-source ecosystem, particularly the rewrite of [[the_evolution_of_amazon_web_services_from_amazoncom | Amazon.com]]'s entire platform to run on Linux and HP servers (instead of DEC), was instrumental in [[challenges_faced_by_amazon_preaws | saving Amazon as a company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:17">[04:46:17]</a>. Around 2000, Amazon faced severe cash constraints and high infrastructure spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:13">[04:52:13]</a>. The shift to open source provided crucial cost savings during this challenging period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:32">[04:58:32]</a>.

While this strategic move was vital for Amazon's survival from a cost perspective, it's important to note that it was distinct from the development of virtualized cloud servers that characterize AWS today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:21">[05:16:21]</a>. However, it laid crucial groundwork by demonstrating the power of flexible, less expensive infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:17">[04:46:17]</a>. Amazon's view of technology as an investment, rather than merely a cost center, further informed their [[amazon_and_aws_business_strategy_intentions | intentionality and strategy]] in building out this new infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:21">[07:01:21]</a>.

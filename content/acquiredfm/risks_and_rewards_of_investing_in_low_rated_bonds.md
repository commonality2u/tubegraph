From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Investing in low-rated bonds, often referred to as [[High Yield Bonds and Investment Strategies | high yield bonds]] or "junk bonds," has historically been viewed with skepticism by the financial community. Many investment organizations traditionally held rules against purchasing bonds rated below A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, an open-minded approach and a willingness to challenge conventional wisdom have shown that this "backwater" of the market can be a source of profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Overcoming Rigidity in Investment Philosophy

Rigidity is considered a significant barrier to profitability in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When others avoid an investment area, it can create opportunities. In the realm of [[High Yield Bonds and Investment Strategies | high yield bonds]], a lack of bidders at an auction is typically a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The importance of open-mindedness and continuously evolving one's thinking is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### The Milken Connection and Early Discoveries

Mike Milken, a prominent figure in the [[History and Evolution of Junk Bonds | low rated debt]] market, was interested in low-rated bonds early in his career, starting around 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He reportedly found a famous book by Hickman, which analyzed bond experiences from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Hickman's research revealed that the lower a bond's rating, the higher its actual realized total rate of return tended to be, not just its promised yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This held true even accounting for defaults and bankruptcies, including those during the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The excess yield offered by these bonds was more than sufficient to offset credit losses, leading to an "aha moment" for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Historically, it was nearly impossible to issue low-rated bonds, which were labeled "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Major banks and underwriters avoided them, with Moody's manual even defining a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This stance often ignored the crucial factor of price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## The Life Insurance Analogy: Understanding and Managing Risk

A key insight into [[Balancing Risks and Opportunities in Changing Markets | investing]] in high-yield bonds comes from an analogy to life insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Life insurance companies are among the most conservative businesses in America, yet they insure lives despite knowing everyone will eventually die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This success is due to four critical factors, which also apply to high-yield bond investing:

1.  **Risk Awareness**: The risk is known and anticipated; defaults are not a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
2.  **Analyzable Risk**: The risk can be analyzed, similar to how insurance companies assess an individual's health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
3.  **Diversifiable Risk**: Risks can be diversified across a portfolio, avoiding concentration in highly correlated or risky segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
4.  **Well-Compensated Risk**: Investors are well-paid to take the risk, meaning the yield compensates for potential losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This effectively builds a margin of safety into the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Applying these principles, investors in [[High Yield Bonds and Investment Strategies | high yield bonds]] have consistently made money by investing in companies that, while publicly considered "the worst," offered attractive compensation for the risks involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## [[Comparison of High Yield Bonds and the Nifty 50 | Contrast with "The Nifty 50"]]

This approach stands in stark contrast to the [[Comparison of High Yield Bonds and the Nifty 50 | "Nifty 50"]] investment philosophy prevalent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which Citibank, among others, championed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The Nifty 50 comprised companies considered the "best and fastest growing" in America, thought to be immune to negative events and worth any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

*   For the [[Comparison of High Yield Bonds and the Nifty 50 | Nifty 50]], "no price was too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   For [[High Yield Bonds and Investment Strategies | high yield bonds]], the prevailing view was "no price was low enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Both stances proved to be incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Investing in the Nifty 50, even in the best companies, led to significant losses over five years because they were severely overpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While the average post-war S&P P/E ratio was around 16, many Nifty 50 stocks traded between 60 and 90 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### The Illusion of Invincibility

Some Nifty 50 companies suffered not just from high prices but also from fundamental weaknesses or market disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Examples include:

*   **IBM**: While not going bankrupt, it faced significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Xerox**: Lost market share to imports and needed a new business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Patterns**: A consumer company that suffered due to changing consumer habits (less home sewing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The concept of disruption was largely ignored; "moats" were considered inviolable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This thinking failed to account for competitors, especially from abroad, who could undercut high-priced products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Many of these "best" companies saw declines of over 90% from their peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[Market Pricing and Investment Pitfalls | market pricing]] in investment success, regardless of perceived company quality.

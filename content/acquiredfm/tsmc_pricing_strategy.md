From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

[[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]] employs a pricing strategy that prioritizes future gains over immediate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This approach aims to secure future revenues through customer retention and the acquisition of new clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The expectation is that an increase in customers and revenue will lead to greater differential returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Unusual Scale Economies

This strategy is rooted in the presence of unusual scale economies within the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While scale economies generally exist for [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]], they are characterized by several unique industry traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Unique Industry Characteristics

The [[Technological and Business Strategies of TSMC | technological and business strategies]] of [[TSMC and its importance in global supply chains | TSMC]] are heavily influenced by the distinct characteristics of the semiconductor industry:

*   **Massive Capital Investment** The construction of a new fabrication plant (fab) requires an extremely large, lumpy capital investment, estimated to be upwards of $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Predictable Performance Advances** Unlike most industries, there are "predictable material performance advances" driven by phenomena like Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This means that with the right [[the_impact_of_technological_advancements_on_tsmcs_growth | technological choices]], companies can have a high assurance of significant performance improvements (e.g., 10x improvement in 18 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This predictability, which is highly unusual in most business environments, is driven by making correct [[the_impact_of_technological_advancements_on_tsmcs_growth | technology choices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Upstream Suppliers** [[the_impact_of_technological_advancements_on_tsmcs_growth | Technological advantages]] in the industry are significantly driven by upstream suppliers, such as ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This reliance highlights a difficult strategic choice for [[technological_and_geopolitical_issues_facing_tsmc_and_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor companies]], as evidenced by past debates regarding technologies like X-ray lithography where substantial investment was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

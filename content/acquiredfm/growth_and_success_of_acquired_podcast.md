The podcast *Acquired*, hosted by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, has experienced significant growth and success, culminating in large-scale live events and substantial listenership.

## Origins and Early Days
Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal first met at Greg Goddisdman's Passover seder in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. David had several podcast ideas, while Ben was unfamiliar with the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Ben was particularly enthusiastic about the *Acquired* concept, committing to it immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Breakthrough and Metrics
The podcast's significant breakout is perceived by the hosts to have occurred within the last six months (as of the video's context) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. A turning point was a *Wall Street Journal* article published in May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This article led to an influx of a quarter-million new subscribers within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The podcast has accumulated over 5 million hours of listenership, tripling in the last year alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Strategic Partnerships and Live Events
The ability to host large-scale events, such as the one at Chase Center, is contingent on successful partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The podcast sought a partner who deeply understood the show's essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### The Chase Center Event
The *Acquired Live at Chase Center* event originated from a call with the JP Morgan team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. JP Morgan initially suggested a small event at the Chase Center, which sparked the idea for a dedicated live show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The JP Morgan Payments team then developed the proposal for a full-scale live event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

The collaboration with JP Morgan Payments was described as "really special," leading to the event's grand scale, from posters to stage art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The partnership enabled something neither party could have achieved alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. JP Morgan Payments' approach allowed *Acquired* to "just go be acquired," integrating payments as a "centerpiece" in the story of building businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

#### Event Preparation and Artistic Vision
Preparations involved a "mad dash to create an amazing experience for every single one of the thousands of people that are there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This included decisions on opening videos featuring figures like Jensen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> and considering who would walk on stage with Perkins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Don, the artist behind the event's visual identity, worked on the stage and stadium art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He had previously designed hundreds of album packages and concert posters, but seeing an entire stadium lit up with his work was a unique experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The artwork aimed to embody the *Acquired* brand physically, creating an immersive "acquired universe" for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Don's initial idea featured silhouettes of Ben and David, with imagery emanating from them, creating a "big and grandiose and bright" visual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Ticket sales were robust, with only around 300 tickets remaining shortly before the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Confirmed guests included Emily Chang, Daniel X, and Mike Taylor of JP Morgan Payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Mike Taylor, a major recording artist with hundreds of millions of Spotify listens, was a highlight, performing the *Acquired* theme song live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

#### Event Highlights
On the day of the event, Ben and David maintained their tradition of going for a run together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This pre-show run allowed them to interact with over 100 listeners and manage their nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Upon taking the stage at Chase Center, the hosts expressed disbelief at the turnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The event was described as "beyond anything that we could have hoped or dreamed for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

A key segment was the interview with Mark Zuckerberg, where the hosts adopted a "lean forward mode" to engage with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Their strategy was to ask Zuckerberg to assist with [[acquired_podcast_format_and_content_strategy | meta episode research]] live on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. A notable moment was Zuckerberg admitting to a "20-year mistake" regarding Facebook/Meta's political miscalculation, which stunned the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Looking ahead, the hosts acknowledge being in a mindset of both "let's go big" and "never again," balancing ambition with the demands of young families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The idea of a 2025 event was also hinted at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

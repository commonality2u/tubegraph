The [[GameStop Meme Stock Hearings | GameStop meme stock craze]] and its aftermath became a significant area of focus for the House Financial Services Committee, alongside [[congressional_focus_on_crypto | crypto]] and China-related capital markets work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Committee members actively followed discussions on forums like [[the_role_and_impact_of_retail_stock_trading_and_gambling_in_the_investment_market | Wall Street bets]] during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Legislative Frustration and Missed Opportunities

Despite extensive engagement, including four hearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> and national media attention, no meaningful legislation emerged from the meme stock mania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. There was disappointment over the lack of concrete outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

A key bipartisan proposal that was considered smart was to shorten the settlement time for stock trades from two days to one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This change was expected to reduce systemic risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> and potentially prevent situations like Robinhood halting trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

However, instead of pursuing such specific, bipartisan solutions, a bill was passed by the House that incorporated various long-standing proposals that Democrats had wanted to enact for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This comprehensive bill is not expected to advance in the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, meaning no significant changes have occurred in the wake of the meme stock events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

This outcome highlights the frustrations of the Washington political process, where issues can become "political casualties" despite significant effort and public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Committee Experience

During the [[GameStop Meme Stock Hearings | meme stock hearings]], which were conducted remotely, one member of Congress had two computers set up: one for the official hearing and another to monitor the [[the_role_and_impact_of_retail_stock_trading_and_gambling_in_the_investment_market | Wall Street bets]] forum in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This allowed for immediate feedback on how members' questions were being received by the online community, with participants on the forum often "eviscerating" those speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

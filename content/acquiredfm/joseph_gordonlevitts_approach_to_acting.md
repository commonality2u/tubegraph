[[Joseph Gordon-Levitt's approach to acting]] involves a deep dive into character, a willingness to portray complexity, and a focus on intrinsic artistic satisfaction over external validation.

### Project Selection and Motivation

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is drawn to projects that offer compelling dialogue and themes. For the show *Super Pumped*, he found the dialogue to be "fireworks" and "fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. A significant draw was the opportunity to embody an uninhibited, "animal instinct" that seeks to "take what you want and sh*t everybody else" without facing immediate consequences, which he considers part of human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

He views the story of Uber as an "excellent example" of a larger trend where the modus operandi is "profits above all" and "growth growth growth," regardless of impact on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Gordon-Levitt believes this mentality is currently acute and driving humanity "off a cliff," making it a crucial story for his generation to tell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. He was also excited by the opportunity to "play with form" and "f***ing with storytelling conventions" in a mainstream project, using "non-mainstream filmmaking techniques" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

His agent, Warren Zavala, has been a "fantastic confidant and collaborator" since Gordon-Levitt was 19. Zavala rarely brings him material with the same enthusiasm as he did for *Super Pumped*, knowing that Gordon-Levitt "hate[s] almost everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Character Research and Portrayal

For *Super Pumped*, Gordon-Levitt read Mike Isaac's book and had a few conversations with the author <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. Crucially, he talked to numerous people who worked closely with Travis Kalanick to understand not just events, but "how it felt" to interact with him and what he was "personally like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. His goal was to portray a "whole human," not to "reduce this person to these headlines" about "questionable decisions" or "unethical behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. He learned that many people found Kalanick "inspiring," "compelling," and full of "energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

His aim was to "make the audience love this guy" before confronting them with the "seemingly terrible things" he did, thereby highlighting the complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. Despite often playing likable characters, Gordon-Levitt believes portraying confident figures like Kalanick can be "instantly winning" for audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. When playing a character with unsavory traits, he would instantly apologize after a take, reassuring his colleagues that "it's not me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

### On-Set Challenges and Artistic Philosophy

Gordon-Levitt notes that while acting affords many "amazing things in life," the "work required" is "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. He describes the daily schedule on a show set as a "hornet's nest of logistical nightmares," with minimum 12-hour days, often extending to 13-15 hours, and a required 12-hour turnaround between shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. Lunch can occur as late as 9 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

When performing with a green screen or tape on a laptop, he equates the process to "playing pretend" as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. The true challenge, however, is maintaining focus and a "childlike spirit of imagination" amidst the "morass of logistical crap" on a busy, noisy set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

He acknowledges that artists often know if their work is bad during production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. Conversely, a project he personally liked, *Mr. Corman*, was not picked up for a second season, which he found "humbling and a learning experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. He values Apple for letting him make something "very particular" that wasn't trying to "pander to any particular commercial bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

Gordon-Levitt strongly believes in intrinsic motivation. He shared an anecdote about Ryan Johnson sending him *Letters to a Young Poet* by Rainer Maria Rilke after a short film he made was rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. The book's core message, which he applies to his art, is to "forget about all that" external validation and "go into yourself" to find your "unique voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>. He emphasizes that being an artist "isn't about money and popularity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.

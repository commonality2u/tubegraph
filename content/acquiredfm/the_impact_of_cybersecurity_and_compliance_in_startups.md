Cybersecurity and compliance have become increasingly critical for startups, evolving from a defensive checkbox exercise to a strategic offensive play in the business world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Evolution of Security and Compliance

Historically, especially around 2018, the idea of startups needing certifications like SOC 2 was met with perplexity by venture capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. However, this perception has drastically changed.

Today, demonstrating robust security and compliance measures is considered "table stakes" for Business-to-Business (B2B) companies, particularly those seeking to [[challenges_and_strategies_in_fundraising_for_startups | raise funding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Vanta, a company at the forefront of this evolution, now serves a majority of the Y Combinator (YC) batch, illustrating how crucial these reports are for new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Unlocking Revenue and Market Access

Security and compliance reports directly assist startups in generating revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They facilitate the opening of new markets, including:
*   International markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
*   Enterprise clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
*   Healthcare and other regulated industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>

In the 2022 [[challenges_and_adaptations_in_venture_capital | funding environment]], a significant emphasis is placed on "Revenue growth from secure trusted sources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This environment is expected to lead to more companies moving "up Market faster" than previously observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Building Trust and Credibility

For larger corporations, their security is intrinsically linked to the security of their vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A breach experienced by a vendor effectively reflects on the larger company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This understanding leads to increasing scrutiny and higher expectations for startups regarding their security posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

By obtaining security and compliance certifications, startups can:
*   Secure stable customers who are likely to expand over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   Sell to large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Prove their credibility, even if they lack the tenure of more established competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   Demonstrate that they responsibly handle customer data entrusted to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Establish themselves as "good and trusted business partners for the long run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

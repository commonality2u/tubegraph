The location of a customer's data plays a critical role in determining where their machine learning (ML) workloads are executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Running machine learning near the data is considered the most important factor for efficiency and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Primacy of Data Location for ML

Once a customer has chosen a specific vendor, such as Amazon, to be their storage provider and has migrated their data into that vendor's data centers, they are unlikely to seek out other providers for their ML operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Instead, they will run their machine learning on the same platform where their data resides, for example, on AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Amazon's Strategy with ML and Data

While compute is a significant pillar of Amazon's business, databases have emerged as increasingly important, particularly from a "stickiness" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Amazon consistently announces new database offerings annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

For machine learning, Amazon has developed services like SageMaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> and provides a wide array of [[amazons_cloudhosted_ml_services | cloud hosted ML offerings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. They support frameworks like TensorFlow (originally developed by Google) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and offer both their own container service (ECS) and an elastic Kubernetes service (EKS) to cater to customer preferences, while encouraging the use of their proprietary services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Amazon's machine learning capabilities need to be competent, but they do not necessarily need to surpass those of competitors like Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The strategic advantage lies in being the primary storage vendor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Competitive Implications

This strategy highlights that even if a competitor like Google might be better positioned to offer superior ML services, it becomes less relevant if they are not the chosen platform for data storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The integration with existing data storage solutions effectively locks in customers for ML workloads.

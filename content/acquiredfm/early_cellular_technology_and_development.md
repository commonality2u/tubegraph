The [[the_evolution_of_wireless_technology_and_cdma | Wireless Communications industry]] began to emerge around 1985 [02:47:00]. At this point, the cellular telephone industry had just started [02:58:00].

## 1G Cellular: The Analog Era
The earliest form of cellular technology, known as 1G, was entirely analog [03:15:00]. This differed from later digital advancements seen in 2G (like the Edge Network the first iPhone launched with) [03:10:00]. The core innovation of cellular technology was the concept of using cell towers, allowing phones to communicate only with a local tower that could then relay the signal, creating a "cellularification" of covered geography [03:25:00].

### Car Phones
In the 1980s, early cellular technology predominantly manifested as car phones [04:17:00]. These systems functioned like high-power FM radio broadcasters [04:25:00]. They required significant power, often needing to be wired into a vehicle's power supply or even a running internal combustion engine due to the lack of available batteries [04:30:00].

### Limitations of Early Cellular
Early cellular systems faced several limitations:
*   **Cost:** Systems were thousands of dollars in early 1980s currency [04:53:00].
*   **Bandwidth:** Bandwidth was extremely limited [04:50:00]. Analog systems did not allow for efficient use of channels [05:19:00]. This was akin to FM radio where frequencies like 99.1, 99.3, and 99.5 could not have intermediate values due to interference [05:41:00]. A cell tower in this analog setup could handle only a limited number of phones, likely not much more than a hundred [06:06:00].
*   **Demand:** Despite these limitations, consumer demand for car phones was immense, with wait lists often years long [05:01:00]. Fledgling carriers struggled to keep up with the demand due to the restricted bandwidth [05:13:00].

## Evolution of Multiple Access Technologies

### Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
The initial method for dividing up airwaves for multiple conversations was called Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) [12:54:00]. In this system, each conversation or communication was allocated its own specific frequency [12:53:00]. This method was effective in the analog world where multiple calls on the same frequency would collide [12:07:00].

### Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
The next iteration in wireless technology was Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) [15:27:00]. This innovation allowed digital signals to be transmitted more efficiently [15:15:00]. In TDMA, rather than each person having an entire frequency, information is parceled into digital packets [13:42:00]. Since conversations have pauses, the entire frequency is not needed all the time [13:30:00]. Different users could take turns transmitting their digital packets in rotating time slots on the same frequency [14:06:00]. While the signal might sound slightly compressed, it appears smooth to the user [14:28:00]. This concept is similar to time-sharing in old computing models [15:38:00]. TDMA offered a significant capacity increase (three to five times more efficient than FDMA) [15:32:00] and was ready for implementation in Europe, driven by companies like Ericsson [14:51:00].

## Qualcomm's Vision: Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
[[Founding of Qualcomm and contributions to the wireless industry | Qualcomm]], founded in July 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, Andrew Viterbi, and five other Linkabit engineers [06:35:00], recognized the immense opportunity in digital cellular networks [10:09:00]. They aimed to become the dominant company in this burgeoning industry [10:19:00]. However, they knew they couldn't immediately enter the market, so they began with consulting work [10:24:00].

One of their first consulting projects was with Hughes on a proposal to the FCC for a mobile satellite network [10:35:00]. While working on optimizing satellite communication channels for efficiency, they developed an application of spread spectrum technology [11:08:00]. This led them to a technique called [[adoption_and_impact_of_cdma_technology | Code Division Multiple Access]] ([[the_evolution_of_wireless_technology_and_cdma | CDMA]]) [11:29:00].

### How CDMA Works
[[CDMA]] allows multiple conversations to access the same channel simultaneously [11:21:00]. Unlike FDMA (everyone gets their own frequency) or TDMA (people take turns on a frequency), [[CDMA]] enables all conversations to be sent at the same time across all different channels [17:01:00]. It maximizes the efficient use of the allocated spectrum [17:05:00].

The core idea of [[CDMA]] involves appending a unique digital code to the beginning of each conversation [17:09:00]. All messages are encoded digitally and layered on top of each other, creating a complex digital wave [18:49:00]. When the signal arrives at the receiving end, the receiver knows how to decode the messages [19:05:00]. It disregards any messages that don't match the specific code it's listening for, effectively "subtracting" other layered messages to isolate the desired one [19:09:00]. This is similar to how the internet uses packet switching [16:23:00].

The analogy often used for [[CDMA]] is a dinner party where everyone speaks in their own language in the same room [17:52:00]. A listener, understanding only one language, can listen for and disregard the "noise" from other conversations [18:00:00].

### The Value of CDMA Patent
[[Qualcomm]]'s engineers, with their background from Claude Shannon, sought the most efficient way to use spectrum, pushing towards theoretical limits [15:56:00]. They developed and patented the method and technique for [[CDMA]] applied to terrestrial cellular networks in 1986 [19:47:00]. This patent (U.S. Patent number 4,901,307) became one of the most valuable patents in history [20:04:00].

The value of the [[CDMA]] patent lay in its ability to allow users to broadcast their messages across available frequencies at all times, with the technology on the other side capable of figuring out the message [20:30:00]. Furthermore, it did not require super high power, which was beneficial for battery life, eliminating the need for an internal combustion engine to power devices [20:50:00]. This made it a significantly more efficient way to use a given medium for maximum signal transmission [21:07:00]. The strategic execution of [[Qualcomm]] in entering the market with this innovation is considered one of the most brilliant in history [09:27:00].

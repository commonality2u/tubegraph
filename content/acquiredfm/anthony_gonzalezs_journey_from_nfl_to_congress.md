Anthony Gonzalez is a United States Congressman serving from Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. His career path is notably non-linear, transitioning from professional football to business and then to public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.

## Early Life and Family Background

Gonzalez's family immigrated from Cuba after the revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>. His father immigrated from Cuba, while his mother was born and raised in Cincinnati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:25">[09:46:25]</a>. The family legend states his Cuban grandparents ran out of money in Ohio while honeymooning on a trip from New York City to Miami, leading them to stop there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:45">[10:04:45]</a>. His grandfather admired the U.S. and its democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

After Fidel Castro took over Cuba, Gonzalez's family was driven into exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. His grandfather, part of a pro-democracy movement, turned down a position offered by Castro's lieutenant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. This refusal forced them to hide in jungles and around Havana until their visas were processed, allowing them to legally come to Miami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. They eventually moved to Cincinnati, where his father met his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

Gonzalez grew up in Northeast Ohio, where his father started a steel company that he still runs today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. He noted the significant decline in car manufacturing plants and jobs in the region during his lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:23:00">[26:23:00]</a>. He recounts seeing the "smoke coming out of" the LTV Steel factory as a childhood indicator of economic well-being in Northeast Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:53:00">[26:53:00]</a>.

## Football Career

Gonzalez played football at Ohio State, a decision influenced by a negative recruiting visit to Michigan where he was mistaken for a kicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>. Ohio State's coach, Jim Tressel, made a strong impression, leading to Gonzalez's commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. He studied philosophy at Ohio State, intending to go to law school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.

He was drafted in the first round of the NFL draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>. He played for the Indianapolis Colts, catching touchdowns from Peyton Manning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. His NFL career was cut short due to recurring injuries in his third and fourth years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. He signed with the Patriots after the Colts, where Bill Belichick "unceremoniously fired" him due to injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>.

## Transition to Business and Academia

During his third year in the NFL, while injured, Gonzalez attended a business program at Harvard Business School (HBS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>. This experience solidified his decision to pursue business school after football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. He then attended Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Before serving in Congress, he ran a venture-backed startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, which he felt was "somewhat like a startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>.

## Entry into Politics

Gonzalez initially envisioned entering public service later in life, after a long business career and raising a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. However, the 2016 election prompted him to run for Congress earlier than planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. He felt the country was on a "pretty dangerous path politically" and felt an urgency to contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.

He approached his campaign like a startup, conducting "customer interviews" with people in his district to understand their motivations and test his message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>. His primary message in his 2018 campaign focused on economic issues and a "unity message" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>. He aimed to rebuild the economy and promote working together to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>.

He built a strong campaign team and focused on fundraising, using a custom Salesforce dashboard to track progress like sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>. He aimed for broad support, not just from wealthy donors, as a low average contribution number indicates wider grassroots support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:00]</a>. His first campaign had a budget of $2 million for the primary, raising approximately $600,000 in the first month to signal strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:00">[29:15:15]</a>.

## Congressional Role and Key Issues

As a U.S. Congressman, Gonzalez served on three committees:
*   House Financial Services Committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>
*   Science, Space, and Technology Committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>
*   Climate Committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>

He found committees to be where the "real work happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:45:00">[45:45:00]</a>, involving detailed policy discussions and debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:55:00">[45:55:00]</a>.

### January 6th and Impeachment Vote
Gonzalez recounts his experience on January 6th, 2021, expressing deep unease leading up to the event due to the rhetoric from the White House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a>. He tried to get his message out that the election was not stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>. On January 6th, he observed the growing crowd and signs, realizing it would be "a lot worse than [he] even thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:10:00">[37:10:00]</a>. During the breach, he hid in his office, changing clothes to avoid being identified as a member of Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:18:00">[39:18:00]</a>. He called the White House, urging the president to call off the rioters, but it took hours for a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>.

Gonzalez viewed the event as an "unforgivable assault on the country" led and inspired by the former president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:25:00">[40:25:00]</a>. He voted in favor of the second impeachment of the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>, despite having voted against the first impeachment related to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>. His decision was based on sending a clear message to future presidents that such actions would lead to impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:19:00">[42:19:00]</a>. He characterized it as the hardest professional decision he ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:41:00">[42:41:00]</a>, understanding it would make a subsequent term difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency and Web3 Regulation
Gonzalez started going deep on crypto in 2020 after listening to a podcast on Flamingo DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:00:00">[47:00:00]</a>. He realized the potential impact of decentralized systems on society, capital markets, and access to financial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:35:00">[47:35:00]</a>. To better understand the space, he personally experimented with DeFi using a small amount of margin, which he later donated to the United Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>. He avoids investing in crypto assets while regulating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:27:00">[48:27:00]</a>.

Gonzalez notes that about 90% of Congress members do not understand crypto, 5% are getting up to speed on the Financial Services Committee, and another 5% (including himself) have spent significant time developing clear views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>. He observed that younger members are more likely to engage with crypto, while senior members are more skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:56:00">[51:56:00]</a>. He believes that the President's working group signaling the importance of crypto has jump-started legislative efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:39:00">[52:39:00]</a>.

He advocates for a "do no harm" approach to crypto regulation, similar to the Clinton administration's approach to the early internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. He believes the initial focus should be on stablecoins, particularly fiat-backed stablecoins, addressing reserves, auditing, and consumer protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. He argues that clear regulation protects consumers and encourages innovation by reducing uncertainty for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.

### [[disappointment_in_legislative_outcomes_from_meme_stock_hearings | Meme Stock Hearings]]
Gonzalez was involved in the hearings related to the GameStop meme stock craze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>. He was disappointed that no meaningful legislation came out of it, despite extensive hearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. He believed a bipartisan bill to shorten settlement times from two days to one day would have reduced risk in the system, but it fell victim to political maneuvering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. He observed the [[congressman_anthony_gonzalezs_experience_with_online_forums_during_hearings | Wall Street Bets forum]] during the hearings, seeing real-time feedback on members' comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>.

### [[congressional_focus_on_financial_institutions_and_china | China and Financial Institutions]]
A significant portion of his first year in Congress was dedicated to work on China, including reforms for international financial institutions like the World Bank and the IMF, which he felt had been "overrun by China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.

### [[legal_and_ethical_challenges_faced_by_the_nfl | NCAA Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL)]]
Gonzalez has been highly involved in the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) debate, advocating for college athletes to monetize their NIL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>. He believed it was illogical for college athletes to be the only individuals unable to profit from their NIL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. He cites his wife, a former Stanford swimmer, who was not allowed to teach swimming lessons to help pay bills, despite her expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:48">[01:19:48]</a>.

He championed a national standard for NIL, providing economic rights to athletes while establishing guardrails against inducements and recruiting violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. The current landscape, after the NCAA lost a Supreme Court case and stopped enforcing NIL rules, has become "the wild west," with "collectives" raising marketing dollars to buy players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>. He views this as unsustainable, lacking transparency (especially regarding agent commissions), and potentially leading to the professionalization of college sports, which could eliminate opportunities for non-revenue-generating sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.

### American Dynamism and Industrial Policy
Gonzalez views the current global crossroads as a battle between American democracy and authoritarianism, criticizing those who "destroy and tear down" democratic institutions when things don't go their way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of American leadership rooted in values of individual dignity and rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>.

He advocates for an economic policy focused on building a "sustainable, dynamic, and resilient economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>. For dynamism, he believes the U.S. should lead in every critical technology, from AI to machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:35">[01:40:35]</a>, noting the concern of companies like FTX being based outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:56">[01:40:56]</a>. On resiliency, he points to COVID-19 exposing the fragility of over-optimized supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a>. He believes critical technologies and supply chains should be domestic or with trusted allies, while non-critical manufacturing can be offshored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>. He specifically mentions semiconductors as mission-critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a> and supports the Chips Act to reshore semiconductor manufacturing to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>, citing Intel's massive investment in Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:12">[01:47:12]</a>.

Gonzalez sees innovation as the solution to the sustainability-dynamism dilemma, advocating for government investment in R&D to develop cheap and reliable green alternatives, such as clean steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:24">[01:45:24]</a>. He highlighted emerging tech scenes in Ohio, such as the software and insurance industry in Columbus, partly due to Drive Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, and the medical innovation in Northeast Ohio with Cleveland Clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>.

## Future Plans

Gonzalez is not running for re-election, choosing to focus on finishing his current term strong by pushing legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:41">[01:52:41]</a>. He is re-evaluating his career path, considering whether to be an investor or an operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:20">[01:53:20]</a>. His main priority for his next chapter is working with people he loves and admires on exciting new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>. He advises founders to focus on industries with "enormous tailwinds" and leverage their unique skills while surrounding themselves with people they love and admire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:35">[01:57:35]</a>.

The practices and traditions of a venture capital firm, particularly those related to fostering open discussion and [[venture_capital_strategies_and_the_importance_of_optimism | curiosity]], are considered essential to its success and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## The Origin of a Tradition: Nurturing Curiosity

When Peter joined Benchmark, there was an optimistic vision shared with Bill to introduce new practices and habits into the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Inspired by Ben Franklin's biography, which detailed his regular, deep-dive dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, the idea of firm dinners was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The first experimental dinner took place in 2006, Peter's first year, involving the partners and four outside guests: Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This initial gathering was described as "electric" and a moment where "time stood still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Habits as the Lifeblood of a Firm

Firms are fundamentally a "collection of habits," a concept derived from William James's philosophy that individuals are an "amalgamation of our habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. These habits are crucial as they "sow character" and influence every aspect of the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

For a venture firm, nurturing [[venture_capital_strategies_and_the_importance_of_optimism | curiosity]] is seen as its "essential lifeblood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. While traditional Monday meetings attempt to foster discussion, they are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Dinners, however, allow for "open-ended, no agenda, wild explorations" of varied topics, enabling partners to delve into and extract each other from "rat holes" of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This tradition honors the firm's core purpose: "constantly learning and activating our [[venture_capital_strategies_and_the_importance_of_optimism | curiosity]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, leading to a "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved in one-on-one settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## The Design of Discussion: The Non-Hierarchical Table

A significant challenge in group discussions is the presence of a "dominant participant" or a table structure that reinforces hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Rectangular tables carry an embedded "power structure," while circular tables "atomize the group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

To address this, a unique table, "the seven," designed by French designer Jean-Marie Masoud, was envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The aim was to create an organic structure that could expand and collapse, most importantly, "deconstruct power centers and create a non-hierarchical construct with intimacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The current table used by the firm was designed by Ole Lundberg based on a hand sketch, and its unique design has been sought after by many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

The table's structure reflects the firm's ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. It prevents "sidebar conversations" because everyone can hear, ensuring "it's all one conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This "one conversation element" is powerful in ensuring the "whole group [is] tuned in" to whatever is being discussed, whether it's good, bad, or tough news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Honoring Esteemed Guests

The dinners frequently host "esteemed guests" beyond just the five partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Giving the "spotlight of attention" to guests is considered the "biggest gift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Often, these guests are individuals the firm has not yet worked with or invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Notable past guests include Dylan Field, Tobi LÃ¼tke from Shopify, and Jeff Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These interactions, described as "swept off your feet," reinforce the firm's purpose: "to serve people like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. While the table is not portable, the firm has held these dynamic discussions in various locations, including Seattle and Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## A Culture of True Discussion: No Pre-Selling

The firm's approach to open discussion contrasts sharply with traditional venture capital practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Unlike the advice an older partner might give to "pre-sell" ideas to everyone before bringing them up at a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, Benchmark enforces a strict rule: "no pre-selling a deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This ensures that all discussions, especially those concerning potential investments, are genuine, unfiltered, and take place with the entire group "tuned in" at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

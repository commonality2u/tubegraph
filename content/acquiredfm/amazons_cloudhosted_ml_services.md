[[Amazons machine learning strategy | Machine learning]] (ML) has emerged as a significant pillar for [[Amazon Web Services AWS history and origin stories | Amazon's]] cloud business, complementing its massive compute and databases offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While databases are crucial for customer stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, ML receives dedicated attention, including its own custom ML keynote at annual events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Key Offerings and Strategy

[[Amazon Web Services AWS history and origin stories | Amazon]] provides a broad range of cloud-hosted ML offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Noteworthy services include:
*   [[SageMaker and custom ML offerings | SageMaker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   Support for TensorFlow, a framework created by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Their proprietary container service, Amazon Container Service (ECS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), catering to customers who prefer Kubernetes, although [[Amazon Web Services AWS history and origin stories | Amazon]] aims to encourage the use of their custom ECS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Competitive Positioning

[[Amazons machine learning strategy | Amazon's strategy]] for its ML capabilities emphasizes practicality over absolute superiority. While their ML services need to be good, they don't necessarily need to surpass [[Comparison of Amazons ML capabilities with Googles | Google's offerings in terms of raw capability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The core of [[Amazons machine learning strategy | Amazon's ML strategy]] lies in the principle that users will leverage ML tools available where their data resides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Running machine learning operations near the data is considered the most critical factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Consequently, once customers choose [[Amazon Web Services AWS history and origin stories | Amazon]] as their storage vendor and transfer large volumes of data to its data centers, they are highly likely to conduct their ML operations on [[Amazon Web Services AWS history and origin stories | AWS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This approach suggests that even if [[Comparison of Amazons ML capabilities with Googles | Google]] might be theoretically better positioned to offer superior ML tools, it matters less if they aren't the primary storage provider for customer data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This focus on data gravity allows [[Amazon Web Services AWS history and origin stories | Amazon]] to maintain its competitive edge without needing to lead in every specific ML innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

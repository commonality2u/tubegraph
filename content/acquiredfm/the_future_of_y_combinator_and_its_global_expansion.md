Y Combinator (YC), initially known for its accelerator program that produced companies like Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe, has evolved significantly, particularly with the introduction of its [[yc_continuity_and_growthstage_investing | Continuity Fund]] and a shift to a remote-first operational model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. This evolution highlights a clear vision for the future, emphasizing global reach, continuous founder support, and an expanded definition of "startup" success.

## Remote-First Operations and Global Reach

Since the pandemic, YC has adopted a remote-first approach, with all batches now conducted entirely remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. This shift has eliminated the previous requirement for founders to physically relocate to Mountain View, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. YC has adapted all aspects of its operations, from application reviews and interviews to running batches and demo days, to a fully remote setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

This change has had a profound impact on YC's global expansion, with 50% of its batches now being international <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. YC has invested in companies across diverse regions, including India (where the top three breakout companies in the last two years are YC alumni), London, Latin America, and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. This aligns with YC's mission to enable entrepreneurship globally, recognizing that talent is universally distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.

## The Role of [[yc_continuity_and_growthstage_investing | YC Continuity]]

The [[yc_continuity_and_growthstage_investing | YC Continuity]] Fund, launched in July 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>, is a multi-stage fund primarily focused on growth-stage investments (Series B and above) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. Its creation stemmed from YC alumni requesting continued support beyond the accelerator program, particularly as the median time to IPO stretched to 11 years in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.

[[yc_continuity_and_growthstage_investing | Continuity]]'s goal is to be a "lifelong partner" for YC companies, providing not just capital but also extensive post-batch programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. This includes:
*   **Series A Program:** Teaching founders how to prepare pitch decks, negotiate term sheets, and identify investors, typically six to nine months before they raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.
*   **Post-A Program:** A six-week program that "re-batches" companies to form new peer groups, with experienced YC founders teaching about recruiting, hiring engineers, and adapting to the CEO role as the company scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
*   **Growth Program:** An eight-week session focusing on scaling as a CEO, covering topics like hiring executives, performance management, and culture, with insights from successful founders and executives like Tony Xu (DoorDash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.
*   **Pre-IPO Program:** In development, with companies like Airbnb and Coinbase expected to share their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>.

This comprehensive support system means YC's founders often maintain a unique relationship with the organization, viewing YC as a "parent" rather than just an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. This deep trust allows founders to seek advice on urgent issues, even years after their batch, without the typical investor-founder dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>.

## The YC Community and Future Outlook

[[the_role_of_community_in_y_combinators_success | The core of YC's power lies in its community]], which operates almost like a university for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. The accelerator is the undergraduate program, and [[yc_continuity_and_growthstage_investing | Continuity]] is the graduate school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. This community-driven model provides peer support and knowledge transfer, with successful founders like Brian Chesky (Airbnb) and Tony Xu (DoorDash) regularly teaching new batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>.

Looking ahead, YC aims to:
*   **Scale Batch Sizes:** Despite an acceptance rate below 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>, YC's ambition is to grow its batch sizes to 1,000-2,000 companies in the future, if application volume of high-quality founders continues to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. This ensures more founders, particularly those from underrepresented regions, get their first opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.
*   **Deepen Global Support:** The remote world demonstrates that companies can emerge from anywhere, and YC is committed to scaling globally to support this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>.
*   **Continuity of Support:** YC's mission is to be a partner to companies for their entire lifecycle, even beyond IPO, as issues and the need for peer support persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.

The biggest risk for YC's future success, according to Anu Hariharan, is if the YC community, which is built on strong network effects and shared values, is disrupted or mismanaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>. However, by prioritizing the community's well-being and supporting founders' success, YC believes it can continue to achieve "incredible returns" and maintain its unique position in the venture ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

> [!INFO] YC's Differentiating Power
> YC's core power lies in its ability to assess founders and its extensive data and pattern recognition for identifying good founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>. They prioritize three key qualities:
> 1.  **Speed of Movement:** How fast founders ship and iterate, indicating their learning ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.
> 2.  **Hiring Acumen:** Their ability to hire effectively, particularly engineers and executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.
> 3.  **Clarity of Thought:** Their ability to articulate the long-term vision and scale of their company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.
> YC invests based on these "inputs" or "leading indicators" rather than solely on "outputs" or "trailing indicators" because these inputs influence company building and predict long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

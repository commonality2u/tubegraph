The landscape of media revenue models is undergoing significant shifts, with individual creators and small teams finding new ways to monetize their content through diverse strategies, including sponsorships and alternative business models.

## Evolution of Media Business Models

Traditionally, media outlets have relied on either advertising or subscription models. However, the rise of [[platform_business_models | platform business models]] and the "creator economy" has enabled new hybrid approaches and direct monetization paths for content creators.

Packy McCormick, founder of the "Not Boring" newsletter, exemplifies this shift. His journey showcases a deliberate evolution from initial concepts to a robust, multi-faceted revenue strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Direct-to-Audience Monetization

Initially, Packy's newsletter, `per my last email`, was a simple link roundup designed to fulfill a course assignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. It eventually evolved into a platform for essays and deeper dives into business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.

### Subscription Models

The [[subscription_business_model_in_internet_media | subscription business model]] was an early consideration for "Not Boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>. However, Packy consciously held off on implementing subscriptions, prioritizing audience growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. He noted that typical creator conversion rates to paid subscriptions are low, around 2-3%, unless content is significantly gated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

Successful subscription models, like those of Lenny Rachitsky or Mario Gabrial, often thrive when the audience is highly specific and companies are willing to pay for access to niche, valuable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>. This aligns with the historical model of publications like *The Wall Street Journal*, where businesses often cover subscription costs for their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Packy found it challenging to apply a subscription model due to the broad appeal of his content, which wasn't easily justifiable as a company expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.

### Sponsorships and Advertising

"Not Boring" pivoted to an advertising-led model when a potential sponsor, Chris from MarketHire, reached out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>. This inquiry prompted Packy to survey his audience, revealing a highly desirable demographic: 25-34 years old, high-income, in leadership positions, and well-educated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. This data allowed him to create a compelling sponsorship deck that quickly filled his advertising slots through the end of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>.

Packy pioneered a unique "sponsored deep dive" format, where companies pay him to write in-depth analyses of their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>. This model directly challenges traditional journalistic integrity, as the content creator is compensated by the subject of the article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. However, Packy addresses this by maintaining full transparency, explicitly stating when content is sponsored and outlining his selection criteria for sponsored companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.

He emphasizes that he only writes about companies he genuinely believes in and would consider investing in personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>. The success of this model relies on the sponsored content being as high-quality and informative as non-sponsored pieces, offering unique, behind-the-scenes insights into fast-growing startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:58">[01:12:58]</a>. This approach makes the sponsored posts valuable to readers, particularly founders and investors, who learn practical lessons from these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

## Challenges and Strategies in Monetization

The decision to pursue advertising was driven by Packy's "addictive personality" for audience growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. He believed that even ads could slow growth and opted to delay their introduction until he was sure of reader acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.

### Optimism vs. Cynicism

Packy's approach to media challenges the prevalent cynicism in tech journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. He maintains an "unabashedly optimistic" stance, believing in the positive impact of technology and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. This contrasts with traditional journalism's role of exposing corruption or highlighting flaws, which he argues is often misapplied to early-stage tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>.

His strategy is to be transparent about incentives and to write content that is both informative and entertaining, aiming to convert skeptics into thoughtful observers rather than just optimists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. The core principle is to "assume the audience is smart," which demands well-reasoned and useful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>.

### The Not Boring Flywheel

The success of "Not Boring" is attributed to a "flywheel" effect, where the content attracts a specific, valuable audience, which in turn attracts founders as sponsors, and enables investment opportunities, all feeding back into growing the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:34">[02:32:34]</a>. The content itself, aligned with the venture business, is considered the core magical element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:11">[02:34:11]</a>.

Packy recognizes the challenges in [[challenges_and_strategies_in_advertising_and_monetization | maintaining growth]] and engagement. He avoids diluting the core content with excessive self-promotion or unrelated product sales, recognizing that his audience values the content above all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:29">[02:16:29]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Packy's model has demonstrated remarkable financial success, projecting over a million dollars in revenue in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:28">[01:37:28]</a>. This level of success, achieved by a single person, is enabled by [[platform_business_models | platforms]] like Substack (for publishing) and AngelList (for running a venture fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>. These platforms provide sophisticated infrastructure and support that traditionally required large teams, allowing for a "solo corporation" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:40">[02:11:40]</a>.

Despite the growth, Packy acknowledges the inherent trade-offs:
*   **Single point of failure:** The business is heavily reliant on his individual output; if he stops writing, the momentum would likely cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:41">[02:14:41]</a>.
*   **Limited scaling beyond content:** While he can scale his investment activities, expanding into other product lines or hiring writers would risk diluting the unique voice and core product that defines "Not Boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:59">[02:15:59]</a>.
*   **Risk of "getting greedy":** Maintaining success requires a disciplined approach, avoiding over-expansion or compromising content quality for short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>.

The future of "Not Boring" is not strictly planned but relies on emergent opportunities and continued focus on delivering high-quality, insightful content that helps readers understand the "very near future" of tech and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>.

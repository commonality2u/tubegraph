Costco is described as a "Disneyland of consumer value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, founded on the principle of offering extremely great value on high-quality products at the lowest possible prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Its success stems from roughly 50 clever innovations refined over the years that work together like an orchestra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, with nothing about the company being an accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## History and Influence

The true history of Costco traces back to Saul Price and his companies FedMart and Price Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Jim Sinegal, Costco's co-founder and CEO, stated he learned "everything" about retail from Saul Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Saul Price's philosophy, deeply influenced by his working-class upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, emphasized providing value to customers and fair treatment for employees. This ethos is central to Costco's enduring business model.

### Early Membership and Pricing Concepts

The concept of a membership club to pool buying power originated with Fedco, a non-profit cooperative for federal employees in Los Angeles in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Fedco charged a one-time $5 lifetime membership fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Saul Price adapted this, initially to skirt laws that allowed manufacturers to set minimum retail prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>, as membership clubs were not "open to the general public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

When Price Club launched, the original idea was to create warehouses specifically for other small businesses, envisioning them as members who would come to stock their own shelves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. Saul Price realized that by providing a valuable service (managing logistics and inventory for small businesses), they could charge real money for membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.

The "stroke of luck" for Price Club was an agreement with the San Diego City Credit Union, allowing its members to qualify for a "group membership" at slightly higher prices than business members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. This unlocked a "gusher of consumers" and initiated the powerful word-of-mouth growth that characterizes Costco today, where consumers tell other consumers about the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.

## The Role of Membership

Costco's membership model is a cornerstone of its financial strategy, generating approximately 70% of the company's operating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:19">[01:51:19]</a>.

*   **Financials:** The base membership fee is $60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. Membership revenue is nearly 100% margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:04">[01:51:04]</a>.
*   **Customer Selection:** Membership selects for wealthier customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>. The typical Costco consumer has about $125,000 annual household income and a four-year degree, significantly higher than the median U.S. income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>. This is paradoxical: Costco has the lowest prices but the wealthiest consumers among major retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>.
*   **Psychological Impact:** Paying an upfront fee encourages members to utilize their membership, driven by the "endowment effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>. This boosts traffic and sales volume.
*   **Loss Prevention:** Membership helps decrease shrinkage, as members are less likely to steal and want to retain their club privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>. Costco's unaccounted-for merchandise (shrinkage) is astonishingly low at 0.15% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.
*   **Renewal Rates:** The U.S. member renewal rate is incredibly high at 93% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:21">[01:57:21]</a>, which is higher than the monthly retention of most streaming services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:21">[01:58:21]</a>.

### Executive Membership

Introduced in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>, the Executive Membership costs an additional $60 (total $120) and offers 2% cashback on transactions, capped at $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:16">[01:54:16]</a>.

*   **Break-even:** The break-even point for the additional $60 fee is $3,000 in annual spending, which is close to the average household spend at Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.
*   **Refund Policy:** If a member does not earn back their Executive membership fee through cashback, Costco will refund the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:36">[01:55:36]</a>. This policy highlights Costco's commitment to delivering value and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.
*   **Impact:** Executive members represent 45% of paid members worldwide but account for 73% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:27">[01:56:27]</a>. They also renew at a higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:55">[01:56:55]</a>, contributing to a "triple play membership" when combined with the Costco City Visa card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:09">[01:57:09]</a>.

## Pricing Philosophy

Costco's pricing philosophy is guided by rigid self-imposed rules designed to deliver extreme value to members.

*   **Margin Caps:** Costco maintains a strict cap on the margin it earns on products, typically not marking up anything more than 14% above supplier cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. Electronics are marked up even less (6-8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>. The only exception is the [[Costcos Supplier Relations and Vertical Integration | Kirkland Signature]] brand, with a maximum 15% markup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>. This contrasts sharply with department stores (100% markup) or even other discounters like Walmart (25% markup) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>.
*   **No Loss Leaders:** With the notable exception of the $1.50 hot dog and soda combo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, Costco generally does not sell items below cost to attract customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. This is a core tenet of Saul Price's philosophy, believing that loss leaders imply treating customers "like they're stupid" by marking up other goods to compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. Jim Sinegal famously stated that raising prices, even slightly, is "like heroin" â€“ an easy but ultimately detrimental path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:47">[01:23:47]</a>.
*   **Sharing Savings:** For every dollar Costco manages to reduce a supplier's price, 89 cents of that benefit is passed directly to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:03">[01:28:03]</a>. This reinforces member trust and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.
*   **Stable Pricing:** Costco has deliberately kept membership fees stable, with years between increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. The hot dog and soda combo has maintained its $1.50 price for over 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, a testament to this commitment, enforced by former CEO Jim Sinegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:11">[02:19:11]</a>.

## Business Model Implications

Costco's membership and pricing strategies are inextricably linked to its unique [[Costcos Business Model and Success | business model]].

*   **Negative Cash Conversion Cycle:** Costco operates on a negative cash conversion cycle, meaning it sells goods before it has to pay suppliers for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. This is achieved through rapid inventory turns (12.4 times per year, compared to Walmart's 8 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a> and standard net 30 payment terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. This effectively means suppliers finance Costco's inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>.
*   **Low SKU Count:** Costco maintains a very low SKU (stock keeping unit) count, currently around 3,800 unique items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>, significantly less than Walmart's 100,000-150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This low SKU count directly enables faster inventory turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>, simplifies logistics, and increases efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>.
*   **"Intelligent Loss of Sales":** Borrowing from Saul Price's concept, Costco intentionally limits product sizes to larger, bulk quantities (e.g., a 2.5-pound jar of nuts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. While this means losing sales from customers who only need smaller quantities, it simplifies operations and contributes to lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** The low SKU count and pallet-based sales system allow for significantly simpler logistics, with 92% of merchandise being "cross-docked" directly from supplier trucks to Costco trucks for delivery to warehouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:30">[01:47:30]</a>. This reduces labor needs (no unwrapping, no fancy shelving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a> and results in high revenue per employee ($730,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:18]</a> and per square foot ($1,800) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:13">[02:04:13]</a>.
*   **Revenue Growth:** Costco has consistently grown revenue around 10% for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Same-store sales grew by 14% last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>, and new stores perform better than older stores in their initial years, demonstrating continued learning and optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:36]</a>.
*   **"Treasure Hunt" Experience:** To encourage repeat visits, Costco dedicates about 25% of its SKUs to changing "treasure hunt" items that are unique and often one-time purchases, alongside its core staples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:26">[02:08:26]</a>.

## [[Costcos Supplier Relations and Vertical Integration | Supplier Relations and Vertical Integration]]

Costco's relationship with its suppliers is characterized by a "tough but fair" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>. Costco buyers deeply understand commodity prices and supplier costs, ensuring they get the lowest possible price without being predatory, knowing that Costco will not drastically mark up the goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>.

In instances where supplier concentration leads to inflated prices, Costco will vertically integrate to secure value for its members. A prime example is its chicken production: Costco sells 500 million chickens a year globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:09">[02:28:09]</a> (130 million are rotisserie chickens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:24">[02:28:24]</a>. To combat high prices from a concentrated supplier market, Costco built its own fully owned chicken processing facility in Nebraska, working with 150 local farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:30">[02:29:30]</a>. They also own and operate three optical grinding labs to make prescription eyeglasses, an industry known for inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:57">[02:52:57]</a>.

## Cultural Principles

Costco's code of ethics, inspired by Saul Price's FedMart principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>, prioritizes:
1.  Obey the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>
2.  Take care of members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>
3.  Take care of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a>
4.  Respect suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>

The ultimate goal is to reward shareholders by adhering to these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>. This long-term, principled approach to business is a key reason for its durability and high market valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:23">[02:21:23]</a>. Costco has never had a layoff, even after merging two nearly identical companies in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:29">[02:35:29]</a>.

## Defensibility and Future

Costco's [[Business Strategies and Pricing | business strategies and pricing]] model creates a powerful and defensible moat.

*   **Scale Economies Shared with Customers:** This is the core of Costco's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:31">[02:10:31]</a>. Its enormous volume allows it to secure the lowest prices from suppliers, and its low overhead means it can pass most of those savings to customers, leading to more members and greater volume in a virtuous cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:39">[02:10:39]</a>. Competitors, like Sam's Club, generate about half the revenue per store and are losing ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:29">[02:41:29]</a>.
*   **Counter-positioning to E-commerce:** While initially slow to adopt e-commerce, Costco has effectively counter-positioned itself against Amazon by focusing on a distinct value proposition: extremely low prices achievable only by physically coming to the warehouse and taking bulk items off the shelves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:31">[02:15:31]</a>. They have developed a Costco-flavored e-commerce strategy focusing on difficult-to-deliver "big and bulky" items (like sheds and refrigerators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:19">[02:45:19]</a>, and a partnership model (CostcoNext.com) that offers discounts on other websites for members without taking on additional logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:45">[02:47:45]</a>.
*   **[[International Expansion of Costco | International Expansion]]:** Costco has significant room for [[International Expansion of Costco | international expansion]], particularly in Asia, where stores show even higher member counts than in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:49">[02:43:49]</a>.
*   **Culture:** The company's consistent, long-term oriented culture, deeply ingrained in its leadership who often started in entry-level positions decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:52">[02:33:52]</a>, ensures the model's durability.

Costco exemplifies how "doing the right things" for customers, employees, and suppliers can lead to superior long-term financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>.

The discussion explores how traditional [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | investing]] principles, often associated with public markets, can be applied to the world of [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]]. While public markets offer abundant information and are highly liquid, making it difficult to gain a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, private markets like [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]] offer a different landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Reasons for Shifting to Venture Investing

One venture capitalist explains their shift to early-stage private market [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | investing]] due to several factors:
*   **Suitability of Skill Set** The nature of [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]] suits their skill set better, as it involves making "long-term qualitative judgments about the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This contrasts with the analysis required for public markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Probabilistic Endeavor** [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | Venture capital]] is a "much more [[probabilistic_nature_of_venture_capital | probabilistic]] endeavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The goal is to find "extremely high expected value investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> where, on average, money might be lost on individual bets, but a sufficient number of these bets can lead to great overall returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Personal Aptitude** The venture capitalist enjoys the process of hunting for and working with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, and likes "being an optimist" and thinking about a company's potential if it succeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This contrasts with a more conservative approach focused on avoiding "permanent Capital loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> or identifying undervalued "sucking" businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, which is not in their nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Applying Traditional Lenses to Venture

Applying "traditional [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | investing]] lenses" or "Buffett [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | investing]] lenses" to [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]] is considered "really interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This approach involves:
*   **Estimating Future Value and Probability** Thinking about "what this could be worth if it works" and "what's the potential probability that it works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Visualizing Future Business** To make these judgments, it's helpful to visualize what the business could look like in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This includes imagining:
    *   Future financials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   The "moats" (competitive advantages) of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
    *   The capital required to reach that future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   The likelihood of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   How the business might evolve after establishing itself in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Gaining a Knowledge Advantage

Unlike public markets where current company data is readily available to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, gaining a knowledge advantage in [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]] requires a different approach:
*   **Beyond Current Data** It's challenging to gain an advantage by simply "massaging the current data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Qualitative Judgments of the Future** The key lies in being better at making "qualitative judgments about the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a> and "figuring out what the future holds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This evolves from the traditional value [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | investing]] concept of "buying dollars for 50 cents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> to dealing with the qualitative and future-oriented aspects of [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Ultimately, successful [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | investing]], whether in public or private markets, involves gravitating towards strategies that align with one's individual skills and temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The concept of market efficiency, often discussed in relation to [[public_vs_private_market_investing | public markets]], suggests that available information is quickly incorporated into asset prices, making it difficult to gain an advantage through analysis of current data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, [[public_vs_private_market_investing | private markets]] present a different landscape, characterized by relative illiquidity and less information availability, which can create more opportunities for investors to find an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Venture Capital: A Unique Private Market
While [[public_vs_private_equity_and_venture_capital_strategies | venture capital]] operates in the private market, it is not necessarily "super inefficient" in the sense that everyone can transact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is difficult to access top-tier companies, and competition among investors for these opportunities is very fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Instead of capitalizing on inherent inefficiencies, the appeal of venture investing often lies in its alignment with specific investor skill sets and personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Skills and Approaches in Private Market Investing
Investing in [[public_vs_private_equity_and_venture_capital_strategies | venture capital]] demands a particular kind of analytical ability and outlook:
*   **Long-term Qualitative Judgments** The process often involves making long-term qualitative judgments about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This requires imagining what a business could look like 10 years into the future if successful, and identifying large discrepancies between current valuations and potential future worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This differs significantly from the analysis common in [[public_vs_private_market_investing | public markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Probabilistic Endeavor** [[investment_thesis_formation | Venture investing]] is a highly probabilistic undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Investors seek extremely high expected value investments, even though the average outcome for a single investment might be a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Success comes from making enough such bets and selectively adding more [[capital_efficient_growth_strategies | capital]] to the ones performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Beyond Permanent Capital Loss** Unlike traditional investing, which often emphasizes avoiding permanent capital loss, venture capital is not aligned with this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. A portfolio where every company yields a similar moderate return (e.g., 20%) is not the typical outcome or goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Qualitative & Future-Oriented Analysis** In a world where current company data is widely available, gaining an advantage requires either superior analysis of current data or, more crucially for venture, better qualitative judgments about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This involves evolving from traditional value investing principles of "buying dollars for 50 cents" to grappling with the challenging aspects of qualitative and future-oriented analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Applying Traditional Lenses to Venture
It can be insightful to apply traditional investing frameworks, like those used by Warren Buffett, to [[public_vs_private_equity_and_venture_capital_strategies | venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This involves visualizing what a business could be worth if it succeeds, assessing the probability of success, and projecting its future financial state, competitive moats, [[capital_efficient_growth_strategies | capital]] requirements, and potential evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Personal Fit in Investing
Ultimately, success in private markets, particularly in venture, often hinges on finding an approach that suits one's personal disposition and skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. An optimistic and futurist mindset, capable of imagining potential success, is highly valued in venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This contrasts with more conservative or quantitative approaches, like those suited for bond markets or distressed debt investing, which might focus on identifying undervalued assets or those that are less bad than perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Aligning with an investing style that matches one's innate characteristics is significantly easier than trying to force a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

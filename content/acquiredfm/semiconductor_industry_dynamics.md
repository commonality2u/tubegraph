The semiconductor industry is a complex and highly dynamic ecosystem, viewed by some investors as the "new oxygen" of the information age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>. This industry is characterized by rapid technological advancement, intense competition, and significant geopolitical considerations.

## Investment Philosophy in Semiconductors

NZS Capital, a public equities hedge fund, dedicates considerable research to the semiconductor sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Their investment philosophy is rooted in complexity theory, which suggests that the future cannot be precisely predicted due to complex adaptive systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Instead, they focus on "adaptability" and "resilience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>, seeking companies that create more value than they capture, fostering a "non-zero-sum" outcome for all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

Their portfolio strategy involves two main categories:
*   **Resilient Companies** These are generally more mature companies that can deliver durable, long-term growth, often for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Characteristics include:
    *   Mission criticality and switching costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
    *   [[scale_economies_in_semiconductor_industry | Scale economies]], where a single company can capture a vast majority of industry profits (e.g., TSMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
    *   Network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
    *   Emphasis on "non-zero-sumness" rather than traditional "moats" that might extract maximum economics from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Companies like [[impact_of_tsmc_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] are seen as resilient because they prioritize creating value for their customers, even if it means lower margins than some of their clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Optionality Plays** These are earlier-stage public companies with asymmetric upside potential, meaning they could experience significant growth in certain future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. They represent a more diversified, higher-risk, higher-reward portion of the portfolio, expecting failures but aiming for substantial wins from a few "multibaggers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

NZS Capital holds about a third of its portfolio in semiconductors, spanning the entire value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

## Key Players and Business Models

The semiconductor industry consists of various types of companies, each with distinct business models:

### Analog and Microcontroller Companies
These companies, like Texas Instruments (TI) and Microchip, focus on a broad catalog of parts, often used in everyday electronics like water meters and coffee makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
*   Their parts have long lifetimes (30-40 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
*   They boast high margins and durable growth, often showing greater operating margins than even software giants like Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>.
*   Their strength lies in the breadth of their catalog, which would take decades to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.
*   TI, for instance, strategically shifted focus away from leading-edge wireless business (like Nokia) to industrial and automotive markets, demonstrating adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>.

### Foundry Companies
These are pure-play manufacturers that fabricate chips designed by other companies.
*   **[[impact_of_tsmc_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]** is the dominant player, recognized for its neutral, pure-play foundry model. This model allows them to avoid competing with their customers, fostering trust and enabling customers to bet their entire company on TSMC's manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. This pure-play approach is seen as more resilient than vertically integrated models in the long run, especially given the difficulty of advancing Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. TSMC manufactures a quarter of the world's digital chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.
*   **Samsung** is a large and complex company with diverse operations, including consumer electronics and memory production (DRAM and NAND flash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>. They hold over half of the DRAM market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>. While they also have a significant foundry business (around 17% of the total foundry market), their model involves competing with their own customers, which can make it harder for customers to fully trust them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.

### Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs)
Companies like **Intel** design and manufacture their own chips.
*   Intel is a classic example of a vertically integrated company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. The challenge with this model is fighting battles on multiple fronts â€“ against foundries like TSMC on process technology, and against fabless designers like AMD (enabled by TSMC) in chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.
*   In periods of technological change, vertical integration can be beneficial for pushing product innovation (e.g., Tesla's approach to EVs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:11">[01:24:11]</a>. However, once technology stabilizes, horizontal models focused on efficiency tend to dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>.

### Fabless Semiconductor Companies
Companies like Nvidia design chips but outsource manufacturing to foundries like TSMC.
*   [[the_evolution_of_the_semiconductor_industry_and_the_rise_of_the_fabless_model | The rise of the fabless model]] has created some of the best business models in the world, with high gross margins (e.g., Nvidia with nearly 70% gross margins) and low cyclicality due to outsourcing manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:44">[01:34:44]</a>.

## Technological Dynamics

### Moore's Law
The industry continues to abide by the "spirit" of Moore's Law, with visibility for continued performance increases for the next 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   **EUV Lithography:** The implementation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) systems from ASML is crucial for shrinking transistors and packing more onto a chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. ASML believes EUV will enable doubling transistor count every 18 months for another 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>.
*   **New Transistor Architectures:** The transition to "gate-all-around" architectures at 2nm or 3nm nodes will continue to drive performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>.
*   **More than Moore:** Innovation is no longer solely about shrinking transistors.
    *   **Advanced Packaging and Chiplets:** Instead of gigantic single chips, performance gains are achieved by splitting functions into multiple smaller "chiplets" and stitching them together through advanced packaging techniques, creating a "system-level performance" focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>. This requires advancements from equipment providers like Lam Research and Applied Materials for deposition and etch steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:26">[01:35:26]</a>.
    *   **New Materials:** Alternative technologies like silicon carbide are emerging, used in electric vehicles and renewable energy due to their efficiency in high-voltage applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. Cree, for example, holds a significant market share in silicon carbide substrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.

### [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing_and_technology_optimization | Challenges in semiconductor manufacturing and technology optimization]]
Manufacturing a chip, especially logic chips, is incredibly complex, involving hundreds of steps and over a month in a fabrication plant (fab) operating 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. The complexity continues to increase with advancements in stacking layers and new materials.

## Ecosystem and Collaboration
The semiconductor industry is a "super organism," where a handful of key companies collectively drive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>. No single company can achieve all aspects of manufacturing due to the immense difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>.
*   **EDA (Electronic Design Automation) Software:** Companies like Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys form a duopoly in providing the critical software platforms for designing chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. Their role is to enable designers to create and emulate complex chip designs before costly fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.
*   **Lithography Equipment:** ASML is a near-monopoly in EUV lithography, a foundational technology for advanced chip manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. Their technology, which involves lasers from companies like Trumpf and highly uniform lenses from Zeiss, is incredibly intricate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>. The development of EUV involved a unique partnership where Intel, [[impact_of_tsmc_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]], and Samsung collectively invested in ASML to accelerate EUV development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>.
*   **Open Innovation Platforms:** [[impact_of_tsmc_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s "Open Innovation Platform" fosters collaboration across the industry, enabling partners to drive collective advancements. This "open approach" has largely superseded Intel's historical "closed system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>.
*   **IP Aggregation:** Companies like Apple, while designing their own chips, often aggregate "off-the-shelf IP blocks" from providers like [[transition_from_manufacturing_to_semiconductor_and_licensing_business | ARM]] (for chip architectures) and EDA companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>. This means designing a chip involves assembling many individual IP blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## [[geopolitical_risks_in_the_semiconductor_market | Geopolitical risks in the semiconductor market]]
The industry faces significant [[technological_and_geopolitical_issues_facing_tsmc_and_the_semiconductor_industry | technological and geopolitical issues facing TSMC and the semiconductor industry]], particularly concerning Taiwan, where [[impact_of_tsmc_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] is headquartered.
*   **Criticality of TSMC:** [[impact_of_tsmc_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] is considered one of the top five most important technology platforms globally, surpassing even companies like Apple in terms of its foundational role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. A disruption to [[impact_of_tsmc_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s operations due to geopolitical conflict (e.g., China seizing Taiwan) could set back the Western world's technological progress by 5 to 10 years, severely impacting the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>.
*   **"Semiconductor Sovereignty":** Nations are increasingly pushing for "semiconductor sovereignty" to mitigate supply chain risks, leading to efforts to build fabs in regions like Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** While [[geopolitical_risks_in_the_semiconductor_market | geopolitical risks in the semiconductor market]] are acknowledged, some investors view [[impact_of_tsmc_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] as too critical for major powers to allow its disruption in isolation. Furthermore, the Taiwan government still holds a significant stake in [[impact_of_tsmc_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]], making it a national champion unlikely to be acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

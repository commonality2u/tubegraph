The acquisition of Slack by Salesforce for $27.7 billion highlights significant themes in the technology market, particularly regarding [[power_and_competition_in_technology_markets | power and competition]] among tech giants, the strategic rationale for large-scale acquisitions, and the underlying influence of regulatory scrutiny. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>

## The Salesforce-Slack Acquisition

Salesforce acquired Slack for a total purchase price of $27.7 billion, valuing Slack at approximately $45.86 per share in cash and stock, with a majority of the payment in stock. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> This represented a 55% premium to Slack's trading price before the news of the acquisition leaked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> and an 85% premium to its stock price following its September earnings crash. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> Notably, this price per share was above Slack's first day of trading. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> The deal is considered the largest software acquisition since IBM bought Red Hat in 2018. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>

### Strategic Rationale for Salesforce

The acquisition positions Slack to remain independent, with its CEO, Stewart Butterfield, continuing to lead. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> Salesforce aims to integrate Slack deeply into its "Customer 360" platform, envisioning Slack as the "operating system for the new way to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. This means Slack could become the primary interface for Salesfoce's offerings, transforming communication within and between organizations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>

A key driver for Salesforce is leveraging Slack's growth among small, innovative organizations and startups, which then expand their usage as they grow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a> Slack's strong retention and expansion metrics could lead to significant future free cash flow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a> This acquisition provides Salesforce with a credible way to [[challenges_and_strategies_for_tech_giants_like_meta_and_amazon | access larger organizations]] that Slack has struggled to penetrate on its own. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>

## The Microsoft Factor: Competition and Antitrust

The primary challenge for Slack as an independent company has been the intense [[power_and_competition_in_technology_markets | competition]] from Microsoft Teams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a> Microsoft aggressively targeted Slack, publicly calling it out in charts and reports, a tactic considered unusual for a competitor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> This aggressive stance stems from Microsoft's view of Slack as a direct threat to its Office suite, particularly Outlook and email, which are core to Microsoft's cash cow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>

Microsoft Teams, while having significantly more users (around 100 million compared to Slack's 12 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, is often seen as more of a video conferencing competitor to Zoom than a direct chat competitor to Slack. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a> Teams' architecture is less flexible for large internal chat organizations, designed more as a hub for Microsoft's integrated services. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a> Microsoft's massive distribution power, with Teams often pre-installed on devices or bundled with Office 365, further amplified this perceived threat. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a> Slack has previously accused Microsoft of [[microsoft_antitrust_investigations_and_trials | leveraging its distribution advantage]] against it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>

### Antitrust Implications for Big Tech

The discussion raises questions about the role of [[microsoft_antitrust_investigations_and_trials | antitrust investigations]] in shaping the technology landscape. Salesforce itself previously filed an [[microsoft_antitrust_investigations_and_trials | antitrust suit against Microsoft]] to block the LinkedIn acquisition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

> [!QUOTE] "Salesforce is kind of the biggest acquirer that didn't get dragged up in front of congress and so is Salesforce in this really unique position where they can be this under the radar company that just picks off all the targets while everyone else is exposed to antitrust scrutiny." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>

Microsoft's past [[microsoft_antitrust_investigations_and_trials | antitrust trials]] have left it with internal processes to prevent future issues, influencing its acquisition strategy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a> This could mean that while other tech giants face intense scrutiny, Salesforce might have more room to acquire.

## Market Implications for Tech Acquisitions

### The Rise of "Best-of-Breed" Consolidation

The acquisition of Slack by Salesforce signals a potential shift from "best-of-breed" software purchases (where companies choose the best individual tool for each function) to a new form of consolidation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a> This "anti-Microsoft consolidation" creates an alternative to the fully integrated, "best-at-nothing" Microsoft ecosystem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a> Salesforce, by acquiring a platform like Slack, aims to become a credible centerpiece for a suite of best-of-breed applications, simplifying procurement and management for enterprises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>

This trend could benefit other "subscale" software companies (those not as large as Microsoft or Salesforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a> by providing them with a new distribution channel, potentially leading to more acquisitions in the future, such as Box or Dropbox. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>

### Slack's Valuation and Future Prospects

Despite strong financial metrics (49% year-over-year growth last quarter, 39% this quarter, positive free cash flow, and top-quartile SaaS metrics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>, Slack's stock price remained depressed due to the Microsoft Teams narrative. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a> The 55% premium offered by Salesforce was a compelling offer for a public company that hadn't seen its stock price consistently rise above its direct public offering price. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>

The slowdown in Slack's growth rate (from 49% to 39% year-over-year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>, despite tailwinds from remote work, may have also influenced the decision to sell. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>

### Missed Opportunities and Future Landscape

Other potential acquirers, like Google, were notably absent from the bidding process. Google, with its G Suite products (Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets), could have formed a powerful bundle with Slack, creating a new office suite to rival Microsoft. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a> Google's massive cash reserves would have easily financed such an acquisition without debt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>

Zoom, despite its high valuation and cheap currency for acquisitions, also did not acquire Slack. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:40">[01:10:40]</a> This is likely due to an underdeveloped corporate development function at Zoom and a strong focus on its core video platform. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>

The future of collaboration software may see new entrants like Discord, which offers more customizability and different business models, or emerging companies building "HQ-like" environments for remote work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a> The risk for Slack within Salesforce is that its product innovation might slow down, potentially leading startups to seek out these newer, more agile tools. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a> If Salesforce pushes Slack merely as a sales channel for its existing products, it could alienate Slack's existing user base, which values its independent nature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>

Ultimately, the acquisition represents a strategic move by Salesforce to broaden its ecosystem and compete with the comprehensive offerings of Microsoft, signaling a potential new era of consolidation in the enterprise software market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>

The integration of Web3 and [[development_and_impact_of_blockchain_technology | blockchain technology]] into the gaming industry has been met with both skepticism and optimism, evolving from early, often problematic, implementations to more thoughtfully designed approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>.

## Initial Skepticism and Early Attempts
Early Web3 gaming content faced significant skepticism, primarily because it often originated from "crypto people slumming in games" who lacked a deep understanding of game development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:59">[01:24:59]</a>. These early ventures often prioritized minting and launching NFTs and creating NFT marketplaces over delivering engaging gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>. The result was often "really crappy games that were really just an opportunity to... participate in an NFT Marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>.

## Evolution and Organic Use Cases
More recently, "game people" – seasoned developers and industry veterans – have begun to digest the technology and explore organic uses for it within games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>. This shift brings a "bit of hope" that good games will emerge that "don't seem like scams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>.

### Mechanical Differences and Enhancements
Mechanically, successful Web3 games are not radically different from traditional ones; "the best of them adhere very closely to the conventional models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>. Instead, the [[development_and_impact_of_blockchain_technology | crypto]] component is used to "improve or enhance an elder game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:53">[01:26:53]</a>.

For example, players who have been engaged in a free-to-play game for a long time might be "bored with just grinding on the underlying free-to-play progression mechanic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. [[development_and_impact_of_blockchain_technology | Web3 technologies]] can introduce a new sphere where a character can be minted as an NFT, providing "certain benefits in the underlying game" and "status that you in the status competition that you and the other like very Advanced players are are engaged in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. This can "enhance and enabled with the [[development_and_impact_of_blockchain_technology | web3]] technologies that actually are additive to the gameplay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>.

### Case Study: Eve Online
Eve Online, a long-running economic simulation game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>, is an example of a game integrating [[development_and_impact_of_blockchain_technology | crypto]] elements. It recently raised $40 million to develop a [[development_and_impact_of_blockchain_technology | crypto]]-enabled version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:42">[01:25:42]</a>. This new version will feature a token that functions like a "super currency" alongside an in-game currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>. This token is acquired through play and ownership, offering benefits that "don't necessarily make it competitively unbalanced" but "open up areas of gameplay that might be closed to you if you didn't own it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>.

The game's CEO uses an analogy: "Rome" for traditional game development (broken sewage, no paved roads) and "New York City" for Web3 development (right pipes, efficient infrastructure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>. Eve Online's core gameplay, with 80% focused on economic activities like mining, trade, and manufacturing, makes it a "perfect vehicle" for Web3 integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:24">[01:31:24]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

### "Pay-to-Win" vs. Competitive Integrity
A critical concern in Web3 gaming is avoiding "pay-to-win" mechanics, which can be the "death of a free-to-play game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:03">[01:28:03]</a>. While "pay-to-win" can offer short-term gains, it compromises competitive integrity, especially in games where social status or leaderboards are key components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>. If players can simply buy their way to the highest rank, it "would break" the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:25">[01:29:25]</a>.

### The "Speculator Problem"
One major challenge is the "Speculator problem," also known as the "Bitcoin Pizza problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>. When in-game tokens or NFTs increase significantly in value, users become incentivized to hoard them rather than use them, disrupting the game's economy which thrives on dynamism and transaction turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:09">[01:36:09]</a>. This also attracts speculators who are not playing the game, driving up prices and "pricing out your average user" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:55">[01:35:55]</a>. Finding solutions to this problem is crucial for the long-term viability of Web3 games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>.

### Company Incentives and Existing Models
There's a natural tension between the egalitarian notions of Web3 (e.g., player ownership of loot, peer-to-peer trading) and a gaming company's business model, which often relies on players buying goods directly from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:03">[01:32:03]</a>. However, companies can potentially "increase the size of the pie" by incentivizing greater trading volume and harvesting transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:35">[01:32:35]</a>. Roblox, though not Web3, demonstrates a successful peer-to-peer economy where the platform taxes transactions heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. Similarly, games like Counter-Strike have existing systems for virtual goods and secondary markets where Valve "double dipping and triple dipping on the content that they primarily issued" through transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a>.

The underlying idea of Web3 in games is to allow for a "more broad" incentive structure than traditional [[the_role_of_business_models_in_the_gaming_industry | user-generated content]] models, enabling communities to directly benefit economically and fostering greater engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>.

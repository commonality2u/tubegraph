Amazon has increasingly emphasized its machine learning capabilities, making it a significant pillar alongside compute and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Key Offerings and Strategy

*   **SageMaker** Amazon has specifically announced SageMaker as a core machine learning offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Dedicated ML Keynote** The importance of machine learning is underscored by Amazon breaking out a custom ML keynote at their events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **[[amazons_cloudhosted_ml_services | Cloud-Hosted ML Offerings]]** Amazon provides a wide range of [[amazons_cloudhosted_ml_services | cloud hosted ML offerings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
    *   They support TensorFlow, an open-source framework originally created by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
    *   Amazon offers its own container service (ECS) and an elastic Kubernetes service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While they serve customers who prefer Kubernetes, they aim to encourage the use of their custom ECS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Amazon's [[amazons_machine_learning_strategy | Machine Learning Strategy]]

Amazon's approach to machine learning is deeply tied to data proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Data Gravity
> The primary strategy for machine learning is that users will utilize the ML capabilities available where their data is stored, as running machine learning near the data is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Once a customer commits to Amazon as their storage vendor, migrating semi-trucks full of data into their data centers, they are unlikely to seek out other providers for ML services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Consequently, they will run their machine learning on AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_amazons_ml_capabilities_with_googles | Comparison of Amazon's ML Capabilities with Google's]]

Amazon's [[amazons_machine_learning_strategy | machine learning capabilities]] need to be good, but not necessarily superior to Google's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Even if Google is arguably better positioned to offer superior ML solutions, it becomes less relevant if customers are not storing their data with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This strategy ensures Amazon retains its customer base for ML services without necessarily needing to outcompete on every technical front, provided they do not fall "crazy behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

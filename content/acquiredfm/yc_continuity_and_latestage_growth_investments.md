Y Combinator (YC) is widely known for its accelerator business, which has produced companies like Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Brex, Modern Treasury, Vouch, and Vanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. However, YC also operates as one of the largest and most active late-stage growth investors in Silicon Valley, deploying billions into Series B, C, and D rounds for both YC alumni and non-alumni startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. This investment arm is known as YC Continuity, and it is led by Managing Partner Anu Hariharan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.

## Formation and Mission
YC Continuity was launched in July 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. The idea originated from YC founders who expressed a desire for YC to continue supporting them with investments and programs beyond the accelerator phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. At the time, growth-stage capital was less common, and the median time to IPO was around 11 years, creating a need for significant financing beyond early-stage rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

YC's overarching mission is to help more founders start companies and build enduring businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This mission shapes YC Continuity's approach, prioritizing founder success over fund returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. The relationship with founders is viewed more like that of a parent rather than just an investor, meaning founders often reach out to YC partners for urgent issues years after graduating, even if they haven't spoken in a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

## Operational Structure
YC Continuity functions as a multi-stage fund, focusing primarily on growth-stage investments (Series B and above) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. It is structured like other funds with external Limited Partners (LPs), primarily university endowments, aligning with YC's university-oriented mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. Initially, YC was self-funded by its founders, with seed capital being as low as $20,000 for the first batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. As costs for founders increased, external LPs were brought in to fill funding gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

The continuity fund is managed by a three-person investment committee, including Anu Hariharan, Ali Roghani, and one early-stage YC partner for tie-breaking votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>. Unlike the early-stage accelerator, which accepts companies with a "one yes is enough" policy from a group partner, continuity decisions are primarily made by its dedicated team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.

## Investment Strategy and Velocity
YC Continuity is not a high-velocity investor. Over seven years, it has made only 35 investments, which is less than one percent of the 3,500+ companies that have gone through YC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>. This low investment rate is partly due to the fund being a "startup within YC," refining its [[Venture capital and investing strategies | investment strategy]], and being "under-capitalized relative to the success of YC companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

The total combined market cap of all YC companies currently exceeds $600 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>. Despite the vast pool of potential investments, YC Continuity maintains a global reach, with investments in India, London, Latin America, and the Middle East, demonstrating its commitment to enabling entrepreneurship worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

### Focus on Founders (Inputs vs. Outputs)
YC Continuity's core strength lies in its ability to assess founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. With years of interaction and an "incredible amount of data and pattern recognition" from early-stage involvement, YC partners can identify qualities indicative of future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>. This differs from traditional [[Venture capital and investing strategies | venture capital and investing strategies]], where growth investors may only spend a few hours with a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

Anu Hariharan emphasizes three key qualities they look for in founders, especially at the growth stage:
1.  **Speed of Movement**: How fast a founder ships and iterates is the single biggest indicator of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. This allows for rapid learning from early decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>.
2.  **Hiring Ability**: The quality of hiring, particularly engineers and executives, is critical. Founders must be able to convince top talent to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.
3.  **Clarity of Thought**: Founders need to articulate a clear vision for how their company can become a multi-billion dollar enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.

This approach means investing based on "inputs" and "leading indicators" (founder qualities and processes) rather than solely on "outputs" or "trailing indicators" (current growth rates or margins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. The belief is that if these three qualities hold, strong metrics will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

## Programs and Support
YC Continuity runs extensive post-batch programming, offering founders significantly more support than in earlier YC batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. These programs include:
*   **Series A Program**: Helps founders prepare to raise their Series A round, covering pitch decks, term sheet negotiation, and investor identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.
*   **Post-A Program**: A six-week program that re-batches founders who have just raised their Series A, focusing on scaling challenges like forming recruiting teams and hiring engineers. Experienced YC founders teach these sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
*   **Growth Program**: An eight-week session specifically for CEOs to learn how to scale, covering topics like hiring executives, performance management, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. Noteworthy founders and executives like Tony Xu (DoorDash CEO) and his team (CFO, Head of Engineering) teach these sessions, sharing insights from their own scaling journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>.
*   **Pre-IPO Program**: Future plans include a pre-IPO program, with demand from companies like Airbnb and Coinbase to share their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>.

The YC community operates largely through WhatsApp, facilitating direct communication and peer support among the 8,500+ alumni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>. This community and the structured programs are designed to help founders learn from others' mistakes and best practices, accelerating their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.

## Comparison to Traditional Venture Capital
YC's model is often seen as an innovation in the [[Venture capital dynamics and firm structure | venture capital landscape]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>. While many VC firms discuss YC, sometimes negatively, YC's continued success suggests its model is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. YC is compared to a university, with the accelerator as an undergraduate program and Continuity as a graduate school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. This analogy highlights YC's mass production of investments, its community-first approach, and its support system for founders at various stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.

Unlike traditional venture funds, YC emphasizes that its mission is not about ownership percentages but about fostering enduring companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>. They avoid typical "tactics" in the closing process and prioritize the right decision for the company, even if it means not investing in a round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. YC also maintains an internal "ethics code" and community values, distinguishing it from many other investment firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

## Future Vision
Anu Hariharan envisions YC continuing to scale its support globally, recognizing that talent is everywhere and companies can emerge from any location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:34">[01:22:34]</a>. The goal is to grow batch sizes to potentially 1,000 or 2,000 companies in the future, as long as the quality of applications remains high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. This expansive vision for YC aims to be the lifelong partner for companies, supporting them from inception through IPO and beyond, helping founders navigate challenges at every stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>. The primary risk to YC's future success, however, is mismanagement of its powerful community and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.

## Early Applications in Finance

The foundational stages of high-speed trading technology and networked computing saw significant developments in the financial sector, influencing pioneers like Jeff Bezos.

### Phytel and Early Networked Computing

Upon graduating college in 1986, Jeff Bezos began his career at Phytel, a startup founded by Columbia computer science professors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Phytel developed very early network technology specifically for high-speed trading applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This technology was a precursor to today's co-located systems found in [[data_centers_and_cloud_computing | data centers]] alongside exchanges like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Bezos's two years at Phytel provided him with crucial experience in early networked computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. He gained not only a basic understanding of how these systems work but also practical insights into data like bits, bytes, packet counts, and the bandwidth capabilities of hardware, which allowed him to conceptualize potential applications buildable on such infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This experience was vital for a "then completely new discipline of finance" known as quantitative trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Quantitative Trading and D. E. Shaw & Co.

After his stint at Phytel, Bezos moved into banking in 1988, likely engaging in quantitative trading and finance given his technical background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This led him to D. E. Shaw & Co. in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

D. E. Shaw & Co. was founded in 1988 by David E. Shaw, a Stanford computer science PhD and former Columbia computer science professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The firm was modeled after Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies (RenTec), which famously achieved an average annual return of 66.1% from 1988 to 2018 through its core Medallion fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. While D. E. Shaw was primarily a quant hedge fund, it viewed itself as a group of "creative artisans" interested in investing in and starting new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The firm focused on recruiting "the smartest people in the world" across all disciplines, even those with no prior business or finance knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Within D. E. Shaw, Bezos became a senior vice president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. He led the development of the "third market business," an initiative to create an off-exchange trading market for retail investors to avoid high brokerage commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This concept is considered a predecessor to modern dark pools and [[sociotechnical_innovations_in_payment_systems | payment for order flow]] in the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Internet Opportunities and Early Web Ventures

Recognizing the nascent potential of the internet in the early 1990s (the Mosaic and Netscape days), David Shaw and Jeff Bezos, both having deep technical backgrounds and connections to the internet's early developers, became highly interested in exploring business opportunities online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Bezos himself had used the internet when it was command-prompt based with no graphical user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Shaw reassigned Bezos to work collaboratively on developing internet-based business plans within D. E. Shaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. One of their first projects was an online retail brokerage for financial trading, similar to e-Trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This venture likely evolved from the earlier third market business, as online platforms significantly enhanced its viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Welcome to season 11, episode one of Acquired, a podcast dedicated to exploring great technology companies and their playbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This episode delves into the history and development of Walmart, a company that ushered in a new era of American and global retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Many of the mental models and quotes often ascribed to Jeff Bezos were, in fact, the original thoughts of [[role_of_sam_walton_in_walmarts_success | Sam Walton]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. [[role_of_sam_walton_in_walmarts_success | Sam Walton]]'s greatest gift was his ability to digest, learn, adapt, test, and integrate new ideas from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. His autobiography, "Made In America," co-authored with John Huey, served as a blueprint for [[Amazons_early_history_and_founding | Jeff Bezos's]] thinking about [[Amazons_early_history_and_founding | Amazon]] in its early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

Walmart is currently the world's largest company by revenue, with nearly $600 billion in annual sales, with [[Amazons_early_history_and_founding | Amazon]] close behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It is also the world's largest employer, excluding public entities like governments, with nearly 2.3 million people employed globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The Walton family still controls just over 50% of the business, 60 years after its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. An astonishing 90% of America's population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart, with notable exceptions being San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## The Early Years of [[role_of_sam_walton_in_walmarts_success | Sam Walton]]

[[role_of_sam_walton_in_walmarts_success | Sam Walton]] was born in March 1918 in Kingfisher, Oklahoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. His father, Thomas Gibson Walton, transitioned from farming to farm financing, becoming a mortgage broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The Great Depression of the 1930s deeply impacted the Walton family, as his father had to foreclose on farms, often bringing young Sam and his brother Bud along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This experience instilled in Sam a frugal approach to money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

As a teenager, Sam took on various odd jobs, including selling magazine subscriptions, rabbits, and pigeons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. He also had a newspaper route for the Columbia Missourian, much like Warren Buffett, learning early lessons in sales and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. At 13, he became the youngest Eagle Scout in Missouri history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. He also quarterbacked his high school football team to an undefeated record, teaching him "to expect to win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Upon graduating from the University of Missouri (on an ROTC scholarship), Sam initially aimed for Wharton School of Finance but opted for a "real job" due to financial constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. He accepted an offer from JCPenney in Des Moines, Iowa, as a floor salesman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. His brief 18-month tenure at JCPenney was cut short by World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

## The Influence of Helen Robson and the Partnership Model

While depressed after failing a combat duty physical for the Army, Sam met Helen Robson in Claremore, Oklahoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. Helen's father, LS Robson, a wealthy businessman, significantly influenced Sam and Helen's financial approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Helen, with a college degree in finance, was instrumental in shaping the early business structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

In 1953, Sam and Helen established "Walton Enterprises," organizing their family businesses as a partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. This structure, which now owns 36% of Walmart, ensured that the family retained majority control and prevented corporate raiders from acquiring the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. Helen also vetoed Sam's initial ambition to buy a department store in St. Louis, insisting on no partnerships with non-family members and a preference for small-town living (under 10,000 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. This decision laid the foundation for Walmart's unique small-town strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

## The Newport, Arkansas, Store and the Rise of Discounting

Adhering to Helen's wishes, Sam found a Ben Franklin Variety Store franchise for sale in Newport, Arkansas, a town of about 7,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. He purchased it for $25,000 in 1945, using $5,000 of his savings and a $20,000 loan from Helen's father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. The store was struggling, with high rent and strong competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

To turn the store around, Sam began visiting competitor stores with a yellow legal pad, noting what worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. He realized that aggressive pricing, particularly on "loss leaders" like Health and Beauty Aids, could drive customers in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. He started directly sourcing goods from manufacturers, bypassing Butler Brothers (the franchisor) to get lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. This allowed him to "blow that stuff out of the store" at astonishingly low prices, generating volume even with thin margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. This strategy, "always low prices," became a cornerstone of Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

Within five years, the Newport store became the most profitable variety store in Arkansas and the largest by sales in the Midwest and South, generating $250,000 in sales and $30,000-$40,000 in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. However, the landlord, recognizing Sam's success, refused to renew the lease, forcing Sam to sell the business for $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. This painful experience taught Sam a crucial lesson about contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

## The Birth of Walmart and its Early Expansion

In 1950, Sam and Helen relocated to Bentonville, Arkansas, a town of 3,000 people with three existing variety stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. Sam purchased another Ben Franklin franchise, which had only $32,000 in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>. He then traveled to Minnesota to observe a "radical new concept": self-service variety stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. Impressed, he implemented it in his Bentonville store, renaming it "Walton's Five and Dime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>. This became only the third self-service variety store in the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. The store's first year sales jumped to $90,000, attracting customers from other towns, demonstrating the power of "shock value" and low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.

Sam's brother Bud also joined the Ben Franklin business in Missouri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>. Together, they explored new opportunities, like a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, Kansas City, which became a huge success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>. Sam realized the future of retail lay in larger format "family centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>. These stores would eventually achieve sales of $1-2 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

The concept of "discount stores" was relatively new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. Traditional retailers typically marked up goods by about 45%, leading to gross margins of 33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25">[01:11:25]</a>. Discounting, which included aggressive loss leaders and lower overall markups, was pioneered by stores like Ann and Hope in New England and FedMart, founded by Saul Price in Southern California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>. [[History of Costco and its business model | Saul Price]] would later found [[History of Costco and its business model | Price Club]], which eventually merged with [[Costcos_business_model_and_evolution | Costco]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>.

Sam, observing these pioneers, sought to apply their strategies. He approached Butler Brothers, proposing a partnership to embrace discounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. Butler Brothers declined, unwilling to cannibalize their existing high-margin franchise network, a classic example of the innovator's dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. This refusal proved to be their "death warrant," as Sam realized that these traditional stores were "dead anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

In 1962, [[role_of_sam_walton_in_walmarts_success | Sam Walton]] and Bud secured a site in Rogers, Arkansas, to open their first independent discount store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>. To save on signage costs, they settled on the name "Walmart," inspired by [[History of Costco and its business model | Saul Price's]] FedMart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. On July 2, 1962, the first Walmart opened, offering a "pretty unfamiliar store concept" but with "a lot less money" prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>. The store aimed to offer the lowest price on "literally everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>.

## Growth, Competition, and Technological Edge

Walmart's growth was initially overshadowed by rivals. In 1962, the same year Walmart opened, Woolworth launched Woolco, Dayton Hudson (Target's parent) launched Target, and S.S. Kresge launched Kmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>. Kmart, leveraging its existing distribution network, quickly expanded to 250 stores nationwide by 1967, with $800 million in sales, while Walmart was still a regional "gnat" with only 24 stores and $10 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>.

However, Kmart's existing [[Walmarts_logistics_and_operational_strategies | distribution network]] was tailored to the old model, not optimized for the lean, efficient operations required for discounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>. Walmart, starting from scratch, was "forced to learn to do" things differently due to being "under financed and under capitalized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:29">[01:32:29]</a>. They focused relentlessly on the lowest possible costs, maximizing cash flow and inventory turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>. This meant building their own [[Walmarts_logistics_and_operational_strategies | infrastructure]] and deeply understanding consumer desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:59">[01:33:59]</a>.

### Embracing Technology

Walmart, under Sam's guidance, became a technology company early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:51">[01:43:51]</a>. In 1966, Sam, then 48, attended an IBM seminar on using computing technology in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:54">[01:43:54]</a>. This willingness to embrace technology, even when not fully understanding it himself, was crucial for Walmart's scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

A significant investment was the $24 million proprietary satellite network, launched in 1987, to link all stores with two-way voice and data transmission and one-way video from Bentonville <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:19">[01:46:19]</a>. This allowed for rapid data collection and dissemination of learnings, enabling Sam to "virtually visit" stores and hold Saturday morning meetings remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>.

Walmart also revolutionized [[Walmarts_logistics_and_operational_strategies | logistics and operational strategies]] by inventing the modern "distribution center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:39">[01:48:39]</a>. Unlike traditional warehouses, these centers efficiently sorted and re-packaged bulk goods into customized daily orders for individual stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>. By building their own trucking lines, Walmart achieved unparalleled efficiency, allowing them to consistently outprice competitors like Kmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:47">[01:49:47]</a>.

## The Supercenter Era and Modern Challenges

By 1990, Walmart surpassed Sears to become the largest retailer in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:55">[01:51:55]</a>. Kmart, meanwhile, suffered from a "drunken acquisition spree" in the mid-80s, buying companies like Sports Authority, OfficeMax, and Borders, which they later sold off to raise cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:05">[01:53:05]</a>. Kmart filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and merged with Sears in 2004, but the combined entity still went bankrupt in 2018, unable to compete with Walmart's efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:07">[01:54:07]</a>.

In the late 1980s, Sam observed Carrefour's "hypermarkets" in Brazil, large stores combining a Walmart and a grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>. Although Sam's initial "Hypermart USA" concept (launched in the late 80s) was too big and failed, after his death in 1992, Walmart launched the more scaled-down "Supercenters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:55">[01:56:55]</a>. These Supercenters, offering groceries at prices typically 15% cheaper than comparable stores, became immensely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:39">[01:58:39]</a>. Walmart quickly became the largest grocer in America by the end of the 1990s, a position they still hold today with over 20% market share, double that of their closest competitor, Kroger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>.

### [[Challenges and adaptations by Walmart in the ecommerce age | Challenges and adaptations by Walmart in the ecommerce age]]

Walmart was slow to adapt to the internet in the 1990s and early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>. To bolster its e-commerce capabilities, Walmart acquired Kosmix in 2011 for $300 million, which became Walmart Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:36">[02:03:36]</a>. In 2016, they acquired jet.com for $3.3 billion, a move credited with jump-starting their e-commerce business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:36">[02:04:36]</a>.

Walmart's e-commerce strategy leverages its existing [[Walmarts_logistics_and_operational_strategies | distribution centers]] and physical stores, offering services like same-day grocery delivery and in-store pickup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:42">[02:06:42]</a>. They launched Walmart+, a Prime competitor, allowing customers to scan and checkout with their phones in-store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:24">[02:07:24]</a>. While Walmart's e-commerce is growing (37% pre-pandemic) and generated $75 billion in revenue, it remains a smaller and unprofitable segment compared to [[Amazons_early_history_and_founding | Amazon]]'s dominant online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:20">[02:06:20]</a>.

Walmart operates in 24 countries with 10,500 stores, serving 230 million customers weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18">[02:17:18]</a>. The Supercenter concept is now dominant, with only 368 of the original discount stores remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:38">[02:17:38]</a>. While Sam's Club, a membership-based warehouse club started in 1983, has been successful, it lags behind [[Costcos_business_model_and_evolution | Costco]], which has a lower gross profit margin (around 13% vs. Walmart's 24%) by pushing even harder on price by offering fewer in-store promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:50]</a>. Internationally, Walmart has seen mixed results, with successes in Mexico and Canada, but retreats from Germany and struggles with acquisitions like Asda in the UK and Flipkart in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:17">[02:22:17]</a>.

## [[Walmarts_impact_on_retail_and_communities | Walmart's Impact on Retail and Communities]]

Walmart's growth has slowed significantly, from 40-50% annual growth in the 1980s to around 3% since 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. Despite its immense scale, the company faces intense competition from [[Costcos_business_model_and_evolution | Costco]] (on price), [[Amazons_early_history_and_founding | Amazon]] (on convenience and e-commerce), traditional grocers, and dollar stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>.

From a community perspective, Walmart's impact is complex. On one hand, it saves consumers, especially middle and lower-income families, significant money on everyday purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>. It also provides a large number of jobs, although the quality of these jobs and their impact on local economies are debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:50">[02:48:50]</a>. The expansion of discounting inevitably led to the decline of local variety stores and small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

However, Walmart's pressure on suppliers to lower prices led to the offshoring of American manufacturing and a push for lower quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:05">[02:50:05]</a>. Walmart was a major contributor to the trend of manufacturing moving to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:13">[02:50:13]</a>. In terms of environmental impact, early practices were poor, but current management has embraced sustainability, becoming the largest U.S. commercial producer of solar power and investing in highly efficient trucking fleets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:08">[02:51:08]</a>. The company has also adjusted its gun sales policies, for instance, ceasing sales of assault rifles in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:03">[02:54:03]</a>. Walmart's vast scale means it often reflects broad societal issues and debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Playbook and Lessons Learned

1.  **Ruthless Learning from Competition**: Sam Walton famously advised, "Go in and check our competition... Don't look for the bad, look for the good. If you get one good idea, that's one more than you went into the store with, and we must try to incorporate it into our company." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:01">[02:38:01]</a> This relentless focus on stealing and integrating successful ideas from competitors, rather than criticizing their failures, was a core driver of Walmart's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:04">[02:39:04]</a>.
2.  **Identify and Ride the Wave**: Walmart successfully identified and rode the "discounting" wave, transforming it from a niche concept to the dominant retail model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:12">[02:40:12]</a>.
3.  **Eliminate Inefficiency**: To compete on price, Walmart was uncompromising in avoiding "buying anyone else's inefficiency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:14">[02:41:14]</a>. This meant contentious relationships with suppliers to drive down costs, ensuring the lowest possible prices for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:39">[02:41:39]</a>.
4.  **Build Your Own Infrastructure (When it's Your Core Competency)**: While generally, companies should focus on their core product, Walmart's success came from building its own highly efficient [[Walmarts_logistics_and_operational_strategies | logistics and operational strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:41">[02:44:41]</a>. This allowed them to control costs and deliver on their low-price promise in a way that existing players, with their legacy systems, could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:01">[02:45:01]</a>.

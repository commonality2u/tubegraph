Before his significant impact in e-commerce, Jeff Bezos's early career involved working with [[early_cellular_technology_and_development | nascent network technology]] for financial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Phytel: A Pioneer in Trading Infrastructure

After graduating from college in 1986, Jeff Bezos joined Phytel, a startup founded by computer science professors from Columbia University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The company was developing very [[the_evolution_and_centralization_of_the_internet | early network technology]] specifically for high-speed trading applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This technology served as a precursor to modern co-located data centers used by exchanges like NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Impact on Jeff Bezos's Career

Bezos worked at Phytel for two years, building infrastructure for the then-new discipline of [[transition_to_finance_and_quantitative_trading | quantitative trading]] and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This experience with [[early_cellular_technology_and_development | early networked computing]] was highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It provided him with:
*   A basic understanding of how network technology works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Insight into the practical implications of data flow, such as understanding bits and bytes, packet counts, and hardware bandwidth capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   An intuitive grasp of the types of applications that could be built using the infrastructure available at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

His background in computer science and work in network operations for early-stage [[transition_to_finance_and_quantitative_trading | quant finance]] positioned him well for future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Notably, David E. Shaw, founder of D. E. Shaw, was also a Columbia University computer science professor, likely familiar with the academics who founded Phytel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

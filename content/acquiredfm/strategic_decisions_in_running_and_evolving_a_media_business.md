The podcast "Acquired," hosted by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, focuses on analyzing great technology companies and the stories and playbooks behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The hosts frequently discuss the strategic decisions they make in running and evolving their own media business, which offers insights into [[strategic_vision_and_business_pivots_in_the_tech_industry | strategic vision and business pivots in the tech industry]] and [[business_growth_and_financial_strategies | business growth and financial strategies]].

## Evolution of the Show's Format

Over seven years, "Acquired" has undergone several iterations to refine its format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>. A key decision has been to move away from producing real-time "emergency pods" responding to breaking news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. While such rapid responses might seem appealing, the hosts prioritize creating evergreen content that "stands the test of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

Instead of focusing on current events, the show's strategic lens is "what can we add" to the existing conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This means they intentionally avoid covering topics like Twitter or FTX in real-time, as these subjects are already extensively covered by numerous tech journalists and analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The hosts believe their value lies in deep, retrospective analysis rather than immediate reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Strategic Trade-offs in Media Production

The hosts emphasize that strategy involves making "trade-offs," a concept popularized by Michael Porter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. They distinguish between operational efficiency (doing things better or cheaper) and true strategy (making deliberate choices that involve downsides but lean into upsides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

Key trade-offs made by "Acquired" include:
*   **Limited Content Release:** The show does not release new content every week, which can make it harder to consistently rank high in charts due to algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. However, this allows for extensive research, often involving "100 hours of research" per episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
*   **Long Episode Format:** Episodes are typically very long, which may deter some listeners but creates a highly engaged audience who appreciate the depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.
*   **No Network Expansion:** The hosts have consciously decided not to build a podcast network or bring on other hosts, prioritizing a "purity" to their brand and avoiding a "too hard pile" of additional management and production complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

## Live Events vs. Studio Episodes

In 2022, "Acquired" experimented with several live events, including an arena show, an international show in Portugal, and a live LP show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** These events provided unique opportunities for community engagement, allowing the hosts to meet listeners and deepen relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.
*   **Downsides:** Live shows are significantly more work, involve greater production challenges (e.g., sound quality, audience attention span), and often result in a "worse product" for the vast majority of listeners who consume it after the fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.

The hosts concluded that while live events offer special experiences and hidden value, they are not always "worth the squeeze" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. Their strategy for the future is to limit large live shows to perhaps "one episode per year" while continuing smaller, non-episode in-person engagements with partners and sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

## Audience Growth and Business Model

"Acquired" has consistently doubled its audience year over year, reaching over a quarter-million monthly active listeners by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. The Amazon episode was noted as a significant "step change" moment, bringing in many new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.

Despite this growth, the hosts acknowledge that podcasts are "inherently unshareable" compared to other media formats, making growth harder and slower unless there are external promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>. Growth often occurs through "infiltrating a network," such as a company's internal Slack or friend groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.

The show's [[business_models_in_the_digital_media_and_subscription_space | business model]] is built on a "very significant trade-off": they only do "six-month season-long sponsorships" with a highly selective approach to partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. This contrasts with mainstream creators who leverage platforms like YouTube for a living without engaging in business aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. "Acquired" maintains direct relationships with sponsors, often the CEOs of those companies, and even invests in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. For example, they invested a significant amount of capital, largely from their audience, into Vanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.

This unique approach means that revenue growth is not directly tied to audience size, unlike subscription models where a fixed percentage of consumers convert to paying subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. Instead, their [[leveraging_media_for_venture_capital_success | leveraging media for venture capital success]] strategy focuses on deepening engagement with a high-quality audience and sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.

Ultimately, "Acquired" views its audience and community as its "source of power and source of differentiation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:45">[02:21:45]</a>. The strategic decisions made reflect a desire to produce high-quality, impactful content and build deep relationships, even if it means sacrificing broader, faster growth.

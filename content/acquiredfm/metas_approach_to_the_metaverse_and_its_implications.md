Meta's strategic direction, particularly its focus on the metaverse, has been a subject of significant discussion and critique. While some aspects of [[Metas future vision and challenges | Meta's core business]] are seen as being on the right track, the metaverse initiative is largely viewed as a misstep that diverts resources and attention from its fundamental strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Critiques of Meta's Metaverse Strategy

According to analysis, the metaverse concept itself, as pursued by [[Metas approach to AI and AR development | Meta]], is considered a "bad idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This criticism stems from several points:

*   **Resource Allocation and Strategic Misalignment**: The metaverse initiative is seen as consuming significant resources and the attention of Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Meta, fundamentally a services and social network company, has a strategy that "works against that" by focusing on the metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Innovation Model**: There is a skepticism that "innovation is necessarily born of mass expenditures in large companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Instead of an organic period of experimentation and ecosystem building, Meta is attempting to "brute force" the metaverse into existence as a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Path to Success is Distant**: For Meta to succeed with the metaverse, it needs to sell headsets at a "sufficient scale and into friend networks" to enable social networking on the devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This "place of winning is even further away than I think people think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Disagreement**: The metaverse push has been opposed "from day one," specifically dating back to the acquisition of Oculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

## Impact and Market Perception

Despite the heavy investment and re-branding, the market is perceived as "overly down on Meta" partly because its branding of "Meta" was "too successful," overshadowing the continued strength of its core businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

However, the financial impact of metaverse spending is presented in context:
*   Meta still maintains a "Powerhouse" position in social media and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   The amount of money spent on the metaverse, "All Things Considered, not that much," especially when compared to its profitable core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Meta has reported a "five billion dollar profit a quarter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## Strategic Recommendations for Meta

Instead of focusing on the metaverse, a key recommendation for Meta's strategic direction is to "double down on what they are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This includes consolidating its core business rather than pursuing ventures like the metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Specifically, a recommendation was made to acquire Shopify to "close the loop on e-commerce and advertising," despite potential regulatory challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

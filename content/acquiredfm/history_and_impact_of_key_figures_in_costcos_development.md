The success and unique business model of [[history_of_costco_and_its_business_model | Costco]] are deeply rooted in the vision and principles of several key figures, particularly its spiritual founder, Saul Price, and its co-founder and long-time CEO, Jim Sinegal.

## Saul Price: The Retail Revolutionary
Solomon "Saul" Price, born in the Bronx, New York, in 1916, is considered by many to be one of the most influential American retail capitalists, often ranked alongside [[role_of_sam_walton_in_walmarts_success | Sam Walton]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. His approach to retail was shaped by his upbringing in the Jewish community of New York, where socialists were conservatives and communists were radicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. [[role_of_sam_walton_in_walmarts_success | Sam Walton]] himself acknowledged in his book *Made in America* that he "stole more ideas from Saul than anyone else in his business career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Saul Price's journey into retail began after he moved to San Diego and earned a law degree from USC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. As a lawyer, he advised various entrepreneurs, including those behind retail concepts like the Seven Seas Locker Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. He encountered FedCo, a non-profit membership club for federal employees, which pooled buying power for better prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. After FedCo declined to partner, Price and his associates launched FedMart in 1954 in San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

### Innovations with FedMart
FedMart became the first scaled, quasi-national discounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Price's key innovation was leveraging the membership club model to circumvent laws that prevented retailers from selling below manufacturers' minimum prices to the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This allowed FedMart to offer true "discounting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. In essence, Saul Price is credited with inventing both the discount store and, later, the wholesale club models that would define Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

Price also codified his retail management philosophies into "FedMart's Four Priority Order Principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>:
1.  Provide the best possible value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
2.  Pay good wages and provide good benefits to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.
3.  Maintain honest business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.
4.  Make money for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
These principles, particularly prioritizing value and employee welfare over short-term profits, became foundational for Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

The "intelligent loss of sales" was another principle developed by Price, meaning focusing on product sizes that offered the best value, even if it meant forgoing sales from customers needing smaller quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>.

### The Birth of Price Club
After being "fired" from FedMart by investor Hugo Mann, Saul Price, at 60 years old, was motivated to start anew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. With his son Robert Price, he conceived Price Club, a business-to-business (B2B) wholesale model based on the centralized warehousing operations he undervalued at FedMart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Price Club aimed to serve small businesses by offering goods directly from pallets in a warehouse, eliminating complex logistics and allowing for substantial savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This model allowed for charging a meaningful membership fee, recognizing the value provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.

The accidental inclusion of consumers through a deal with the San Diego City Credit Union led to explosive growth and a viral word-of-mouth channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>. This unforeseen success validated the consumer appetite for bulk buying at low prices, even in a no-frills warehouse environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

Saul Price also famously shared his playbook freely. He advised [[role_of_sam_walton_in_walmarts_success | Sam Walton]], leading to the creation of [[history_and_development_of_walmart | Sam's Club]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>, and Bernie Marcus, who went on to found Home Depot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. Price's philosophy of sharing "earned media" to drive customer engagement also influenced Costco, which historically does not advertise but generates buzz through unique offerings and community interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:07">[02:18:07]</a>.

Saul Price passed away in 2009 at 93, having dedicated his later life to philanthropy and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.

## Jim Sinegal: The Executor and Standard Bearer
Jim Sinegal began his career as a part-time bagger at FedMart in San Diego while a college student, working directly for Saul Price for 22 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. He eventually ran FedMart's entire distribution and centralized warehousing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. Sinegal's deep understanding of these operations was crucial, as this division later inspired Saul Price's creation of Price Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Jim Sinegal learned "absolutely everything" about retail from Saul Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

In 1983, Jim Sinegal co-founded Costco in Seattle with Jeffrey Brotman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The business plan was essentially a clone of Price Club, with Sinegal at the helm, known for his focus on scale and operational details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. Costco's rapid growth under Sinegal was astounding, hitting a billion dollars in revenue in less than three years, and three billion in less than six, a company first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

The eventual merger of Price Club and Costco in 1993 was a "reuniting" of the two entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>. Jim Sinegal was the clear choice to lead the combined company, Price/Costco, which later became simply Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>.

### Sinegal's Enduring Influence on Costco
Sinegal perpetuated Price's core principles, most notably the strict 14% maximum markup on products (15% for Kirkland Signature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. His famous retort regarding raising the price of a hot dog — "If you raise the price of the hot dog and drink combo, I will effing kill you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:11">[02:19:11]</a> — encapsulates this unwavering commitment to value and member trust. This disciplined approach ensures that members always perceive they are getting the best deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>.

Sinegal also deeply influenced Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. A 2001 coffee meeting between the two, chronicled by Brad Stone, led Bezos to reverse Amazon's policy of raising prices, declaring, "Amazon is a company that works hard to charge its customers less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:53">[01:29:53]</a>.

Sinegal's dedication to employees, evidenced by high wages, good benefits, and a culture of internal promotion, results in extremely low employee turnover (7% attrition rate for hourly workers after the first year, compared to 20% typical retail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:26">[01:32:26]</a>. This fosters loyalty and reduces "shrinkage" (unaccounted merchandise) to a remarkably low 0.15% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:01">[01:33:01]</a>.

Jim Sinegal retired as CEO in 2012, handing the reins to his long-time protégé, Craig Jelinek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:59">[02:18:59]</a>. Sinegal famously visited every Costco store annually, a practice continued by Jelinek, despite the hundreds of locations worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:48">[02:53:48]</a>.

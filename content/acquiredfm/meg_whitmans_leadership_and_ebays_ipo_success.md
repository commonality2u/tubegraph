## Meg Whitman's Appointment and Background

In the summer of 1997, Benchmark, with significant involvement from partner David Byrne, recruited [[Meg Whitman's leadership and eBay's IPO success | Meg Whitman]] to serve as eBay's CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Whitman came to eBay from Hasbro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, and prior to that, she was part of the Strategic Planning Group at Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. She also had experience at Bane, one of the top consulting firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Her leadership was integral to guiding the business, a narrative that resonated strongly with Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## eBay's Public Offering and Remarkable Returns

Just over a year after Benchmark's investment, eBay held its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in September 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. At the time of the IPO, Benchmark's initial $6.7 million investment was valued at $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

However, Benchmark was subject to a six-month lockup period, preventing them from distributing shares immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. By the time this lockup expired in the spring of 1999, the value of their stake had surged to over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This extraordinary return came from an initial $6.7 million investment from an $85 million fund, transforming into $4 billion in less than two years (approximately 18 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This alone represented a 47x return on their fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### Financial Details and Impact

It was reported that Benchmark had also structured equity-backed loans to founders Pierre Omidyar and Jeff Skoll, totaling $750,000 each, as an incentive to not accept an acquisition offer from Knight Ridder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. If these secondary transactions were incremental to the equity investment, it could have added another $1 billion to the total returns, making it an additional 12x on the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

Benchmark successfully distributed $4 billion in returns to its limited partners (LPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Despite the dot-com bubble's burst around 2000, which negatively impacted many investments from their first fund, eBay maintained its value, preventing a drastic decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. The fund's mark was reported as 92x, and even with potential adjustments, the actual distribution of $4 billion confirmed at least a 50x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

This unprecedented success resulted in an estimated $1.5 billion in "carry" dollars distributed amongst the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Famously, portions of this carry were even given to their assistants, making them multi-millionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The [[ebays_growth_and_initial_business_model | eBay]] deal set a precedent for future secondary transactions, demonstrating the value of allowing entrepreneurs to take some money off the table to incentivize them to continue growing the company rather than selling it early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

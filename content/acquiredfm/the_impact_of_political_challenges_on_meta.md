The political environment significantly impacted [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Meta]] (formerly [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook]]) after 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. Prior to this, public sentiment towards the company was largely positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>, but after the 2016 election, it became consistently negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

## Misdiagnosis of the Problem
[[Mark Zuckerberg]] believes that the company, and he personally, lacked sophistication in understanding the political environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. He admits to fundamentally misdiagnosing the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. One significant regret is that [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Meta]] accepted other people's assertions about what they were doing wrong or were responsible for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>, even when he doesn't believe they were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

There were indeed areas where [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Meta]] made mistakes and needed to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. However, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] distinguishes between identifying problems in good faith and people looking for someone to blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. He feels that taking responsibility for issues perceived as corporate crises, rather than political ones, led to further blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

> "I think we should have been firmer about and clearer about which of the things we actually felt like we had a part in and which ones we didn't." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>

## Long-Term Impact and Recovery
[[Mark Zuckerberg]] considers this political miscalculation a "20-year mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>, compared to the 1.5-year challenge of the HTML5 mobile app issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. Since 2016, [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Meta]] has been working diligently to fix issues and find the right approach to navigating the complex [[understanding_and_navigating_political_and_societal_impacts | political and societal impacts]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. He believes the company has now found its footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.

[[Mark Zuckerberg]] emphasizes the importance of pushing back harder on allegations about the tech industry or [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Meta]] that are not founded in fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. He anticipates it will take another decade for [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Meta]]'s brand to fully recover from this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>.

## Lessons Learned
[[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Meta]] has learned to support more academic research on these issues in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. This is crucial because when a company is accused of something, its own defense lacks credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. Independent academic research provides respected third-party evidence to debate the impact of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

The decision to rebrand from [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook]] to [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] coincided with these [[understanding_and_navigating_political_and_societal_impacts | political and societal impacts]] and brand challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. However, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] asserts the rebrand was not about "running away" from the [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook]] brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>, but rather "running towards" a future vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>, especially as the company doubled down on its investments in the metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. This period of reflection during COVID-19 also allowed [[Mark Zuckerberg]] to think deeply about [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Meta]]'s future direction amid the intense [[american_democracy_and_political_challenges | political challenges]] facing the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>.

Microsoft's journey from a small software partnership to a global technology titan is inextricably linked with its complex relationship with IBM. Initially a crucial partner in the burgeoning personal computer (PC) market, IBM's decisions ultimately paved the way for Microsoft's dominance.

### IBM's Early Dominance and Unbundling

For decades, IBM, often referred to as "the tech company," was the unchallenged giant of the computing industry [01:17:19]. Its mainframe computers, like the System 360, were sold as complete, bundled solutions encompassing hardware, operating systems, applications, and services [01:44:03]. However, facing [[antitrust_and_its_impact_on_microsoft | antitrust scrutiny]], IBM proactively unbundled its offerings in 1968, allowing customers to purchase hardware, software, and services separately [01:15:10]. While seemingly minor at the time, this decision inadvertently "cracked the door" for future software-only businesses like Microsoft [01:15:42].

### The Emergence of the Personal Computer

While IBM dominated the mainframe world, a new market for smaller, more accessible computers began to emerge. Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) introduced "mini computers" in the 1960s, which, though still large by modern standards, were significantly smaller and cheaper than mainframes, opening up new market segments for computing [01:42:04].

The true revolution, however, came with the development of the microprocessor. Intel's 8080 chip, priced under $200, made the concept of a "personal computer" feasible [03:35:36]. [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Bill Gates]], having gained early experience with computers at Lakeside School and through ventures like Traf-O-Data, quickly grasped the exponential potential of this technology, envisioning a future with "a computer on every desk in every home" [03:20:20].

### The IBM PC: A Game-Changing Partnership

In 1980, IBM, then the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $34 billion [03:40:40], decided to enter the exploding microcomputer market. Recognizing the need for speed and agility, IBM established a "Skunk Works" division in Boca Raton, Florida, for "Project Chess," tasked with developing the IBM PC using off-the-shelf components within a year [03:31:39].

IBM approached Microsoft, already known for its programming language interpreters, to license Basic, Cobol, and Fortran for their new PC [03:53:50]. Microsoft, however, did not have an operating system. [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Bill Gates]] initially referred IBM to Digital Research's Gary Kildall, who had developed the popular CP/M operating system for 8-bit machines [03:52:53]. A breakdown in negotiations between IBM and Kildall—whether due to a missed meeting, an unwillingness to sign NDAs, or royalty demands—led IBM to return to Microsoft [04:04:07].

Seizing the opportunity, Microsoft acquired QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), a 16-bit operating system developed by Tim Patterson of Seattle Computer Products, for a total of $75,000 [04:49:50]. Microsoft then licensed this adapted OS, which became known as [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | DOS]] (Disk Operating System), to IBM. The critical terms of this deal were:

*   Microsoft received a fixed payment of $430,000 for DOS and other language interpreters, with no ongoing royalties per copy sold [04:48:50].
*   Crucially, Microsoft **retained the rights** to own and license [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | DOS]] to other companies [04:50:10].

IBM, believing it would dominate the PC market just as it had mainframes, saw no issue with this, as it intended to win market share through its hardware [04:52:50]. This turned out to be "the greatest deal in at least computer industry history" [04:54:08].

### The Rise of the PC Clones and Microsoft's Dominance

The IBM PC, launched in August 1981, was an immediate success, selling 13,500 units in its first few months and half a million over the next two years [04:55:12]. However, IBM's use of off-the-shelf components and its inability to fully protect its BIOS made it easy for other companies to create "IBM PC clones" – cheaper, yet compatible, machines [04:57:07].

Companies like Compaq quickly emerged, legally reverse-engineering the IBM BIOS and offering similar hardware at lower prices [04:58:00]. As these clones flooded the market, Microsoft licensed [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | DOS]] to all of them, but this time on a per-machine-sold royalty basis, creating an immense revenue stream [05:00:50]. This strategy allowed Microsoft to "use IBM to generate demand for their software and then they used every other PC manufacturer to capture the value that all that demand created" [05:01:52]. Microsoft's revenue soared, from $25 million in 1982 to $98 million by fiscal 1984 [05:02:10].

### The OS/2 Partnership and Divorce

By the mid-1980s, IBM realized it was losing control of the PC ecosystem to the clones and Microsoft. To regain its proprietary edge and extend its influence into the evolving PC market, IBM partnered with Microsoft again to develop OS/2, a new, modern operating system intended to replace [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | DOS]] [05:07:05]. The agreement stipulated that OS/2 would be proprietary to IBM hardware, much like Apple's operating system was to its Macs [05:07:08].

Microsoft viewed this as "riding the bear" – maintaining a close alliance with the dominant IBM, despite the strategic disadvantages, to ensure they weren't crushed [05:07:23]. While committing resources to OS/2, Microsoft also maintained parallel development of its own graphical user interface (GUI) product, [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | Windows]], and continued its work on applications for Apple's Macintosh [05:07:39].

OS/2, however, proved to be a commercial failure upon its release in 1987 [05:08:25]. IBM's strategic decision to use the less powerful Intel 286 chip, fearing that more advanced PCs would cannibalize their mainframe business, further hampered OS/2's potential to support advanced GUIs and multitasking [05:12:00]. Meanwhile, the PC clone manufacturers, unconstrained by IBM's internal politics, adopted the more powerful Intel 386 chips, creating a market for a more capable operating system.

The "divorce" between IBM and Microsoft became official by the end of 1990, with IBM taking full control of OS/2 [05:15:08]. This freed Microsoft to fully pursue its own operating system vision.

### Windows' Ascendance and IBM's Decline in PCs

With the IBM partnership dissolved, Microsoft's "hedge" in [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | Windows]] became its primary strategy [05:15:08]. [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | Windows]] 3.0, released in 1990, was a significant success, quickly doubling the penetration of earlier Windows versions [05:18:45]. This version provided a true multitasking, graphical user interface running on top of [[development_and_impact_of_the_microsoft_windows_operating_system | DOS]], transforming the PC experience [05:19:50].

By 1992, Microsoft's revenue reached $2.8 billion, and in 1993, Microsoft surpassed IBM in market capitalization, symbolically inheriting the throne of the computing world [05:25:52]. This period also saw [[bill_gates_leadership_and_strategic_decisions_in_microsofts_growth | Bill Gates]] become the wealthiest person in America at age 31 [05:27:02].

The launch of [[history_of_microsoft_from_founding_through_windows_95 | Windows 95]] in August 1995 was a global phenomenon, selling millions of copies and cementing Windows as the dominant PC operating system [05:37:05]. This triumph was largely due to Microsoft's ability to market software like a consumer product, something IBM, focused on enterprise hardware, could never replicate.

While IBM's revenue would continue to grow for many years, even surpassing Microsoft's revenue until 2015 [05:43:35], its influence over the personal computing market had been irrevocably lost to Microsoft's software platform strategy. Microsoft's ability to leverage IBM's initial market creation, coupled with its own flexible licensing and focus on software, allowed it to outmaneuver the once-dominant incumbent and build an unparalleled empire. This also laid the groundwork for [[microsofts_enterprise_transformation | Microsoft's Enterprise Transformation]], where it would eventually directly compete with and surpass IBM in the lucrative business software market.

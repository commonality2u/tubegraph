Microsoft, founded 49 years ago (as of the podcast recording), is the company credited with creating the software business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While today it's a sprawling, global giant valued over $3 trillion, its early history is the story of a desktop software company that emerged before the internet, before it became a trusted partner to governments, and before personal computers were widely understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. It was spearheaded by a group of "ragtag geniuses in their 20s" pushing the boundaries of what was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Early Life of Bill Gates

[[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates III]], known as Trey, was born in Seattle, Washington, in 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. He was the second of three children to Bill and Mary Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

His father, Bill Gates Senior (the second), hailed from Bremerton, a Navy town near Seattle, where his family owned a furniture store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Bill Senior served in the Army during World War II, then attended the University of Washington on the GI Bill, becoming the first in his family to go to college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. He earned both an undergraduate and law degree in four years and became a prominent attorney in Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. He co-founded the firm Preston Gates and Ellis, now known as K&L Gates, one of the world's largest law firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Bill Gates Senior was also a significant figure in Seattle's entrepreneurial community, founding the Tech Alliance and being a notable angel investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

[[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]]' mother, Mary Maxwell, came from a family that founded National City Bank, and her father was a senior executive at First Interstate Bank (later part of Wells Fargo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Mary became a significant figure in Seattle's civic and business world, serving as president of the Seattle Junior League and joining numerous non-profit boards, including the Seattle Symphony, Chamber of Commerce, and Children's Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. She later joined corporate boards like First Interstate Bank, Cairo Television, and Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Mary also served on the Board of Regents for the University of Washington and the National United Way board, becoming "one of the most powerful business people in the Pacific Northwest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

Growing up, [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]]' household was unique, often hosting CEOs, senators, or governors for dinner, allowing young Bill to absorb business conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. At age 13, he pondered which company he would one day lead, indicating an early, strong business acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He was also "insanely competitive," disliking loss in any activity, whether sports, swimming, computers, or school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Contrary to a "computer nerd" image, he had a fierce competitive fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Lakeside School and Early Computing Exposure

At age 13, [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] enrolled in Lakeside School, a rigorous college preparatory middle and high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. It was here that he met Paul Allen, who would later become his co-founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

In 1968, the Lakeside Mother's Club raised money to buy a teletype and rent computer time from a DEC PDP-10 mainframe in downtown Seattle, owned by General Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This was a revolutionary opportunity, as computing at the time meant massive, room-sized machines, or human "computers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Access to shared computer time for a 13-year-old was extremely rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This early exposure provided [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen a "sneak peek into the future" of computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

The computing market in 1968 was almost entirely dominated by [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]], which built hardware (like the System/360), wrote software (operating systems and applications), and provided services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. However, [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] faced antitrust scrutiny and proactively unbundled its hardware, software, and services, selling them separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This action, though not immediately exploited, "cracked the door" for future companies like Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

A disruptive force to [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] at the time was Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), which made "mini computers" – machines the size of a closet, not a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. DEC's founder, Ken Olsen, focused on creating smaller, less powerful (but also less expensive) machines for new markets, like branch offices of large companies or universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. The PDP-1, DEC's first machine, was priced at $120,000, significantly less than [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] mainframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This was a classic "low-end disruption" playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Ken Olsen became a hero to [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

[[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] became hooked on programming after being exposed to the PDP-10 at Lakeside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. He quickly became one of the best programmers there, forming "The Lakeside Programmers Group" with three other kids, including Paul Allen, who was a high schooler at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. To use a computer in this era meant to be a programmer; there was no packaged software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. The group's goal was to make money using their rare programming skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

## First Ventures

The Lakeside Programmers Group was hired by a local startup, Computer Center Corporation (C-cubed), to find and document bugs in their time-sharing system, paying them in computer time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. There, they learned advanced languages like Fortran, Lisp, and machine language for PDPs, beyond the Basic they used at Lakeside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. Basic, though reasonably high-level, was a real and widely used programming language, akin to Python today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. At C-cubed, [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen were mentored by Steve Russell, who created "Space War," the first video game, and was an inspiration for [[Sonys_origins_and_history | Nolan Bushnell]]'s Atari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

Later, a Portland-based time-sharing company hired the group to write a payroll billing program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]], with his father's help, negotiated a royalty deal on the revenue the client made from the software, rather than just hourly pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. They earned at least $10,000, more than the average US household income at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

The next year, Paul Allen, while in college, teamed up with [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] on a new venture called Traf-O-Data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. Their idea was to use Intel's new microprocessor, the 8008, to build a machine that could process traffic data for municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This marked the progression from mainframes to mini computers, and now to "microprocessors" – the foundation of "microcomputers," or personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Before the 8008 was available, Paul Allen wrote an emulator program on the PDP-10 at Washington State to mimic its instruction set, allowing them to start coding without the physical chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

Traf-O-Data generated about $20,000 in revenue, but it gave [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen experience with microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] then had the idea for Microsoft: to write and sell a Basic interpreter for microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. This became the seed for Microsoft, which focused on selling language interpreters for new processors to enable familiar programming languages on new hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.

## The Dawn of Microprocessors and Microsoft's Vision

[[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen's vision for Microsoft was fueled by Paul's insight into semiconductor improvements. Paul suggested that "things would just keep getting better," a reference to Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] initially questioned this "exponential phenomena," but then realized it meant "computing as free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. This moment was the genesis of Microsoft's famous vision: "a computer on every desk in every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. This vision, seen as "whackadoo stuff" by many at the time, recognized the universal potential of computing due to exponential price decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

In 1973, [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] went to Harvard, initially aiming to be a world-class mathematician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. He later switched his major to applied math after realizing he wouldn't be the "smartest guy in the room" in theoretical math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. At Harvard, he befriended [[steve_ballmers_leadership_at_microsoft | Steve Ballmer]], who was highly analytical and even outscored Bill on a math competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.

In spring 1974, *Electronics* magazine announced Intel's 8080 chip, a 16-bit microprocessor. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] recognized it as the "heart of a real computer" priced under $200, realizing it meant "the end of big unwieldy machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. This cemented his commitment to computers as his life's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen anticipated major computer companies would jump on this opportunity, but they didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. Paul Allen dropped out of college and moved to Boston to be near Bill, and both worked as programmers at Honeywell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.

In December 1974, Paul Allen saw the *Popular Electronics* cover featuring the Altair 8800, the "world's first real honest-to-God commercially available for-sale microcomputer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. Paul rushed to Bill's dorm, proclaiming, "It's here!" to which Bill responded, "Oh my God, it's happening without us. We need to get on this right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. This moment marked the immediate founding impulse for Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.

## Founding Microsoft

Paul Allen and [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] called Ed Roberts, president of MITS, the Altair's manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. They falsely claimed to have a Basic interpreter ready for the 8080 Intel chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Roberts, who had received similar calls, challenged them to demonstrate a working version in Albuquerque, New Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

The Altair 8800 was the first mass-market personal computer, sold as a kit for $397 (about $300 in 2024 dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. It lacked a screen or keyboard, featuring only 16 lights and 16 switches for input/output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>. MITS, originally a model rocketry company, was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the Altair was a last-ditch effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. Roberts secured a volume deal with Intel for the 8080 chips at $75 apiece (down from a list price of $360), which was key to the Altair's low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. The Altair received 4,000 pre-orders in the first couple of months, generating $1.5 million in upfront cash, saving MITS and proving demand for home computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

Using the Harvard PDP-10, Paul Allen wrote an emulator for the 8080, and [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] wrote the Basic interpreter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. Paul flew to Albuquerque with the code on a tape, and on the plane, he hand-coded the bootloader in octal (not even assembly language) to load the interpreter into memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. The first attempt to run it failed, but the second worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. Both Paul and Roberts were astonished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

Paul Allen moved to Albuquerque and joined MITS as Vice President of Software (a department of one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>. As the Altair was about to ship with Basic, [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen set up a partnership called "Micro-Soft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. This name, suggested by Paul, combined "microcomputer" and "software," clarifying their focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. The partnership was founded on April 4, 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] was hardcore about sticking to software, sensing the potential for a business model where they wouldn't need to make hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.

Initially, [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] owned 60% of the partnership and Paul Allen 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. This later shifted to Bill at 64% and Paul at 36%, reflecting Bill's full-time commitment compared to Paul's part-time work at MITS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

## Early Challenges: Piracy and MITS Dispute

Microsoft signed an exclusive licensing arrangement with MITS, giving MITS the sole right to sublicense Basic to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. Microsoft would receive $30 per copy of Basic sold by MITS, plus 50% of sublicense revenue, but this was capped at a total of $180,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>. This was a great deal for MITS, as they likely wouldn't sublicense to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

A critical clause in the contract, likely inserted by [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] Senior, stated that MITS "must use its best efforts to license, promote, and commercialize the Basic broadly in the marketplace," with failure to do so allowing contract termination by Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.

In 1975, Microsoft's revenue was $16,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>. In 1976, it was $22,000, despite MITS selling thousands of Altair computers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. This discrepancy was due to widespread software piracy, a new phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. Piracy wasn't yet legally established, as the concept of protecting software (which was code, then machine code, then electrical signals) was unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] wrote an "Open Letter to Hobbyists" trying to guilt-trip people into not pirating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. It wasn't until 1980 that Congress amended copyright law to define and protect "computer programs" as copyrightable creative works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

This era marked the first time software was sold as a standalone product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] realized that the business model of selling software directly to consumers who could easily copy it was flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. The software should be bundled and included by the hardware OEM (like MITS) as part of the machine's purchase price to prevent piracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.

In 1977, the "1977 Trinity" of mass-market personal computers—the RadioShack TRS-80, the Commodore PET, and the Apple II—hit the market, fully assembled and with major distribution advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. These machines "ignited volume in the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.

Throughout 1976, Microsoft was approached by larger computing companies (NCR, GE, Control Data Systems) wanting to license Basic, with each deal potentially worth $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>. However, MITS dragged its feet, often turning down deals to avoid competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. Unbeknownst to [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen, Ed Roberts was preparing to sell MITS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. In May 1977, MITS was acquired by Pertec for $6.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

Pertec dismissed [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] as a mere "21-year-old kid," underestimating him greatly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. The dispute between MITS/Pertec and Microsoft went to arbitration in Albuquerque in fall 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. This period was the only time in Microsoft's history where cash was tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. Microsoft won the arbitration in November 1977, freeing them to license Basic to anyone on any terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

Microsoft immediately licensed Basic to the "Trinity" (Apple, Commodore, RadioShack/Tandy) and larger companies like GE and NCR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>. Notably, Apple licensed Microsoft Basic for $31,000 for eight years because their own Basic lacked floating-point numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] did not price-gouge; his strategy was to make Microsoft Basic the standard programming environment, creating a "positive spiral" where broad adoption would compound and make competitors obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.

## The IBM PC Partnership

Microsoft's revenue jumped to $381,000 in 1977 (mostly in the last month after the MITS dispute) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. In 1978, it hit $1.3 million with 13 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>. By 1979, revenue was $2.4 million, and with 25 employees, they decided to move to Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] chose Seattle over Silicon Valley to maintain secrecy and discourage employee turnover, and to leverage the University of Washington's computer science program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.

1980 was a pivotal year. Microsoft moved to Seattle, and [[steve_ballmers_leadership_at_microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>. Most significantly, Microsoft entered discussions with [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] for what would become the most important deal in technology history: the [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] PC partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.

[[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]], the "Sun, the Moon, the Stars of the computing industry," initially missed the 8-bit microcomputer wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>. However, with Intel's announcement of the 16-bit 8086 processor in late 1979, [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] saw the potential for personal computers to handle more serious business applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>.

To avoid repeating its past mistakes and to compete with "people who started in a garage" (like Apple), [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] created a secret "Skunk Works" division in Boca Raton, Florida, called Project Chess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. Their goal was to develop the [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] PC using off-the-shelf components and ship it within one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>.

[[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] approached Microsoft for programming languages like Basic, Cobol, and Fortran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>. At this time, Microsoft did not make operating systems; 8-bit OSes were largely custom-written glorified bootloaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a>. The dominant off-the-shelf OS was CP/M from Digital Research, run by Gary Kildall, whom [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] knew and often referred customers to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:10">[01:38:10]</a>.

[[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] asked Microsoft for an operating system, and [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]], in good faith, suggested they talk to Digital Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>. What transpired next is "one of if not the biggest business blunder in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>. [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] flew to Digital Research's office, but Gary Kildall reportedly was out flying his plane or missed the meeting due to another commitment, and his wife Dorothy refused to sign [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]]'s NDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>. Conflicting reports suggest the deal also blew up over licensing terms, with Kildall demanding significant royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>. Ultimately, [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] left believing Digital Research was not suitable for the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:37">[01:41:37]</a>.

[[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] returned to Microsoft, essentially throwing the problem back to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:54">[01:42:54]</a>. Microsoft then acquired the "Quick and Dirty 16-bit Operating System" (QDOS) from Seattle Computer Products (SCP) for $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>. QDOS was written by Tim Patterson because Digital Research had not delivered a 16-bit version of CP/M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>. This became DOS, later renamed MS-DOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>. Microsoft later paid SCP another $50,000 for full rights to 86-QDOS, allowing them to license it indefinitely to anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>. The total cost for DOS was $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. DOS, though initially a "quick and dirty" creation, would become the foundation for Windows operating systems until Windows 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:56">[01:46:56]</a>.

The [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]]-Microsoft deal was signed in November 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:42">[01:54:42]</a>. [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] paid Microsoft $430,000 in fixed fees for DOS and various 16-bit language interpreters, with no ongoing royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. This was a critical difference from Kildall's demands for royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. In exchange, Microsoft retained the rights to own and license DOS and its languages to anyone they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:10">[01:50:10]</a>.

[[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]]'s motivation was partly to appease antitrust concerns (by using an external vendor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>, but also because they assumed they would dominate the PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:20">[01:52:20]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]], however, bet that the market would see "a million hardware manufacturers" like with the Altair, all building to the same open specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:48">[01:52:48]</a>. [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] "failed to see the value of software" and unwittingly handed Microsoft the "point of integration for the whole ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:10">[01:53:10]</a>.

The [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] PC shipped in August 1981, just over a year after Project Chess began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:45">[01:54:45]</a>. It sold 13,500 units in the first few months and half a million over the next two years, becoming the market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>. At launch, customers could choose between DOS ($60), CP/M ($175), or Pascal ($450) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:54">[01:55:54]</a>. [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] pushed DOS heavily because it made a full 100% margin on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:43">[01:56:43]</a>.

To create some lock-in, [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]]'s DOS was called PC-DOS (different from MS-DOS licensed to others) and they had proprietary BIOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. However, the proprietary BIOS was "trivial" to reverse-engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:46">[01:57:46]</a>. Compaq, founded in 1982 by former Texas Instruments engineers, famously reverse-engineered the [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] BIOS using a "clean room" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:06">[01:58:06]</a>. This allowed Compaq to clone the [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] PC, selling it cheaper and becoming the fastest startup to hit $100 million and then $1 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:51">[01:59:51]</a>. By 1994, Compaq was the largest PC maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>.

This began the "race to the bottom" of PC hardware, with all value accruing to the software layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:56">[02:00:56]</a>. Microsoft licensed DOS to all these "clones" on a "per machine sold" basis, which, unlike the fixed-fee deal with [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]], became a "geyser of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:15">[02:01:15]</a>. Microsoft used [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] to generate demand for its software, and then used the clones to capture the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:52">[02:01:52]</a>.

Microsoft's revenue grew from $25 million in calendar year 1982 to $98 million in fiscal year 1984 (ending June 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:10">[02:02:10]</a>. This growth was driven by the clones, and because it was software, it had "100% essentially gross margin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:43">[02:02:43]</a>.

### Corporate Structure and IPO

In 1981, Microsoft reorganized from a partnership into a C corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Technology Venture Investors (TVI) invested $1 million for 5% of the company, valuing it at $20 million post-money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:15">[02:04:15]</a>. This seemed like a low valuation for a high-margin software company doing $17 million in revenue that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:27">[02:04:27]</a>. This was the only external dilution Microsoft would ever take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:04">[02:05:04]</a>.

[[steve_ballmers_leadership_at_microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] joined Microsoft in June 1980 as employee number 30, receiving 8.5% equity as the first person outside [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen to get equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:18">[01:35:18]</a>. This significant grant reflected Bill's view of Steve as a co-founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. The VC investment served as a "forcing function" to formalize the company's structure and create a board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>.

Microsoft went public in 1986, the same week they moved to their Redmond campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:37">[02:05:37]</a>. Their market cap at IPO was $750 million, despite $200 million in high-margin software revenue and 100% year-over-year growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:44">[02:05:44]</a>. This valuation indicated that the power of the software business model was not yet fully understood by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>. At IPO, [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] still owned 49% of the company, Paul Allen 28%, and [[steve_ballmers_leadership_at_microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] 7.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>.

## The Rise of Application Software

In the late 1970s, two significant 8-bit applications emerged for the Apple II: VisiCalc (the first spreadsheet) and WordStar (a word processor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:53">[02:13:53]</a>. These established the potential for business applications on personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:18">[02:14:18]</a>.

Microsoft started its "consumer products division" to create application software, initially focusing on spreadsheets and word processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:38">[02:14:38]</a>. They hired Charles Simonyi from Xerox PARC, who brought knowledge of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), object-oriented programming, and laser printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>. Simonyi led the teams that created Word and Multiplan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:26">[02:19:26]</a>. These early applications were DOS-based, using a command-line interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:44">[02:19:44]</a>.

Microsoft's Multiplan aimed for broad platform compatibility, but was overshadowed by Lotus 1-2-3, a spreadsheet developed exclusively for the [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:05">[02:20:05]</a>. Lotus 1-2-3 became the most successful software of its time; in some years in the late 1980s, Lotus even had more revenue and a higher valuation than Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:51">[02:20:51]</a>.

Microsoft learned from this defeat: "never leave yourself open to the next generation of Technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:57">[02:21:57]</a>. The applications team was given the freedom to target the "most cutting-edge platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>. This became the dawn of "horizontal software" companies, which could produce specialized tools better than any in-house developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>. This implied the need for a "killer app" on the *next* platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:05">[02:23:05]</a>.

## The Dawn of Windows

Recognizing the future of GUIs, Microsoft began developing its own graphical operating system, Windows, in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:11">[02:36:11]</a>. They announced it in November 1983, before the Macintosh shipped, much to Apple's displeasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:27">[02:36:27]</a>.

The [[microsofts_transition_to_graphical_user_interface | development of Windows]] was rocky, compounded by Paul Allen's Hodgkin's disease diagnosis in 1982-83, which led to his departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:52">[02:11:52]</a>. [[steve_ballmers_leadership_at_microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] was drafted to manage the final push for Windows 1.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Windows 1.0, released in November 1985, was "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:06">[02:42:06]</a>. It featured tiled (non-overlapping) windows that dynamically resized, making it difficult to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>. It was a "half-step" between command-line and a true GUI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:39">[02:38:39]</a>. Originally named "Interface Manager," it was not an operating system but a "graphical operating environment that runs on the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:40">[02:39:40]</a>. This would remain true until Windows 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:07">[02:40:07]</a>.

Microsoft and Apple had a licensing agreement, where Apple licensed its IP (much of which came from Xerox PARC) to Microsoft for Windows 1.0 and "all future versions of Windows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:01">[02:39:01]</a>. This agreement, made by John Sculley after Steve Jobs's initial ousting, would later haunt Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:31">[02:39:31]</a>.

While Windows was in development, Microsoft was deeply involved with Apple's Macintosh project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:26">[02:31:26]</a>. [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] saw the Mac project in 1981, three years before its 1984 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:41">[02:31:41]</a>. Microsoft developed applications for the Mac, most notably the first version of Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>. Excel was the world's first graphical spreadsheet program, giving it a crucial advantage over character-mode competitors like Lotus 1-2-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:39">[02:27:39]</a>. Apple recognized Excel and PageMaker as "killer apps" for the Mac, with Apple even matching Microsoft's marketing spend for Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:32">[02:29:32]</a>.

In 1985, Microsoft released "The Business Pack for Microsoft," the first bundled suite of applications (Word, File, Chart, Multiplan) for the Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:47">[02:32:47]</a>. By 1988-89, this evolved into Word, Excel, and PowerPoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:37">[02:33:37]</a>.

Throughout this period, Microsoft was "hedging a lot of bets," uncertain which strategy or platform would win out, but unified in their goal to "make great software for personal computers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:47">[02:34:47]</a>.

### The OS/2 Divergence

Microsoft's next major partnership with [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] was for OS/2, a new modern operating system intended to replace DOS and be proprietary to [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:24">[02:41:24]</a>. This was [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]]'s attempt to regain control of the PC ecosystem and prevent PCs from "creeping into the core Enterprise" mainframe workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:53">[02:46:53]</a>.

Microsoft, while still the "little brother" to [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]], committed to OS/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:05">[02:43:05]</a>. [[steve_ballmers_leadership_at_microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] described it as "riding the bear" – needing to stay with [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] because it was "the biggest, the most important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:40">[02:43:40]</a>. Internally, the company motto became: "the next big thing is OS/2 and [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:40">[02:44:40]</a>.

However, Microsoft simultaneously continued to develop Windows as a "hedge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:11">[02:44:11]</a>. [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]]'s choice of the Intel 286 chip for their PC AT (instead of the more powerful 386) was a strategic misstep, as the 286 was not powerful enough for a true GUI or multitasking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:12">[02:45:12]</a>. Compaq and other clones, not deterred, moved ahead with 386 machines that could run Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:03">[02:46:03]</a>. This was a "bet the company move" for Microsoft, encouraging Compaq to make 386 machines while outwardly supporting [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:21">[02:46:21]</a>.

When OS/2 finally launched in December 1987, it was not well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:23">[02:47:23]</a>. By fiscal year 1988, Microsoft's revenue hit $600 million, largely from DOS and applications, with little contribution from OS/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:02">[02:48:02]</a>. In 1988, Microsoft hired Mike Maples, [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]]'s director of software strategy, to lead Microsoft's application software, signaling the coming divorce from [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:17">[02:48:17]</a>.

The divorce became official by the end of 1990, with [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] taking full control of OS/2 development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:01">[03:07:01]</a>. This freed Microsoft to compete against [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] in the enterprise market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:16">[03:07:16]</a>.

## Windows 95 and Market Dominance

In 1990, Windows 3.0 was released, which was a significant improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:45">[02:48:45]</a>. It offered "adequate performance," accommodated existing DOS applications, and convinced users it "belong[ed] on a PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>. Windows 1.0 and 2.0 had only achieved 5% penetration, but Windows 3.0 doubled that in six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>.

Brad Silverberg, who led the Windows 3.1 team and later Windows 95, noted that the Windows team was a "ragtag group" of "misfits" who prioritized creativity over bureaucracy, like the Mac team at Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>. They "flew the rebel flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:19">[02:52:19]</a>. After the unexpected success of Windows 3.0, [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] and [[steve_ballmers_leadership_at_microsoft | Steve Ballmer]] decided to "bet on Windows" as the new primary strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>. This marked a turning point where Microsoft began to truly believe in itself as the dominant force, no longer needing to follow [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]]'s lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:03">[02:53:03]</a>.

In 1991, [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] outlined Microsoft's strategy: "Windows—one evolving architecture, a couple of implementations and an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:21">[03:13:21]</a>. This emphasized a single API for developers (Win32), two implementations (NT for enterprise and Windows 95 for consumer), and a vast ecosystem of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:05">[03:14:05]</a>.

By 1990, Microsoft was the first software company to pass $1 billion in revenue ($1.2 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:16">[03:14:16]</a>. In fiscal year 1992, they reached $2.8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:09">[03:15:09]</a>. In October 1992, [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] became the wealthiest person in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:20">[03:15:20]</a>. In January 1993, Microsoft passed [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:41">[03:15:41]</a>.

Windows 95 (codename "Chicago") aimed to be an OS for the "everyman," in contrast to the ambitious but never-shipped "Cairo" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:24">[03:16:24]</a>. The launch event on August 24, 1995, in Redmond was "glorious" and "insane," featuring Jay Leno co-hosting with [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:03">[03:18:03]</a>. Microsoft famously licensed "Start Me Up" by the Rolling Stones as its theme song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:14">[03:19:14]</a>. This launch was treated like a movie premiere or album release, attracting global media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Coca-Cola even consulted Microsoft on their marketing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:06">[03:21:06]</a>. Windows 95 sold a million copies in the first week and 7 million in the first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:46">[03:26:46]</a>.

Windows 95 was a "perfect product at the right time," riding the wave of internet hype, games, and multimedia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:50">[03:21:50]</a>. Its Start menu, though later cluttered, was a revolutionary feature that made computers accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Technically, Windows 95 largely moved beyond DOS, becoming a true 32-bit operating system with its own file system and rewritten components for better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:07">[03:28:07]</a>.

Brad Silverberg stated that Windows 95 "cemented Windows as the franchise product for Microsoft," which it remained for the next 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:21">[03:26:21]</a>. Microsoft's revenue soared from $5.9 billion in fiscal 1995 to $12 billion in fiscal 1997, making it the first software company to pass $10 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:56">[03:26:56]</a>.

## Playbook & Power

Microsoft's early history exemplifies several key business playbooks and powers:

*   **Capital Efficiency:** Microsoft achieved immense success with minimal external investment. They were bootstrapped, and even their $1 million VC round was taken to formalize the company, not for capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:03">[03:31:03]</a>. This allowed [[bill_gates_and_windows_development_history | Bill Gates]] to retain significant ownership and control, enabling agile strategic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:55">[03:32:55]</a>.
*   **Unique Market Conditions:** Microsoft benefited from the "freak laws of nature" in play: Moore's Law (exponential increase in computing power) and the "zero marginal cost of software" (infinite replicability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:51">[03:34:51]</a>. This created a "perfect storm" for building a highly defensible business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:09">[03:35:09]</a>.
*   **Massive Tailwind:** The secular growth of the personal computer market was unprecedented, growing at a 98% compound annual growth rate from 1975 to 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:12">[03:39:12]</a>.
*   **Hedging Bets:** Instead of having rigid conviction, Microsoft was willing to "hedge their bets" in a dynamic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:48">[03:40:48]</a>. They developed Windows as a Plan B while outwardly committing to OS/2, allowing them to quickly pivot when the market shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>.
*   **Talent Magnet:** Microsoft attracted top talent across engineering, sales, and marketing, fostering a culture where employees felt personally responsible for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   **OEM Scaling (Visa vs. Amex):** Unlike Apple's integrated hardware/software approach, Microsoft scaled by partnering with OEMs, distributing their software broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:31">[03:46:31]</a>. This "open network" model, like Visa's, allowed for incredibly efficient and rapid global distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:51">[03:46:51]</a>.
*   **Early International Expansion:** By going global early, Microsoft forced itself to build products that were "globally ready," amortizing development costs across a massive user base and ensuring their software became a global standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. They executed this through decentralized country managers and subsidiaries, tailoring marketing and sales locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:26">[03:49:26]</a>.
*   **Fast Follower (Copycatting):** Microsoft was famously not first to market with many applications but had "no shame" in copying good ideas and incorporating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:17">[03:50:17]</a>. They focused on making software easy to switch to, even incorporating competitors' keyboard shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:49">[03:50:49]</a>. Their strategy was to "start building the application, start building the product, get it into market, start learning, [and] be positioned that then when the paradigm shift comes, leap ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:17">[03:52:17]</a>.
*   **Software is Never Done:** Unlike competitors who might have viewed software as a finished product upon shipment, Microsoft embraced the continuous evolution of software through new versions and updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:47">[03:53:47]</a>.

In terms of Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers:

*   **Counter-Positioning:** Microsoft willingly embraced the microcomputer revolution and a software-only business model that disrupted [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]]'s bundled mainframe business, making money where [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] had baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:11">[03:56:11]</a>. They also actively enabled other companies to thrive on their platform, unlike [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:53">[03:56:53]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies:** With a massive installed base of users, Microsoft could amortize fixed development costs over vast numbers of copies, leading to extremely high margins and significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:46">[03:57:46]</a>.
*   **Switching Costs:** Once users and developers adopted Microsoft's operating systems and applications, the cost of switching to an alternative (lack of application compatibility, retraining) became prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:29">[03:58:29]</a>.
*   **Network Economies:** Microsoft fostered powerful multi-sided network effects: more users incentivized more developers to create applications, which in turn attracted more users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:50">[03:58:50]</a>. Additionally, the prevalence of Microsoft's document formats (e.g., Word, Excel) created strong network effects within and between organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:29">[03:59:29]</a>.

These combined factors explain how Microsoft built one of the most defensible and profitable businesses in history, ultimately inheriting the Earth from [[development_of_msdos_and_the_ibm_partnership | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:48">[02:55:48]</a>.

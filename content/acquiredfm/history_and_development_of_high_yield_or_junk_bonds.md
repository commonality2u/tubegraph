The concept of investing in [[high_yield_bonds | high yield bonds]], often referred to as "junk bonds," emerged from a period when such instruments were widely shunned by conventional investment institutions. The speaker's personal experience at Citibank's bond department, described as a "backwater" at the time, highlights the initial skepticism and lack of market participation in this asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Initial Market Perception and Barriers

Historically, most investment organizations had strict rules against purchasing bonds rated below A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Bonds with single B ratings were considered undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This widespread avoidance meant that there were often "no other bidders" for these bonds, which the speaker viewed as a positive indicator for potential investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

In the late 1970s, it was challenging to issue low-rated bonds, which were officially termed "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Large banks and underwriters typically avoided them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Moody's manual even defined a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This perception implied that such bonds were unsuitable for investment "regardless of price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, a stance that was later understood to be incorrect.

## Early Insights and Key Figures

Michael Milken, who graduated from Wharton in 1969, developed an early interest in low-rated bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His understanding was significantly influenced by a book called "Hickman," which analyzed bond performance from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The book revealed that, counterintuitively, bonds with lower ratings often yielded a higher *actual* rate of return (realized total return) rather than just a higher promised yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This held true despite periods of defaults and bankruptcies, including the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The excess yield offered by these bonds was more than sufficient to offset credit losses, serving as an "aha moment" for Milken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: The Life Insurance Analogy

The speaker articulates the core philosophy behind investing in [[high_yield_bonds | high yield bonds]] through an analogy with life insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. When questioned about investing in bonds known to default, the speaker likened it to life insurance companies insuring lives despite knowing all policyholders will eventually die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This parallel highlighted four key points:
1.  **Awareness of Risk**: Defaults are anticipated and do not come as a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
2.  **Analyzable Risk**: The risk can be assessed (like a doctor checking a policyholder's health) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
3.  **Diversifiable Risk**: Portfolios can be diversified to mitigate individual defaults, similar to how insurers avoid concentrating risk in specific high-risk groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
4.  **Compensated Risk**: Investors are well-paid to assume the risk, with yields offering a significant margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

This approach allowed for steady and safe profits from investing in what were considered the "worst public companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## [[contrast_between_high_yield_bonds_and_traditional_investments_like_the_nifty_50 | Contrast with Traditional Investments: The Nifty 50]]

The development of [[high_yield_bonds | high yield bonds]] as an investment strategy is often starkly contrasted with the prevailing investment trends of the late 1960s and early 1970s, specifically the "Nifty 50" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The Nifty 50 comprised companies believed to be the "best and fastest growing" in America, thought to be immune to negative events and for which "no price [was] too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

This represented a "polar opposite" to the perception of [[high_yield_bonds | high yield bonds]], for which "no price [was] low enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Both extreme stances were ultimately proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Investors who bought the Nifty 50 in 1969 and held for five years often lost "almost all their money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, primarily because these companies were priced excessively high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> (e.g., P/E ratios of 60-90 compared to an S&P average of 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Examples of Nifty 50 companies that underperformed due to high valuations or market disruption include IBM and Xerox, the latter of which "completely lost their market to imports" and needed a new business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Other examples like Simplicity Patterns, once part of the Nifty 50, faced significant decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The concept of disruption and the vulnerability of "moats" were not adequately considered for these seemingly infallible companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. In contrast, [[high_yield_bonds | high yield bonds]], though riskier by traditional metrics, offered returns that often outweighed their inherent credit losses, proving the importance of price in investment decisions.

When [[investment thesis formation | evaluating companies]] for [[investment strategies and stock picking in tech | investment]], two key skills are essential: understanding a company's future potential and assessing its current selling price relative to that potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Fundamental Valuation

All [[investment strategies and stock picking in tech | investments]] in equities are fundamentally valued based on the discounted value of their future cash flows "from here to Eternity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This valuation method, such as a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) formula, inherently requires making judgments about a company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Challenge of Disruption

Even companies that appear stalwart with immense consistency can be disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Case Study: Newspapers

Newspapers were once considered an "impregnable" industry with strong moats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Their perceived strengths included:
*   Lack of competition from neighboring towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Entrenched market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Low cost (e.g., 15 cents), ensuring continued purchases even in tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   Dominance in advertising due to high circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   A one-day shelf life, necessitating daily repurchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>

Despite these advantages, within 20 years, most companies in the newspaper industry were struggling for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Predicting such a drastic shift in [[changing_consumer_behavior_in_investment_evaluation | consumer behavior]] is incredibly difficult; those who forecasted the internet's impact on newspapers or TikTok's impact on Facebook/Instagram would have sounded "crazy" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Accelerating Pace of Change

The rate of technological adoption has significantly sped up over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This has reduced the durability of companies compared to past eras. In 1950, one could confidently predict that many businesses would remain consistent over a decade, a sentiment much harder to hold today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

The contemporary business environment demands continuous evolution and active management to protect moats and fend off competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Very few businesses can succeed today without diligent "minding of the ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Unlike the seemingly consistent backdrop of the world in the mid-20th century, everything changes rapidly today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Implications for Valuation and Growth

The increased uncertainty and lessened permanence of moats in the modern era raise questions about whether companies should be valued less, or if fewer future years of cash flows should be considered in their valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This evolving landscape is a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>:
*   On one hand, companies are more susceptible to disruption if not actively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   On the other hand, companies that possess and continually leverage competitive advantages to enter adjacent markets, launch new products, or expand geographically have unprecedented opportunities for value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The ability to address global markets through the internet, unlike the geographically limited newspaper industry, significantly amplifies this potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

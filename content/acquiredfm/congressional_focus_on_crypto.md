A significant portion of a representative's time on the House Financial Services Committee, approximately one-third, is dedicated to cryptocurrency issues over the course of a term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This focus places crypto among the top priorities for the committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Allocation of Time

While crypto commands a substantial amount of attention, other areas also require significant time and effort. These include:
*   **China Work:** The first year in Congress was largely spent on reforms related to international financial institutions like the World Bank and the IMF, which are perceived to be heavily influenced by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Capital Markets:** This involves work around events such as the GameStop [[Legislative Outcomes from the Meme Stock Mania | meme stock craze]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Other Key Financial Services Committee Focus Areas

### International Financial Institutions and China
Considerable effort has been directed towards reforming international financial institutions like the World Bank and the IMF, which are seen as largely "overrun by China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Capital Markets and the [[Legislative Outcomes from the Meme Stock Mania | Meme Stock Mania]]
The committee dedicated significant time to the [[Legislative Outcomes from the Meme Stock Mania | meme stock craze]] involving GameStop, conducting numerous hearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Monitoring online forums like Wall Street Bets was also part of this engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

#### Lack of Legislative Action
Despite extensive work, including four hearings, and national media attention, no meaningful legislation emerged from the [[Legislative Outcomes from the Meme Stock Mania | meme stock mania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The issue became a "political casualty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

#### Proposed Reforms
One key bipartisan proposal that failed to pass was a bill to shorten the settlement time for trades from two days to one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This change was intended to reduce overall risk in the system and could have potentially prevented actions like Robinhood's decision to halt trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Instead, a bill passed the House that incorporated various long-standing Democratic proposals, but it is not expected to advance in the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

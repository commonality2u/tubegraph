Congressman Anthony Gonzalez, a U.S. Representative from Ohio, is noted as one of the foremost members of Congress actively working on understanding and regulating Web3 and crypto within the House Financial Services Committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. He is part of a small group in Congress that actually uses and understands cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Personal Engagement with Crypto

Gonzalez's deeper engagement with crypto began around 2020, during the pandemic, as markets became volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. His "aha moment" occurred while listening to a podcast discussing Flamingo DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which made him realize the potentially impactful nature of this technology for society, capital markets, and access to financial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.

He dedicated several months to thoroughly understanding the space, learning about different Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains, various token types, and decentralized applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. To gain practical knowledge without ethical conflicts related to his committee role, he experimented with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) using a small amount of personal funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. He encountered issues like high gas fees that impacted his ability to interact with Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>. All funds used for this experimentation were later donated to the United Way, which accepts crypto donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. This hands-on experience greatly enhanced his understanding, allowing him to approach [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_cryptocurrency_regulatory_environment | legislation]] more thoughtfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

## Congressional Understanding and Time Spent on Crypto

Within Congress broadly, about 90% of members do not understand crypto beyond basic awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. Another 5% are on committees like Financial Services and are actively learning the basics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. The remaining 5%, including Gonzalez, have dedicated significant [[time_spent_on_crypto_in_congress | time]] to studying the topic and have formed clear views on the appropriate regulatory framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.

While there was an initial tendency for Republicans to be more supportive of crypto than Democrats, the primary divide in understanding and engagement is demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>. More senior members tend to be more skeptical, while younger members are more likely to engage with and understand the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>. The President's working group report and subsequent congressional hearings have jump-started broader engagement across Congress, leading to active debate on [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_cryptocurrency_regulatory_environment | legislation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>.

## Legislative Approach to Crypto Regulation

Congress is approaching a point where it can begin legislating on crypto, with stablecoins identified as the most straightforward starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. The preference is to take "bite-sized chunks" of regulation as understanding develops, rather than attempting a comprehensive, potentially overreaching, framework that could cause more problems than it solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.

### Philosophy of Regulation: "Do No Harm"

Gonzalez advocates for a "do no harm" approach to crypto regulation, similar to how the Clinton administration handled the early internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. This philosophy suggests allowing the technology to develop before imposing extensive regulations, recognizing that early attempts to control or "tamp down" nascent industries can stifle innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>. While acknowledging existing issues like tax evasion, he believes the response should not be to destroy the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.

A key goal of regulation is to provide clarity for innovators, allowing them to build transformative products without fear of inadvertently breaking laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. The current regulatory uncertainty has led companies like [[the_transition_from_alameda_research_to_ftx_as_a_crypto_trading_platform | FTX]], despite its founder's roots in Stanford, to establish operations outside the U.S., which is seen as detrimental to American economic interests and job creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

### Focus on Stablecoins

The collapse of Terra/Luna highlighted the risks in the stablecoin market and spurred congressional focus, especially on distinguishing between algorithmic and fiat-backed stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>. The legislative priority is to define and regulate "payment stablecoins," which are essentially fiat-backed stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.

Key regulatory questions for fiat-backed stablecoins include:
*   Reserve qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>
*   Auditing requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>
*   Attestation needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>
*   Consumer protection and redemption mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>

The goal is to ensure stability for users, particularly as stablecoins integrate into [[payment_and_financial_industry_trends | payment]] rails and are used for transactions like paying farmers or capital contributions for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. For algorithmic stablecoins, Gonzalez prefers a silent approach for now, as their classification (security, commodity, etc.) and appropriate regulatory response are less clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. He believes that if a policymaker doesn't fully understand something, they should generally remain silent on its regulation unless it is actively causing harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.

### Challenges in Legislation

The process of creating legislation is often frustrating and chaotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. Bills can be introduced, go through committee hearings, receive votes, pass one chamber (like the House), and then be sent to the other (Senate), where they often face obstacles like the filibuster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. Legislation can also become "christmas trees," where unrelated provisions are added, as seen with a crypto tax provision slipped into the infrastructure bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. This specific provision unintentionally sought to label any developer working in crypto as a "broker," which would have been detrimental to the industry by requiring them to provide tax information to the IRS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

The challenge of tax compliance in crypto is noted; without mandatory reporting from exchanges or DeFi platforms, users can easily break tax law by default, necessitating third-party software for tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. Despite these challenges, there is hope that future crypto legislation will be more thoughtful and incremental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

The 2016 election catalyzed a significant shift in the political landscape, leading to a period where Congressman Anthony Gonzalez felt he "stopped recognizing politics in our country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. This sense of a "pretty dangerous path politically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a> ultimately compelled him to run for Congress.

## The January 6th Capitol Attack and Impeachment Vote

The period following the 2020 election up to January 6th, 2021, created a "deeply uneasy feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a> for Gonzalez. He observed the rhetoric from the White House and how it was being reported, sensing a growing belief among constituents that the election was stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. He believed something terrible would happen if people thought the election was stolen, predicting a "real violent outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.

On the morning of January 6th, Gonzalez arrived early at the Capitol, noticing an unusual number of buses and a mall already packed with people, energy, and signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. He immediately felt that the situation would be "a lot worse than I even thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>. He had already pre-released his intention to certify the election results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.

While in the House chamber balcony, he observed Vice President Pence doing "the right thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a> by certifying the election. However, when Ted Cruz objected, Gonzalez felt "disgusted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. As he walked out of the chamber, he saw people breaching the Capitol from a window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a> and confirmed on Twitter that rioters had entered the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.

Upon returning to his office, the rioters were already in the House, and evacuation efforts were underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. Instructions were to turn off lights and remain silent if not in the bunker with other members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. Gonzalez changed into casual clothes, anticipating the need to "jump over them and sprint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a> if they broke into his office. He attempted to contact the White House to urge the former president to call off the events, but it took hours for him to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

Gonzalez considers the events of January 6th an "unforgivable assault on the country," led and inspired by the former president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. His view, aligning with the January 6th commission, is that the former president "kind of liked what was going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

This led to Gonzalez's decision to vote in favor of the second impeachment of the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>. While he had not supported the first impeachment (related to Ukraine, which he felt "didn't hit my bar for impeachable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>), he concluded that the actions on January 6th were "clearly impeachable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. He believed it was essential to send a message to "every future president forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a> that such actions, resulting in deaths and national embarrassment, would lead to impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. This was "the hardest decision I've ever had to make professionally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

Ultimately, Gonzalez decided not to seek re-election, a choice driven by his commitment to his oath to the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, and a desire to balance family life with the demands of public service, which often requires being on the road "north of 100 days a year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

## Broader Political Climate and Solutions

Gonzalez identifies the "great political battle of our time" as a fundamental question of whether one believes in American democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>. He observes a concerning trend on both sides of the political spectrum where, when things don't go their way, the immediate reaction is to "destroy and tear down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a> institutions, laws, or even the courts. He labels this attitude "poison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:29:48]</a>, arguing it emboldens adversaries like China and Russia and "cheapen[s] democracy and our leadership in the world globally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:43">[01:31:43]</a>.

He emphasizes the need to remember the "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:55">[01:29:55]</a> American idea and democracy, which placed the individual's sovereignty at the center and led to unprecedented wealth, prosperity, and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:19">[01:30:19]</a>.

To combat these challenges, Gonzalez advocates for several actions:
*   **Leadership and Risk-Taking**: Politicians must "do a much better job of fighting for things that are relevant for our people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:57">[01:31:57]</a>, ignore extreme voices, and "take the necessary political risks to bring us back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>.
*   **Voter Participation**: Democracy is a "participation sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:09">[01:32:09]</a>. He highlights that only about 20% of voters participate in primaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:38">[01:32:38]</a>, where most races are decided due to gerrymandering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. Increasing primary participation to 50% could "moderate" and "dramatically improve" politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:16">[01:33:16]</a>.
*   **Addressing [[frustrations_with_political_processes_in_washington | Frustrations with Political Processes in Washington]]**: He acknowledges the [[frustrations_with_political_processes_in_washington | frustration of Washington]] where legislation often becomes a "political casualty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. For example, efforts to shorten stock settlement times after the [[Legislative Outcomes from the Meme Stock Mania | meme stock mania]] failed due to partisan attachments to unrelated issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>. This highlights the difficulty in achieving meaningful legislative outcomes.

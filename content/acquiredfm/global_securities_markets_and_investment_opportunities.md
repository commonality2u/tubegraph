Charlie Munger offers a unique perspective on the [[evolution_of_markets_and_investment_strategies | global securities markets]] and [[investment_strategy_and_personal_suitability | investment opportunities]], drawing from nearly a century of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:03">[01:28:03]</a>.

### Investing vs. Gambling
Munger distinguishes between investing and gambling, noting that [[Venture capital and investing strategies | Warren Buffett]] always sought odds in his favor, preferring to be "the house" rather than the "punter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:10">[06:10:10]</a>. He views retail stock trading as akin to gambling, where individuals often trade without knowledge of the underlying companies, simply betting on price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:57">[06:30:57]</a>.

Munger suggests a tax on short-term gains with no offset for losses to discourage this type of activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:02">[06:40:02]</a>.

### Algorithmic Trading and Leverage
Discussions touched upon algorithmic trading, exemplified by Renaissance, which initially capitalized on simple patterns like "up up for two closing prices and down down were more common than down up or up down" due to human tendency to follow trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:34">[07:07:34]</a>. However, Munger points out that high returns in such strategies are often achieved through excessive "midday leverage," which he would not undertake if already wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:40">[08:02:40]</a>.

### The State of Modern Markets
Munger believes that investing today is "very hard" and has become "insane" compared to earlier times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:40">[13:01:40]</a>. He laments the absence of "low hanging fruit" or easily recognizable investment opportunities that existed in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.

> "The truth is it's very difficult to invest money well and I think it's all impossible to do time after time after time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:56">[20:39:56]</a>.

He notes that the world is "so far removed from the cigar butt era" where easy opportunities were plentiful, and now it's "the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11:32">[26:11:32]</a>. With "so much capital and so much competition," finding attractive opportunities has become "harder and harder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11:32">[26:11:32]</a>.

### Investment Opportunities
Despite the increased difficulty, Munger highlights a few types of opportunities and specific examples:

#### Few Great Businesses
Munger advises that investors will likely only find "maybe five, six times in a lifetime" an opportunity where they "know you're right and you have one that's really going to work wonderfully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:11">[12:44:11]</a>. When such an opportunity arises, one "should bet heavily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:31">[15:50:31]</a>.

To develop such conviction, he recommends "a lot of reading and thinking and visiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:06">[16:11:06]</a>.

#### The Costco Model and its Imitators
Munger points to Costco as an example of a company that "really did sell cheaper than anybody else in America" with "big efficient stores" and a "capital light business model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:27">[13:11:27]</a>. Its success was based on its strategy of making suppliers wait for payment until goods were sold, effectively having "no investment" in inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:19">[13:54:19]</a>.

He notes that others have successfully copied the Costco model:
*   **Home Depot:** [[Public Markets Innovations Including Direct Listings and SPACs | Bernie Marcus]] directly copied Costco's approach in home improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:04">[26:33:04]</a>.
*   **Floor & Decor:** This company is a "current imitator" in vinyl flooring, also running a "Costco model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:23">[27:00:23]</a>.

However, Munger warns that adding "miscellaneous stuff" to a focused model can "eventually kill you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:35">[27:12:35]</a>.

Walmart, despite its size, failed to adapt to Costco's model due to being "too wetted by the ideas they already had" and unwilling to pay for good locations in rich suburbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:40">[28:21:40]</a>.

#### Japanese Trading Houses
Munger described Berkshire's investment in Japanese trading houses as a "no-brainer" and like "God just opening a chest and just pouring money into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:03">[31:45:03]</a>. This was possible due to:
*   Extremely low interest rates in Japan (half a percent per year for 10 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>.
*   The trading companies being "really entrenched old companies" with cheap assets like copper mines and rubber plantations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:46">[31:05:46]</a>.
*   Ability to borrow for 10 years and buy stocks yielding 5% dividends, creating a "huge flow of cash with no investment no thought no anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a>.
*   Berkshire's unique creditworthiness, which allowed them to access these loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:13">[31:39:13]</a>.

#### Brand-Driven Companies
Munger values companies with strong brands that lead to pricing power. See's Candies, an early Berkshire acquisition, demonstrated that prices could be raised by 10% annually for 40 years without impacting volumes, simply increasing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:29">[34:10:29]</a>. The opportunity to acquire See's arose because the family needed liquidity for death taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:26:01">[35:26:01]</a>.

He contrasts this with Kraft Cheese, where price increases lead to "rebellion" from customers, versus Heinz Ketchup, where the particular flavor allows for pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:16:59">[37:16:59]</a>. He highlights that in some categories, like sauces in Korea, one company can control 95% of the market due to inimitable flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:04">[37:33:04]</a>.

He cites Hermes and LVMH as examples of the "very best" style companies that have built enduring brands over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:20:47">[33:20:47]</a>.

#### Technology Companies
Munger acknowledged that "everybody needs some significant participation in the 12 companies to do better than everybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:35">[41:12:35]</a>. Berkshire's investment in Apple was a "logical candidate" when it became "cheap" at around "10 times earnings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:12:20">[42:12:20]</a>. He emphasizes that success in asset classes like distressed debt, venture capital, or large public companies often "comes down to a few really good decisions with high conviction over an entire career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:29:43">[42:29:43]</a>.

#### China
Munger holds a positive view on China, stating:
*   The Chinese economy has "better future prospects over the next 20 years than almost any other big economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:04:15">[44:04:15]</a>.
*   Leading Chinese companies are "stronger and better than practically any other leading companies anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:16:04">[44:16:04]</a>.
*   These companies are "available at a cheaper price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:23:44">[44:23:44]</a>.
He is willing to have "some China risk" in his portfolio, around 18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:26:22">[44:26:22]</a>.

#### BYD (Build Your Dreams)
Munger is a "big fan" of BYD, a Chinese company making batteries and electric vehicles, viewing its founder as a "genius" and a "natural engineer" who can "actually make things with his hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:28:44">[56:28:44]</a>. He believes BYD is "better at actually making things" than [[Venture capital and investing strategies | Elon Musk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:19:16">[57:19:16]</a>.

Despite advising the founder not to enter the car business, BYD's investment became a "venture capital type play" that worked "fabulously well" after initial "huge mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:55:08">[55:55:08]</a>.

### Challenges in Investing
Munger highlights key challenges in the current investment landscape:
*   **Difficulty of Growth:** For a company like Costco, opening too many new stores annually is hard due to the need for new managers, politics, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:44:04">[50:44:04]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Focus:** Munger criticizes the culture where "everybody else has a standard way of doing things," often driven by "investment bankers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:04">[23:55:04]</a>.
*   **High Fees:** He argues that "2 and 20 or 3 and 30" fees charged by some private funds are excessive, especially when endowments are "not getting a good return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:21">[24:25:21]</a>. Endowments are beginning to push back, demanding reduced fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:23">[25:24:23]</a>.
*   **"Craziness in Venture Capital":** Munger views much of the [[Venture capital and investing strategies | venture capital]] industry as "very poorly done," with founders often "hate[ing] the venture capitalists" whom they perceive as only "taking care of themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:19">[21:04:19]</a>. He believes the industry attracts "the wrong people" who are "not great investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:26">[25:00:26]</a>.
*   **Market Overpricing:** Munger suggests that "damn near" everything in the world is "overpriced," which is "not only possible it's likely it's actually happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:27">[46:46:27]</a>.
*   **Intensified Competition:** The current system of "brutal competition" has made the process of finding successful investments "kind of unpleasant to the people who are losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:06:07">[47:06:07]</a>.

### Temperament and Long-Term View
Munger believes that investing "suits my nature" but he did not enjoy the "3 and 30 business" once he had enough money, preferring to "operate with my own money" for the freedom it offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:38:15">[38:38:15]</a>. He stresses the importance of having a good reputation and not "screwing your investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:35">[47:50:35]</a>.

> "The beauty of it is you only have to get rich once, you do not have to clap this mountain four times, you just have to do it once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:29:19">[48:29:19]</a>.

He emphasizes patience for great opportunities and recognizing when they arrive to "pounce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:38:18">[48:38:18]</a>. He also notes that industries like insurance require a "very patient person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:21">[40:01:21]</a>.

Regarding future predictability, Munger believes "most places have a lot of change and threat in their future" due to external factors like management changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

Acquired previously hosted a live show in San Francisco, featuring [[Mark Zuckerberg]] as a guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This event, described as "incredible" and a "life experience," took place in the iconic [[chase_center_live_show_event | Chase Center Arena]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It was conducted in partnership with [[JP Morgan Payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Event Details
The San Francisco show was the biggest and best way Acquired could imagine for a live event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. One of the hosts recalled losing the ability to speak for about a week after the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. More than 6,000 people attended the show at [[acquired_live_event_at_chase_center | Chase Center]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Impact and Future Plans
After the dust settled from the San Francisco event, a post-game discussion with the [[JP Morgan Payments | JP Morgan team]] led to the idea of hosting the next live show in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The stage used at [[acquired_live_event_at_chase_center | Chase Center]] was noted to be one-third the width of the stage planned for the subsequent Radio City Music Hall event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

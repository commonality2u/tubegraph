IKEA, the world's largest furniture retailer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:34">[02:34:34]</a>, operates under a complex and unusual corporate structure, primarily designed by its founder, [[Ingvar Kamprads early life and influence on IKEA | Ingvar Kamprad]], to ensure the company's long-term independence and continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:07">[01:41:07]</a>. This structure is famously opaque and involves two main "spheres" owned by separate foundations.

## Origins of the Structure

Ingvar Kamprad became deeply concerned about the future of IKEA in the 1970s, as the company was rapidly expanding globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:33">[01:38:33]</a>. His concerns stemmed from several factors:
*   **Succession and Family Dynamics** He wanted to prevent potential family squabbles among his three sons over control of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:46">[01:41:46]</a>.
*   **Political Independence** Kamprad aimed for IKEA to be "completely independent from anyone country's political fate," influenced by the volatile political history of Europe he had witnessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a>.
*   **Long-term Focus** He feared that if IKEA ever became a publicly traded company, it would be forced to prioritize short-term gains over long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:05">[01:42:05]</a>. Kamprad famously stated that "going public is a little like wetting your pants: it's warm and comfortable for a few minutes, but then after that..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:28">[01:42:28]</a>.
*   **Tax Avoidance** Sweden at the time had high and rising wealth and inheritance taxes, including an annual wealth tax of 2.5% on calculated wealth, which included a company's working capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>. To avoid these, Kamprad and his family immigrated to Denmark in 1973 and later settled in Switzerland in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Tax Laws Change
> In the mid-2000s, Sweden abolished both its wealth and inheritance taxes, leading Kamprad to move back to Sweden before his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>.

## The Two Spheres of IKEA

To achieve his goals, Kamprad, with the help of international lawyers, devised a complex structure involving two "spheres" or companies, ultimately owned by distinct foundations based in the Netherlands and Liechtenstein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a>.

### 1. The "Physical Sphere": Ingka Holdings (formerly Inca Holdings)
This entity is the largest franchisee of IKEA stores globally, operating 400 of the 476 IKEA stores worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>.
*   **Ownership**: Ingka Holdings is owned by the **Stitching Ingka Foundation**, a Netherlands-based charitable foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:58">[01:43:58]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: The foundation focuses on charitable causes like climate change and poverty, dispersing hundreds of millions of euros annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:46">[01:48:46]</a>.
*   **Operations**: Ingka is responsible for the actual operation of the retail stores, purchasing products from Inter IKEA Systems. It reinvests a significant portion of its net income back into the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Real Estate**: Ingka also manages Ingka Centres, large experience-oriented shopping centers built around IKEA stores, owning land and becoming landlords to other businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:27">[02:08:27]</a>. They strategically own as much real estate as possible around new stores to benefit from increased traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>.
*   **Investments**: Ingka has an "Ingka Investments" arm that invests in companies additive to its core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:21">[02:36:21]</a>.
*   **Financials**: Ingka holds approximately 25 billion euros in cash on hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:54">[02:37:54]</a>.

### 2. The "Mental Sphere": Inter IKEA Systems
This entity owns the IKEA brand, concept, and intellectual property, and is responsible for product development and supply chain management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:58">[02:27:58]</a>.
*   **Ownership**: Inter IKEA Systems is owned by the **Inter IKEA Foundation**, an Enterprise Foundation based in Liechtenstein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:03">[01:47:03]</a>. Liechtenstein was chosen for its favorable tax and treaty perspective for establishing such entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:05">[01:48:05]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this foundation is to "secure the independence and longevity of the Ikea concept and the financial reserves needed to ensure this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:26">[01:48:26]</a>. It is a self-owned entity with no individual beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a>.
*   **Operations**: Inter IKEA designs the furniture, works with manufacturers to produce it, and maintains the brand, including the famous IKEA catalog (until its discontinuation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. It licenses the IKEA brand and concept to store operators for a 3% royalty on gross sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>.
*   **Financials**: By 2011, this foundation reportedly held roughly 15 billion euros in assets (cash and marketable securities), not including the value of the company itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:30">[02:31:30]</a>. This cash pile has grown significantly, potentially reaching $50 billion or more, as approximately a billion euros in cash is sent to it annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:03">[02:32:03]</a>.

## Benefits of the Structure

This unique structure provides numerous advantages for IKEA:
*   **Tax Efficiency**: It minimizes taxes by leveraging deductible royalties and favorable tax regimes in the Netherlands and Liechtenstein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:03">[02:58:03]</a>.
*   **Protection from Takeovers**: As a foundation-owned entity, IKEA is protected from hostile takeovers and external shareholder pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:52">[02:57:52]</a>.
*   **Durability and Longevity**: The structure ensures long-term thinking and protects the company from internal family disputes or external political influences, which was a core concern for Kamprad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>.
*   **No Shareholder Pressure**: Without public shareholders to appease, IKEA can prioritize its mission of "creating a better everyday life for the many people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>, even if it means thinner profit margins or investments in areas like sustainability that might not yield immediate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Cash Reserves**: The massive cash piles within the foundations provide unparalleled financial stability, allowing IKEA to invest in strategic initiatives, weather economic downturns, and pursue long-term growth without needing external financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:29">[02:58:29]</a>. This contrasts sharply with companies that rely on venture capital strategies and firm architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:33">[02:40:33]</a> or other external funding sources.
*   **Strategic Working Capital Management**: Unlike most companies that aim to keep inventory low, IKEA is willing to build up excess inventories to secure favorable rates from manufacturers or ensure product availability, knowing their timeless products will eventually sell through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:01">[03:04:01]</a>. This also allows them to offer favorable payment terms to suppliers, fostering strong, long-term relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:38">[03:05:38]</a>.

> [!INFO] A True Anomaly
> IKEA is arguably a truly unique business. While companies like [[Amazons Financial Strategies and Business Model | Amazon]], [[Walmarts operational strategies and innovations | Walmart]], or [[Benchmark Venture Capital firms structure and strategy | Meta]] are "N of 1" in their respective industries, IKEA stands alone as a globally scaled, vertically integrated consumer goods brand sold at low margins to the many, owned by foundations and built almost entirely from reinvested cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:43">[03:10:43]</a>. It is a "Berkshire Hathaway of Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:16">[02:38:16]</a>, but with all organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:32">[02:39:32]</a>.

## Financial Implications

The 3% royalty paid by the store operators (Ingka) to Inter IKEA Systems significantly impacts Ingka's operating profit, potentially taking approximately half of its operating income given their thin margins (around 4-5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:48">[02:28:48]</a>. This structure, while complex, facilitates tax deductions and the strategic flow of capital to the foundations for long-term preservation and investment.

Despite its massive scale, with â‚¬47 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>, IKEA holds only a 5.7% market share in the astonishingly fragmented global furniture market, yet it remains by far the largest player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:14">[02:47:14]</a>. This further underscores its unique position, largely due to its scale economies, which make direct competition nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:55">[02:48:55]</a>.

The estimated total value of the IKEA business, including its cash piles in both foundations and the operating companies, is approaching $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:55">[02:39:55]</a>. This immense wealth was generated almost entirely by reinvesting the business's own cash flows over 81 years, without external equity or debt investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:59">[02:39:59]</a>.

## The Testament of a Furniture Dealer

In 1976, after establishing this corporate structure, Kamprad penned "The Testament of a Furniture Dealer," a document intended to serve as the company's "forever operating system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:31">[01:49:31]</a>. This manifesto, akin to [[Mark Zuckerbergs personal and leadership philosophies | Bezos's leadership principles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>, emphasized frugality, value for the many, continuous improvement, and a strong culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:10">[01:50:10]</a>. Kamprad himself lived by these principles, remaining deeply involved in the business until his death at age 91 in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:35">[01:55:35]</a>.

Vouch is an insurance company specifically designed for the technology industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>. It was founded by Travis Hedge, a fellow Ohio State alum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:38">[01:23:38]</a>. Acquired's hosts, Ben and David, are angel investors in Vouch, and Acquired itself is insured by Vouch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>. Anu Hariharan of Y Combinator's continuity fund is also an investor and board member in Vouch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>.

## Addressing Industry Challenges

The traditional insurance process for companies involved months of document exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. Obtaining business insurance through a traditional broker could take eight to twelve weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. Vouch addresses this by allowing startups to get insurance in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48">[01:25:48]</a>.

## Vouch's Business Model and Approach

Vouch protects technology companies against litigation, theft, and particularly cyber threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. The insurance industry typically consists of three layers:
*   **Distribution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>
*   **Underwriting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:43">[01:26:43]</a>
*   **Capacity** (the capital to pay claims) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>

Most companies in the insurance industry focus on just one of these layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>. Vouch, however, has taken a different approach:
*   **Initial Launch** Vouch began by getting licensed to sell insurance, similar to other companies, focusing on distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>.
*   **Tackling Underwriting** Vouch then moved to tackle the underwriting layer, creating policies from scratch specifically designed for technology companies, including innovative coverage like cap table coverage and cloud coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>.
*   **Securing Capacity** Vouch partnered with the world's largest reinsurance company for capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.

Recognizing that regulators and traditional insurance companies were initially hesitant about their novel policies, Vouch quickly aimed to own more of the value chain to control decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. They launched their own insurance company in the summer of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:24">[01:28:24]</a>. This infrastructure investment allows them to iterate on products in months and weeks, rather than a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>.

## Market Focus and Opportunities

Vouch's strategy involves going "super deep" by exclusively covering venture-backed technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>. While this means saying no to many typical main street businesses, this narrow focus allows them to become highly skilled at underwriting these specific companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>. The belief is that these focused companies will eventually grow into large enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.

As of May 4, 2022, Vouch covers 97% of U.S. venture activity across 32 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>. The company recently launched its services in Washington state, 12 hours prior to this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>. They also recently launched in Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

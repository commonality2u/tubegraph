Enterprise software systems have undergone significant transformations, moving from a siloed approach to a more integrated, cross-functional model, while also facing challenges related to complexity and the adoption of new technologies like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

## Historical Context: 20th Century Architectures

In the 20th century, corporations were primarily designed with functional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. These silos included departments such as finance, HR, sales, customer service, and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. Each of these departments heavily invested in silo-specific technology:
*   Finance systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>
*   HR systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>
*   Manufacturing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>
*   Sales systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>

These systems, often referred to as canonical systems of record (like CRM, ERP, and HRIS), became deeply entrenched within companies over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

## The iPhone Moment and Cross-Silo Operations

The "iPhone moment" in 2007, following the internet and the move to the cloud, ushered in an era of mobile business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. Companies began to work more and more across these traditional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. This shift revealed a significant challenge: the existing silo-specific systems could not properly execute business processes that spanned multiple departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. For example, processes like "order to cash," "procure to pay," and "hire to retire" require engagement across finance, sales, HR, and legal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

## Challenges of Legacy Systems

The entrenchment of older enterprise systems presents several challenges:
*   **Complexity and Cost** These systems are often viewed as "landmines" by executives due to their complexity and associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
*   **Multiple Instances** Many large companies have hundreds of different instances of these systems across various silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. For example, a government entity might have an HR system for every 1,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. This accumulation often results from new administrations or leaders implementing their preferred systems without removing old ones, leading to increasing "mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
*   **User Dissatisfaction** Users often complain about the usability of existing systems, leading to a lack of visibility into people's training, onboarding, or how they interact with the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.
*   **Adding AI Complexity** The integration of [[Software industry trends | agentic AI]] further complicates matters, as new agents are added on top of existing decades-old systems, requiring coordination across various departmental agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

## Service Now's Approach to Enterprise Software

Service Now aims to address these challenges by providing an [[Platform Business Models and Strategy | AI platform for business transformation]] that automates how work is done across traditional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Bill McDermott, CEO of Service Now, envisions the company as the "defining [[Software industry trends | enterprise software]] company of the 21st century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

The company's strategy involves:
*   **Automating Business Processes** Service Now focuses on automating business processes across all silos, effectively making existing siloed systems more relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.
*   **Platform Integration** Their platform resides "above" existing systems of record, cooperating and integrating with them to activate data within workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.
*   **AI as a Control Tower** Service Now positions itself as the "control tower" for work flow and data connection, utilizing [[Platform Business Models and Strategy | agentic AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>. Their Raptor DB connects structured and unstructured data, and they integrate with large language models and can run in any hyperscale cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Complexity** The goal is to provide "one clean paint of glass" for business transformation, integrating all procedures and flawlessly connecting with the top 700 systems of record globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.

This approach aims to bring simplicity to complex enterprise environments, which often requires a CEO-level sale due to the need for a broad vision across the entire enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. Even if initiated at a departmental level, Service Now's [[Platform Business Models and Strategy | platform]] can connect departmental solutions like a Lego set, leading to the same integrated outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

## Brand and Partnership in Enterprise Software

Unlike many [[Software industry trends | enterprise software]] companies, Service Now places a strong emphasis on brand building, similar to consumer companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. Bill McDermott believes a strong brand is a company's identity and DNA, helping to convey its purpose globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. Their tagline, "The world works with Service Now," reflects their ambition to be the global company that "makes things work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. This focus on brand includes partnerships with figures like Idris Elba, who serves as a brand ambassador and aligns with Service Now's values, even collaborating on philanthropic projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

Service Now also actively seeks to be a great partner with other major [[Enterprise Software Sales Strategies | enterprise software]] companies. Rather than viewing the market as a zero-sum game, they believe that collaboration benefits the customer and allows for reinvestment in [[Technology infrastructure evolution | technology]], lifting all boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. This partnership strategy aims to make existing systems more relevant and current by integrating with Service Now's platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.

## The Human Element in Enterprise Sales

Underlying these [[Business strategy and impact of technology | business strategy]] is a core philosophy rooted in people and relationships. Bill McDermott, who started his career in [[Enterprise Software Sales Strategies | enterprise sales]] at Xerox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, emphasizes "humility and empathy for people" as his "love and superpower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. This aligns with leaders like [[Challenges and transformations in Starbucks operations | Howard Schultz]] of Starbucks, who also shared a background in sales and a belief in people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

For any founder or entrepreneur looking to build a great [[Enterprise Software Sales Strategies | enterprise company]], the advice is to stop focusing solely on one's own technology and instead understand the customer's strategy, vision, and the "job" they are hiring the product to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. This requires thorough research before meetings and the ability to "read the room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. While the overall platform story is crucial, addressing specific, pressing customer issues (like a [[Security and compliance evolution in tech companies | regulatory challenge]]) with a relevant feature can also be vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

NZS Capital, a hedge fund with public equities investors Brenton Johns and John Bathgate, bases its [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | investment philosophy]] on complexity theory, which offers new frameworks for thinking about markets and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:03">[02:02:03]</a>. This approach emerged from the recognition that traditional [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | investing principles]] often fail because investors are frequently wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:27">[07:46:27]</a>.

## Foundations in Complexity Theory
The firm's entire investing philosophy is rooted in acknowledging past investment mistakes and seeking a better way to think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. The foundational texts for their approach were Eric Beinhacker's "The Origin of Wealth" and Mitch Waldrop's "Complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

Complexity theory, as explored by the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), posits that complex adaptive systems govern the world, making the future unfold unpredictably due to emergent behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. SFI began with physicists collaborating with economists, noting that economic theories and math often didn't work in the real world compared to the precision of hard sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. This led to focusing on biology, which proved more applicable to investing than traditional economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. Members of NZS Capital took courses at SFI to deepen their understanding of this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

### Core Principles: Resilience and Optionality
The firm's [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | investment strategy]] is built around two main concepts: [[resilience_and_optionality_in_investing | resilience and optionality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

1.  **Resilience**: This refers to companies that are durable, capable of long-term compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Characteristics**: Companies with high resilience are typically further along their S-curve, not necessarily seeking hyper-growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. Examples include Microsoft and TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. Key attributes include mission criticality, high switching costs, scale, and network effects, which allow a few companies to capture significant market economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Long-term Thinking**: Resilient companies prioritize longevity over short-term productivity, similar to how ant colonies optimize for survival, not just activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. This aligns with [[charlie_mungers_investment_philosophy | Warren Buffett]] and [[charlie_mungers_investment_philosophy | Charlie Munger's]] philosophy of "laziness bordering on sloth," where the goal is steady, long-term returns and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Anti-Moats**: NZS Capital is cautious about traditional "moats" that involve extracting maximum economics from customers through lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. Their firm name, NZS Capital, stands for "non-zero-sumness," indicating a preference for win-win outcomes for all stakeholders: employees, customers, society, and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>. This creates "consumer surplus" or "partner surplus" by leaving money on the table, fostering goodwill and buying duration for the company's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:19:00">[50:19:00]</a>. This approach of creating more value than you take aligns with Michael Porter's later thinking on "shared value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>.

2.  **Optionality**: This involves making broad, safe predictions about the future, accepting that specific outcomes are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Asymmetry**: Investments with optionality are highly asymmetric; they have a potentially large upside if the prediction comes true, but a limited downside if it doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:00">[26:41:00]</a>. This is common in [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Power Law Dynamics**: Optionality bets often aim to capture power law dynamics in markets, where a few winners take most of the economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>.

### Root Moats
Some companies possess both [[resilience_and_optionality_in_investing | resilience and optionality]], referred to as "root moats" (resilience with out-of-the-money optionality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:18:00">[28:18:00]</a>. Amazon, with its core retail business and the unforeseen emergence of AWS, is a classic example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>. Similarly, eBay with its marketplace business and the undervalued PayPal, serves as another instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>. This philosophy is also applicable to how successful CEOs run their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Construction
NZS Capital divides its portfolio into two parts:
*   **Resilience**: Concentrated with about 15 names, making up just over half the portfolio, with low turnover (around 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>. These are meant to be long-term, "set it and forget it" investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>.
*   **Optionality**: Distributed across about 40 names, making up just under half the portfolio, with a maximum position size of 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>. These positions turn over more quickly because it's acceptable to be wrong more often (e.g., 30% of the time), as long as the winners provide significant returns (slugging percentage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:43:00">[49:43:00]</a>.

When an optionality position matures and becomes more resilient, it may be trimmed or even moved to the resilient part of the portfolio, requiring buying more stock at potentially higher multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:48:00">[48:48:00]</a>.

## Distributions and Predictability
A core insight for NZS Capital is that the world, especially markets, is not normally distributed but rather governed by power laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:12:00">[32:12:00]</a>.
*   **Normal vs. Power Law**: Traditional [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | risk models]] are based on Gaussian (normal) distributions, which assume outcomes cluster around an average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:42:00">[32:42:00]</a>. However, reality is different; for example, earthquake frequency and intensity, or word frequency in a book, follow power laws, where a few large events or words dominate, and many small ones have a long tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.
*   **Ergodicity**: In a non-ergodic system (like investing or starting a business), the time average does not equal the ensemble average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:29:00">[35:29:00]</a>. A simple coin-flipping game with positive expected value per flip (win $50, lose $40) will, on average across many players, show a positive return. However, for an individual player, the time average leads to loss and bankruptcy, while a few become massive winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. This illustrates that most participants lose, while a few win disproportionately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[35:51:00]</a>. This means [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | standard deviation]] events are much more frequent than assumed by normal distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>.

### Conviction and Bias
The concept of "conviction" in investing is viewed as "overconfidence" and a source of bias due to sunk costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:54:00">[41:54:00]</a>. Instead of high conviction, investors should aim to maximize the probability of getting lucky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:00">[42:23:00]</a>. This means it's acceptable to invest in optionality positions without high conviction, as long as there's a probability of significant upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:00">[42:49:00]</a>.

To combat bias, NZS Capital fosters a culture where team members call out each other's biases, which is uncomfortable but essential for improving investment probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:59:00">[44:59:00]</a>. They also build a culture that expects failure in optionality bets, encouraging quick exits from losing positions rather than stringing along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:07:00">[46:07:00]</a>. Everything is documented, allowing them to check against original theses and "key leverage points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:42:00">[46:42:42]</a>.

## Growth and Duration
For NZS Capital, the "holy grail" is slow, long-term compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. Instead of hyper-growth, they seek "hyper durable" growth, exemplified by companies like Danaher or Texas Instruments that have compounded for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. Texas Instruments, with its decentralized culture and a CEO acting as a capital allocator, not just an operator, demonstrates this resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:07]</a>.

This preference for slower, durable growth is because the "real absolute dollar value of compounding shows up in the out years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>. Companies that generate less growth or profit in the short term by creating more value for partners and customers actually buy themselves longer duration of growth, which leads to greater overall value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:19:00">[50:19:00]</a>. This dynamic is a "negative feedback loop" – a natural governor on growth that ultimately benefits the company in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:24:00">[51:24:00]</a>.

## Research and [[learning_evolution_and_openmindedness_in_investing | Learning Evolution]]
NZS Capital's research process prioritizes unstructured time for connecting dots and generating insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:27:00">[54:27:00]</a>. They spend less time on typical investor conferences and more on industry trade shows, where management teams might reveal more about their true strategy when speaking to broader stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. Publicly available presentations by executives at industry events are a rich source of information, often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. This allows for deep study of companies, giving them a unique ability to underwrite value that others might not perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.

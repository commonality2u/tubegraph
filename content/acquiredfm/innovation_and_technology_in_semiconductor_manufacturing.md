Semiconductor manufacturing has undergone immense transformation over the decades, driven by relentless innovation and technological advancements. At the core of this evolution lies [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)]], whose journey exemplifies the remarkable progress in this sector. This article highlights key innovations and technologies in semiconductor manufacturing, referencing TSMC's pivotal role in the industry.

## The Integrated Circuit Revolution

The invention of the [[semiconductors_industry_overview | integrated circuit (IC)]] stands as a landmark achievement in semiconductor technology. In the late 1950s, Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor independently invented the IC, drastically reducing the cost of electronic functions by hundreds of thousands of times. As Jack Kilby articulated, the impact of ICs was unparalleled: reducing the cost of electronic functions by a factor of a million to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Transition to Silicon and the Evolution of Fabs

Initially, semiconductors were manufactured using germanium, but silicon eventually became the preferred substrate due to its abundance and cost-effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This shift to silicon enabled large-scale production and refined manufacturing processes, giving rise to [[the_evolution_of_semiconductor_design_and_manufacturing | fabrication facilities]], or fabs.

## The Birth of the Contract Foundry Model

In the 1980s, Morris Chang, founder of [[morris_chang_and_the_foundation_of_tsmc | TSMC]], introduced a novel business model: the pure-play foundry. This model separated the design and manufacturing stages, allowing companies to focus on designing chips without the burden of maintaining fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. This innovation proved instrumental in fostering the growth of the semiconductor industry, facilitating the rise of [[fabulous_companies_and_their_impact_on_tsmc | fabulous companies]] like Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Broadcom.

## The Drive for Smaller Nodes

TSMC has advanced semiconductor manufacturing by consistently pushing the envelope in process technology. Throughout its history, TSMC has successfully reduced the node size, reaching the current leading-edge 5-nanometer process with plans to introduce a 3-nanometer process in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Smaller nodes enable more transistors on a chip, enhancing performance and energy efficiency.

## Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV)

A significant breakthrough in semiconductor manufacturing is the adoption of EUV lithography by companies like TSMC. EUV technology enables the production of finer details on chips by using extremely short wavelengths of light. The process involves creating a plasma, generating EUV light, and utilizing specialized lithography machines developed by ASML, a Dutch company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This technology is central to manufacturing the most advanced semiconductor nodes today.

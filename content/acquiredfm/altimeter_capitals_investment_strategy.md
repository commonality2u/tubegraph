Altimeter Capital, founded by Brad Gerstner, operates with a unique dual approach, simultaneously running both a hedge fund and a venture capital firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>. This structure allows Altimeter to function as a lifecycle investor, participating in companies across their private and public stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

## Founding Vision and Philosophy

Brad Gerstner's background as an entrepreneur who started five companies shaped his unique mentality for investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:2:05">[00:2:05]</a>.
His upbringing in a small rural town in northern Indiana, marked by his father's failed entrepreneurial venture and subsequent financial struggles, instilled in him a deep understanding of personal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This experience made him wary of political fundraising, which he perceived as a personal ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. He observed that in Silicon Valley, the risk of failure is largely borne by the venture capitalist due to portfolio diversification, making it a "badge of courage" for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

A pivotal conversation with Rich Barton led Gerstner to conclude that he was better suited for investing than entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Barton described entrepreneurs as focused on "the art of the possible" and often suspending disbelief, while investors "think about distribution of probabilities" and what can go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This resonated with Gerstner's lawyerly training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

Gerstner's vision for Altimeter was to build a firm that combined the "best of Tiger [Global]" (scalable capital) with the "best of Sequoia" (founder empathy and support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. He aimed for a "founder's mentality" with the scalability of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

### Origins of the Crossover Model
Gerstner saw a historical precedent for the crossover model in legendary investors like Warren Buffett, who didn't distinguish between public and private investments, simply seeking "great investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. Paul Kedrosky, whom Gerstner apprenticed under at Par Capital, also engaged in private investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.

Altimeter launched on November 1, 2008, amidst the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. Despite initial commitments drying up due to market uncertainty and fear of "co-mingled funds" (private positions in public vehicles), Gerstner pressed on with limited capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. His first trade was into Priceline (now Booking.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

## Investment Strategy

Altimeter's strategy is built on several core tenets:

### Market Dislocation and Thematic Investing
Altimeter seeks to identify major market changes and human behaviors that create opportunities for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. This involves deconstructing global trends to understand underlying themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.

#### Pillars of Focus:
1.  **Internet Transactional Commerce (early 2000s)**: Recognizing the internet's chaotic nature and the need for organization, Altimeter focused on "search" (horizontal and vertical) as a dominant theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. This led to investments in beneficiaries of search, such as:
    *   Priceline (now Booking.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>
    *   Kayak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>
    *   Zillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>
    *   Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>
    *   Baidu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>
    *   Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>
2.  **Mobile Disruption (2010s)**: Recognizing that mobile devices would disrupt desktop search, Altimeter shifted focus to companies that would become "icons" on phone screens, benefiting from the switch to mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.
    *   Facebook (largest investment in 2012, post-IPO, when it was undervalued due to monetization concerns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
3.  **Cloud Computing & Enterprise Software (2010s onwards)**: Altimeter foresaw the remaking of the database market in the cloud and the shift of enterprise spend to cloud-based solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. Key insights included:
    *   Cloud was safer than on-premise data centers (especially after events like the Sony hack) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>.
    *   The cost and efficacy of cloud computing would eventually surpass traditional data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>.
    *   Belief that "not all software is created equal" and certain types of software (e.g., databases) would be remade for the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
    *   Example: Leading the Series C in Snowflake in 2013-2014, with conviction based on internal use and understanding the long-term potential of purpose-built cloud infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>.

### Investment Principles
*   **Concentrated Portfolio**: Altimeter maintains a reasonably concentrated portfolio, believing that a few high-conviction deals should be able to return the entire fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:45]</a>.
*   **Non-Consensus Thinking**: Following Warren Buffett's philosophy, the firm seeks non-consensus ideas, acknowledging that this path is "most often wrong" but yields superior returns when correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Horizon & Public Market Holding**: A key differentiator is the ability to hold investments for extended periods, including after they go public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. This requires matching the investment's duration with the limited partners' (LPs) capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>.
*   **Collaboration over Early-Stage Competition**: Altimeter prefers to partner with founders in later stages, after initial "craft building" by early investors like Sequoia or Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. They believe the most crucial early years benefit from investors deeply entrenched in supporting initial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.
*   **Capital Markets Expertise**: Altimeter boasts a strong capital markets business, helping companies navigate the transition to public markets via traditional IPOs, direct listings, or SPACs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. This provides founders with "inside scoop" and unbiased advice, as Altimeter can anchor or participate in any of these mechanisms without a financial incentive to push one over the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:21">[01:24:21]</a>.

## Impact and Future Outlook

Altimeter aims to deliver "radically superior returns" for its LPs and achieve high "NPS scores" (Net Promoter Score) among founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. This focus on founder satisfaction, driven by empathy and value-add in critical moments (recruiting, board building, going public), is central to their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

Brad Gerstner advocates for a more inclusive capital system through initiatives like "Invest America," which proposes providing every child in the U.S. with an investment account. This would allow all citizens to participate in the wealth creation driven by the technology revolution, which naturally tends toward concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>. He believes this would foster a sense of belonging and provide psychological benefits beyond financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:30">[01:45:30]</a>.

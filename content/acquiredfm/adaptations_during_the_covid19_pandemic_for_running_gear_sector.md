The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique challenges and opportunities for companies in the running gear sector, necessitating rapid adaptations in business models and supply chains. Brooks Running, under CEO Jim Weber, serves as a notable example of a company that successfully navigated this period by leveraging its core focus and data-driven insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

## Initial Challenges and Observations

In March 2020, the onset of the pandemic caused significant disruption across the retail landscape. For Brooks, approximately 90% of its products were sold through retailers, leading to widespread store shutdowns in Europe and North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. This immediately froze the cash cycle, creating a period of intense uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

However, Brooks had prior experience with economic downturns, observing that running tended to be recession-resistant. During the Great Recession, for instance, running participation saw double-digit growth in regions like Italy and Spain, partly due to its affordability and convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>. The pandemic further highlighted running's "COVID-friendly" nature, as it aligned with social distancing requirements and could be done outdoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.

## Brooks' Strategic Response

Brooks' ability to adapt effectively stemmed from its deep [[focus_on_active_runners_and_performance_innovation | customer obsession]] and multi-channel approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

### Market Understanding and Data
Brooks developed a hypothesis that running would recover and used several methods to validate it:
*   **Strava Data**: Daily Strava activity showed consistent growth after initial quarantine shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.
*   **Field Marketing**: Brooks deployed its 45 U.S. field marketing personnel to high-traffic running parks to count runners daily, confirming an increase in participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.
*   **Digital Sales Monitoring**: With visibility into 85% of its retail sell-through, Brooks observed a dramatic shift in digital sales, which increased from 30% to 80% of all product sales by the end of April 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

### Supply Chain Agility
A critical adaptation involved swiftly reactivating the supply chain. Brooks turned its supply chain back on 6 to 12 weeks earlier than many other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. This confidence was rooted in its exclusive [[focus_on_active_runners_and_performance_innovation | focus on performance running gear]], unlike broad-based retailers with diverse product lines that faced greater uncertainty about customer return for lifestyle products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. Managing inventory well is crucial in apparel and footwear, as excess stock can ruin future product cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>.

### Focus on Core Product
The decision, made years prior, to "burn the boats" and exclusively serve active runners proved to be a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This singular focus allowed Brooks to react quickly, as it knew its customer base and their consistent need for replacement running shoes, which are considered consumable items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

## Outcomes and Learnings
Brooks' proactive [[the_importance_of_adaptability_in_business_models | adaptations]] led to significant growth during the pandemic:
*   In May 2020, Brooks sold more product through digital channels than it had in all channels in May 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.
*   The company grew by 27% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.
*   In 2021, Brooks grew by 31%, and would have achieved 40% growth if not for supply chain issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.
*   Brooks achieved over $1.13 billion in revenue in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>, entering a "rarefied club" of billion-dollar brands, unique for its premium, full-price product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

Despite these successes, Jim Weber notes that [[challenges_and_opportunities_during_uncertain_times | operational resilience and agility in the supply chain]] remain critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>. Diversifying risk in manufacturing locations, especially after severe shutdowns in Vietnam affected production in late 2021, is a key focus for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

[[origin_and_development_of_ebay|eBay]], originally conceived as a collection of internet services by Pierre Omidyar, rapidly evolved into a significant e-commerce platform, leading to remarkable financial outcomes for its founders and early investors, particularly [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]] Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Early Growth and Profitability

Pierre Omidyar, an engineer working full-time at General Magic, began tinkering with the early internet in his free time, starting what he called "eBay" for "electronic Bay Area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Among various features on the site, "Auction Web" emerged as the most significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Initially, Omidyar hosted these auctions for free with no business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

However, as traffic surged, server costs became prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Reluctantly, Omidyar asked users to pay a small listing fee to cover expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Users responded by deluging his apartment with checks, demonstrating strong product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This led Omidyar to bring on Jeff Skoll, a Stanford Business School MBA, to manage the incoming payments and formalize the business side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

[[origin_and_development_of_ebay|eBay]] quickly became a fast-growth, profitable company, generating cash flow from these listing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It was growing at an impressive 10% per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Fundraising and Acquisition Offers

Despite being profitable, Omidyar recognized the value of venture capitalists (VCs) and a professional board for the company's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He and Jeff Skoll pitched to numerous VCs on Sand Hill Road, but nearly all turned them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### The [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]] Investment

[[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]] Capital, however, showed interest, largely due to Bruce Dunleavy, an investor in Omidyar's previous company, Inc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, and partner Bob Kagle's interest in consumer psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. They offered a Series A financing term sheet of $6.7 million at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Competing Acquisition Offer

At the same time, Omidyar and Skoll had a competing offer from Knight-Ridder, a large newspaper conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This was an acquisition offer, valued at $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Jeff Skoll had briefly worked for Knight-Ridder post-MBA, making the offer somewhat logical given [[origin_and_development_of_ebay|eBay]]'s resemblance to an online classifieds business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### The Secondary Debate

One highly untraditional aspect of the [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]] deal was the debate around a secondary transaction for the founders.

> "There is a version of the story where none of the money that [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]] invested in [[origin_and_development_of_ebay|eBay]] was actually used by the company... they were always profitable... I don't think any of it ever left the balance sheet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
>
> "What was reported... is that [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]] had also structured equity-backed loans to Pierre and Jeff in the amount of 750,000 each... to prevent them essentially give them an incentive not to take the acquisition offer from Knight Rider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
>
> This totaled $1.5 million paid to Pierre and Jeff, effectively a secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Some accounts even suggest 50% of the investment round was used as a secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. However, other accounts deny any secondary existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This innovative approach, though non-consensus at the time, allowed entrepreneurs to take some money off the table and avoid selling the company early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## The [[fundraising_and_initial_public_offerings|IPO]] and Astronomical Returns

The deal was finalized in the summer of 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. By September 1998, just over a year later, [[origin_and_development_of_ebay|eBay]] went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This was after Meg Whitman, a superstar from Hasbro and formerly of Disney, was recruited by [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]] and David Byrne to serve as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

*   **[[fundraising_and_initial_public_offerings|IPO]] Value**: At the [[fundraising_and_initial_public_offerings|IPO]] in September 1998, [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]]'s $6.7 million investment was worth $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Post-Lockup Value**: By the time the six-month lockup period expired in spring 1999, that stake had soared to over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Fund Return**: [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]]'s $6.7 million investment from their $85 million fund turned into $4 billion in less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This represented an unreal Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and 47x their fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Potential Kicker**: If the Washington Post's report on the equity-backed loans totaling $1.5 million to the founders was true and incremental to the equity investment, it could have added another $1 billion, an additional 12x return on the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Distributed Returns**: [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]] distributed $4 billion in real returns to its limited partners (LPs) and General Partners (GPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Even considering the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the fund's mark was reported as 92x, with at least a 50x realized return for the fund as $4 billion was actually distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

This massive success meant approximately $1.5 billion in carry dollars to be distributed among the equal partnership of [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_and_impact_on_ebay|Benchmark]], with pieces even given to their assistants, making them multi-millionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

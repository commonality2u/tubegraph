Dr. [[Jensen Huangs leadership and strategic decisions | Morris Chang]], the 93-year-old founder of [[Role of TSMC in the semiconductor ecosystem | TSMC]], played a pivotal role in shaping the global semiconductor industry through his visionary leadership and strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. His approach, detailed in Volume 2 of his autobiography, focused on crucial stories from [[Role of TSMC in the Global Semiconductor Industry | TSMC]]'s history, including its relationships with Apple and [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | Nvidia]], and the birth of the "fabulous" (fabless) industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Return as CEO and Addressing Internal Challenges (2009)

In 2009, [[Jensen Huangs leadership and strategic decisions | Morris Chang]] returned as CEO, having previously stepped down to retain only the chairmanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. His return was prompted by several issues, including manufacturing and quality problems with the 40 nanometer (nm) node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

He faced immediate challenges:
*   **Layoff Reversal:** The previous CEO had laid off approximately 600-700 employees based on poor performance reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Chang, who had never implemented layoffs during his tenure, preferred probation or transfers to address performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. He considered performance ratings subjective and not a credible basis for layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. Upon his return, he offered to rehire all laid-off employees who were interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. This decision was influenced by employee protests, including a sleepover near his home that his wife addressed by providing breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.
*   **Organizational Restructuring:** He disapproved of the previous CEO's decision to split operations into "advanced" and "mainstream" technology groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. He unified these groups and established a robust "Business Development" department (which he considered strategic marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. He appointed C.C. Wei (current CEO) to lead this critical department, recognizing its importance for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>. This was despite Wei having less experience in marketing compared to his previous operations role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.

## [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | Resolving the Nvidia Dispute]]

A significant priority upon his return was resolving a long-standing dispute with [[Nvidia]] over quality and yield issues on the 40nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The relationship with [[Nvidia]] dated back to 1997 when [[Jensen Huangs leadership and strategic decisions | Jensen Huang]], then leading a small, struggling company, directly appealed to Chang for foundry services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Chang, irritated by his San Jose office's neglect of a potential customer, personally contacted Huang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. [[Nvidia]]'s first chip, manufactured by [[TSMC]], was highly successful, saving the company and making it a major [[Role of TSMC in the semiconductor ecosystem | TSMC]] customer within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

To resolve the 40nm dispute, Chang personally took charge, familiarizing himself with all aspects of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. He calculated a compensation figure over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. He then visited [[Jensen Huangs leadership and strategic decisions | Jensen Huang]] at his home, proposing a dinner with pizza and salad, followed by a business discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. Chang presented the offer with a 48-hour acceptance window, stating that otherwise, they would resort to arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. [[Jensen Huangs leadership and strategic decisions | Jensen Huang]] accepted, leading to a continued successful partnership that has since generated billions of dollars in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.

## Strategic Investments and the "Sweet Spot"

A key decision was his commitment to increased R&D and capital expenditure. Drawing from his experience at Texas Instruments, where his requests for R&D increases were denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>, Chang established a fixed 8% of revenue for R&D at [[TSMC]], regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. This empowered his R&D team to pursue ambitious goals.

His team identified the 28nm node as a "Sweet Spot" â€“ a critical technological advancement that would drive significant demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. Based on this, and other market forecasts from his newly structured business development group, Chang decided to massively increase capital spending threefold in 2010, from around $2.5 billion to nearly $6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. This decision, though met with questions from the board, was a crucial bet on the future, which coincided with the rise of the smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.

## [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | The Apple Relationship]]

The most significant validation of [[Jensen Huangs leadership and strategic decisions | Morris Chang]]'s strategic investment came with Apple's interest. The initial contact with Apple came unexpectedly through a dinner invitation from Terry Gou, chairman of Foxconn and a relative of Chang's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. Apple's COO, Jeff Williams, directly pitched to Chang, seeking [[TSMC]]'s services for their chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.

A major point of contention was Apple's request for [[TSMC]] to develop a 20nm node, which was a "detour" from [[TSMC]]'s planned progression from 28nm to 16nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. At the time, [[TSMC]]'s R&D resources could not handle two leading nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. Apple's demand was so large that it would require significant additional capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>.

Chang, after careful financial planning and consultation with Goldman Sachs (a relationship he had cultivated early in [[TSMC]]'s history) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>, decided to meet half of Apple's demand for the 20nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>. This required borrowing billions of dollars but avoided cutting dividends or issuing new stock, which could harm shareholder relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>.

In February 2011, Apple paused discussions to consider Intel's offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:08">[01:37:08]</a>. Chang, however, was not overly concerned. He believed [[TSMC]] was at par with Intel in technology and superior in manufacturing and customer trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. He famously recounted that Tim Cook's explanation for choosing [[TSMC]] was simply: "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. Chang interpreted this as Intel's lack of understanding in responding courteously to customer requests and fostering trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

The decision to pursue the 20nm node for Apple had a trade-off: it delayed [[TSMC]]'s 16nm development, allowing Samsung to gain a lead and secure initial 16nm orders from Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>. However, Jeff Williams reassured Chang that Apple would buy from [[TSMC]] once their 16nm was ready, which indeed happened, securing most of Apple's 16nm requirements for [[TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:42">[01:53:42]</a>.

## Business Philosophy and Foresight

[[Jensen Huangs leadership and strategic decisions | Morris Chang]]'s leadership was characterized by several core principles:
*   **Pure-Play Foundry Model:** From its inception, Chang envisioned [[TSMC]] as a pure-play foundry that would not compete with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:26">[02:22:26]</a>. This was a differentiating factor from integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>. He saw the rise of fabless companies early on, citing a meeting with Gordon Campbell who intended to start a company without building a fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:29">[02:18:29]</a>.
*   **Learning Curve Theory:** Chang was a serious student of the learning curve theory, which he refined at Texas Instruments with Bruce Henderson and Bill Bain (founders of BCG and Bain & Company, respectively) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a>. This theory suggests that as production volume increases, unit costs decrease due to gained experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>. [[Jensen Huangs leadership and strategic decisions | TSMC]] applied this by aiming for the largest volume to achieve the lowest prices, accelerating pricing to future levels to outcompete rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. This strategy required accurate market forecasting and aggressive capital deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:31">[02:40:31]</a>.
*   **Customer Trust:** He emphasized building deep customer trust, in contrast to the perceived arrogance of older IDMs like Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>. He noted that Intel's PC maker customers in Taiwan disliked and distrusted them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:24">[01:46:24]</a>. [[TSMC]]'s willingness to "confiscate" deposits from customers who reneged on orders, though never actually enforced, instilled discipline and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:37">[02:26:37]</a>.
*   **Anticipation of Industry Trends:** Chang believed that "sitting here as foundry... I can see some things that... before they actually happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:28">[01:55:28]</a>. He correctly anticipated IBM's semiconductor business decline when Qualcomm shifted its foundry business to [[TSMC]] in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:41">[01:58:41]</a>. He also refused IBM's proposal for co-development of a 0.13 micron node, recognizing the cultural incompatibility and risk to [[TSMC]]'s independent process development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

## Impact and Legacy

Under [[Jensen Huangs leadership and strategic decisions | Morris Chang]]'s leadership, [[TSMC]] grew into a trillion-dollar company, riding the "ridiculous Tailwind" of the semiconductor market, which expanded from $26 billion in 1987 to $527 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. Its success is rooted in its unique pure-play model, strategic R&D and capital investments, and a deep understanding of the learning curve and customer relationships. The concentration of the semiconductor ecosystem in Taiwan's Hsinchu Science Park, a government-funded initiative, further solidified [[TSMC]]'s competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:03">[02:28:03]</a>.

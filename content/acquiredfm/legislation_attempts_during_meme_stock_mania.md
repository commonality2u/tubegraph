During the period of the [[Meme stock craze and Wall Street bets | meme stock craze]], particularly around the GameStop phenomenon, there were significant attempts and discussions within the House Financial Services Committee regarding potential [[Congressional hearings and challenges in passing reform bills | legislation]] to address issues highlighted by the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Focus and Efforts
A representative on the House Financial Services Committee indicated that the [[Meme stock craze and Wall Street bets | meme stock craze]], along with China capital markets and [[time_spent_on_crypto_in_congress | crypto]], were the three areas on which they spent the most time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The events of the [[Meme stock craze and Wall Street bets | meme stock craze]] were described as "interesting and fun" to follow, especially on [[Meme stock craze and Wall Street bets | Wall Street bets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Considerable effort was expended, including "real work" and four separate [[Congressional hearings and challenges in passing reform bills | hearings]] to understand the situation, which also garnered national media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. During one of these remote [[Congressional hearings and challenges in passing reform bills | hearings]], the representative monitored the [[Meme stock craze and Wall Street bets | Wall Street bets]] forum in real-time on a separate computer, observing audience reactions to speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Legislative Proposals and Outcomes
Despite the extensive work and [[Congressional hearings and challenges in passing reform bills | hearings]], ultimately, no significant [[Congressional hearings and challenges in passing reform bills | legislation]] came out of the [[Meme stock craze and Wall Street bets | meme stock mania]] that resulted in substantive changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The representative expressed disappointment regarding this outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Proposed Bipartisan Reform
One key bipartisan change suggested was to [[Congressional hearings and challenges in passing reform bills | pass a bill]] to shorten the settlement time for trades from two days to one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This measure was believed to reduce overall risk in the system and potentially could have prevented actions like Robinhood halting trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Democrats' Bill and Its Fate
Instead of pursuing the settlement time reform, Democrats proposed a bill that incorporated "a whole bunch of things" they had aimed to achieve over the previous decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. While this bill [[Congressional hearings and challenges in passing reform bills | passed the House]], it was not expected to advance in the Senate, meaning "nothing changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Challenges to Legislation
The failure to enact meaningful [[Congressional hearings and challenges in passing reform bills | legislation]] was attributed to the issue becoming a "[[Congressional hearings and challenges in passing reform bills | political casualty]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This scenario, where issues become bogged down in political maneuvering, was noted as a common and frustrating aspect of Washington politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The representative remarked that such outcomes are not partisan, suggesting that either party, when in control, might prioritize their long-standing agendas over direct responses to specific events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

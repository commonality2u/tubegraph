The relationship between [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Jeff Bezos]] and a key group of Stanford Computer Science PhDs began with the acquisition of Junglee by Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This connection ultimately led to [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Jeff Bezos]]'s significant early personal investment in Google.

## The Junglee Acquisition

Junglee, a comparison shopping site, was founded by three Stanford Computer Science PhDs and a business partner from Netscape named Ram Sriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Amazon acquired Junglee for approximately $150-175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

However, the acquisition was ill-conceived from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Amazon required the Palo Alto-based Junglee team to relocate to Seattle to avoid a tax nexus in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The team reportedly disliked Seattle, and within a few months, they all quit and moved back to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Notably, these former Junglee founders later started a company that Walmart acquired, which became Walmart Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Ram Sriram and Google's Founding

Upon returning to Palo Alto, Ram Sriram connected with two other Stanford Computer Science PhDs, Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Ram made the initial $250,000 investment in Google (then known for its "BackRub PageRank" concept) and joined its board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This occurred while [[amazons_founding_and_early_years | Amazon]] was already a public company, predating Google's official founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Jeff Bezos's Personal Investment in Google

Approximately six months after Ram's initial investment, [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Jeff Bezos]] learned about Google through his maintained friendship with Ram Sriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Bezos]] and MacKenzie flew to Silicon Valley to meet Page and Brin at Ram's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

After the meeting, [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Bezos]] expressed a strong desire to invest in Google on the same terms as Ram, despite the seed round having closed and major venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital already circling for a Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Ram advocated for [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Bezos]], convincing Larry and Sergey to accept an additional $250,000 from [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Jeff]] and MacKenzie's personal funds at the original seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The subsequent Series A for Google, which was notably split between John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins and Mike Moritz at Sequoia, valued the company at an "insane" $100 million post-money valuation for the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. It's estimated that Ram's initial investment might have been at a $10 million or even lower post-money valuation, potentially giving him a 10-20x return by the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Impact of the Investment

It is widely believed that [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Jeff]] and MacKenzie Bezos personally owned at least one percent of Google, even after dilution from the Series A, as Google did not raise another venture round before its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

When Google IPO'd in 2004 with a $23 billion market cap, their shares would have been worth approximately $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Since then, Google's value has increased by 65 times over the subsequent 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. While [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Bezos]] has never publicly commented on whether he and MacKenzie sold their Google shares, they would have held them at least until the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This significant personal investment provided [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Bezos]] with substantial capital, enabling him to fund various personal ventures like "crazy cool clocks" and rocket companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

Klarna, a name synonymous with "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL), has played a pioneering role in the payments landscape, evolving from a small startup to a global payments leader. In this article, we delve into the genesis of [[buy_now_pay_later_services_and_their_evolution | Klarna]], its innovative business model, and its growth trajectory over the years.

## Founding Vision

Klarna was founded in 2004 in Stockholm, Sweden, by Sebastian Siemiatkowski and his co-founders. Inspired by the stories of successful entrepreneurs such as the [[history_of_ikea | founder of IKEA]] and Richard Branson, Sebastian always harbored ambitions of starting a company. His interest in economics and previous work experiences led him to identify a niche in the payments sector that Klarna expertly filled. The foundational idea of Klarna revolved around transforming and simplifying the online purchasing experience by allowing consumers to buy products and pay for them later, effectively removing the perceived risk associated with e-commerce. The concept offered customers a unique value proposition: the ability to receive and inspect products before payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Breakthrough

Initially called a "Buy Now, Pay Later" service, Klarna gained traction due to its consumer-friendly approach. Sebastian realized early on that traditional payment methods were not always suitable for online purchases. This insight was drawn from his experience working at a factoring and collections company, where he noticed that many e-commerce merchants sought convenient payment solutions but did not necessarily prioritize immediate cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This realization led to a business model where Klarna absorbed the risk of non-payment and managed the administration of payments, allowing merchants to access funds after a set period, typically three weeks, which helped Klarna maintain positive cash flow without extensive external funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Growth and Expansion

Klarna’s growth trajectory was rapid in its early years. By offering a service that resonated well with both consumers and merchants, the company became profitable just six months post-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This profitability was achieved with minimal investment, only requiring $30,000 from the initial capital raise. Klarna initially expanded within Scandinavia, moving from Sweden into Norway and Finland due to merchant demand. The next major markets were Germany and the Netherlands, where there was a strong tradition of invoice-based payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

## Turning Point and the Global Stage

The real turning point for Klarna's business came with its expansion into the UK and US markets. Initially cautious about these regions due to the prevalence of credit cards, Klarna capitalized on the changing consumer habits post the 2007 financial crisis. This period saw a decline in credit card usage and a shift towards debit cards, offering Klarna's services a newfound appeal among consumers who were wary of traditional credit options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

In the US, despite early hurdles, Klarna leveraged technology such as [[ai_and_machine_learning_advancements | AI]] to enhance customer service and operational efficiency, ultimately boosting customer satisfaction ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Today, Klarna operates in multiple countries, serving over 150 million users globally and facilitating over 2 million transactions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

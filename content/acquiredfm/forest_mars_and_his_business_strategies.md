From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Forest Mars, Sr. was a visionary entrepreneur and the driving force behind the global expansion and diversification of [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars Incorporated]]. His relentless ambition and unique [[business_strategies_and_history | business strategies]] transformed his family's candy company into one of the world's largest and most private corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>. He is considered one of the greatest American entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:31">[02:38:31]</a>.

## Early Life and Influences

Born in 1883 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, Frank Clarence Mars, Forest's father, started his first candy company in Minneapolis in 1902 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. However, this initial venture and two subsequent ones failed due to the perishable nature of penny candies and lack of air conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

Forest's childhood was marked by adversity. He contracted polio at a young age, which affected his legs and required him to wear orthopedic braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. This meant he spent his time indoors, baking candy with his mother, Elva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. In 1910, after his father's bankruptcy, Forest's mother divorced Frank and sent six-year-old Forest to live with her parents in rural Saskatchewan, Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. This deeply traumatic childhood instilled in him an intense drive and a chip on his shoulder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:55">[03:40:55]</a>.

Despite his upbringing in a hardscrabble mining community, Forest was highly intelligent, entrepreneurial, and ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. He reportedly won a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied mining engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. During his freshman year, he earned double the average American income by sourcing cheaper ingredients for the cafeteria and splitting the savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

After reconnecting with his father, who had found moderate success with a new chocolate candy business, Forest's [[business_strategies_and_history | ambitions]] shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. He transferred to Yale, seeking to learn about [[business_strategies_and_history | business]] and meet influential people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. His roommate was the nephew of Pierre S. duPont, then running DuPont and General Motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Forest diligently pumped Pierre for lessons on managing large-scale industrial operations, accounting, and planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

## European Venture and the Mars Principles

In 1932, following a contentious dispute with his father, Frank, over reinvesting profits and expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>, Forest left the family business with $50,000 and the international recipe rights for the Milky Way bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. He then moved to Europe with his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

> "You can hire lawyers, you can hire accountants, you can hire advertising men or financial types, but if you want to get rich you got to know how to make a product and you aren't going to hire anybody to make a product for you to make you rich they'll only make it for themselves." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>

In pursuit of this philosophy, Forest moved to Switzerland in 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. He worked anonymously as a factory line worker at Jean Tobler and later at Nestle, learning the intricate processes of chocolate making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. This hands-on experience in manufacturing was crucial for his "empire-minded" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a>.

Upon moving to England, he opened a small factory in Slough and began producing a British-adapted version of the Milky Way, which he named the Mars Bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. The Mars Bar quickly became a success, making Mars UK the third-largest candy company in Britain by 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>.

In 1934, Forest diversified into the pet food business by acquiring Chapel Brothers, which made "Chappies" brand canned dog food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>. This was a pioneering move, as pet food as a distinct category was virtually nonexistent at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>. This venture proved highly profitable, generating cash flow to fund further expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>.

During this period in England, Forest established the core principles that would define Mars's culture and [[business_strategies_and_history | strategies]]:

*   **Quality:** Forest was obsessed with product quality, implementing a system where any employee could stop the production line due to a defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>. This was akin to the Toyota production system, long before its formalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:58">[01:29:58]</a>. He also emphasized "value for money," ensuring high quality at a competitive price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>.
*   **Responsibility:** To attract and retain top talent, Mars paid employees three to four times the normal salary for their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:11">[01:32:11]</a>. Bonuses were tied to overall company performance, not individual metrics, fostering a collective sense of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>. Notably, a 10% bonus was contingent on not being late, a rule that applied to everyone, including the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. The company also adopted an "associate" title for all employees and operated with no executive perks or private offices, creating the first open-office company in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:09">[01:34:09]</a>.
*   **Mutuality:** Forest believed in fostering strong relationships with retailers, suppliers, and distributors, ensuring everyone in the ecosystem profited from their partnership with Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:59">[01:35:59]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** Forest deeply studied [[business_strategies_and_history | business management literature]], adopting "return on total assets" (ROTA) as the primary management metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:33">[01:37:33]</a>. Mars targeted an 18% ROTA, meaning every investment needed to pay for itself in less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:34">[01:40:34]</a>. This obsession with [[business_strategies_and_history | efficiency]] led to highly industrialized production, with factories running 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>. By 1990, Mars generated more output per worker than any competitor, with significantly fewer employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>. They also aggressively reinvested profits into R&D for new manufacturing equipment, which they kept as trade secrets rather than patenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>.
*   **Freedom:** This principle, initially about Forest's independence from his father, evolved to mean family ownership, private operations, and avoiding debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>. The Mars family maintains extreme privacy, even paying $20,000 to buy back photographs from a newspaper that published a piece about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:36">[01:44:36]</a>. This private ownership allows for long-term investments and strategy without public market pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>.

## Return to America and M&M's

In 1939, sensing an opportunity and facing heavy foreign resident taxes in the UK, Forest returned to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>. Unable to gain control of his father's company (then run by his stepmother and her half-brother), Forest decided to start anew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:46">[01:48:46]</a>.

His secret weapon was a new type of candy he'd seen in Europe: chocolate coated with a hard candy shell to prevent melting, popular with soldiers in the Spanish Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>. He named it M&M's, standing for Mars and Murray (Bruce Murray, son of William Murray, president of Hershey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:43">[01:57:43]</a>. This strategic joint venture with Hershey's William Murray gave M&M's access to Hershey's chocolate supply and, crucially, its exclusive military distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:14">[01:59:14]</a>.

The timing was perfect, as the US entered World War II shortly after M&M's production began in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. M&M's became a staple ration for US troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:48">[02:04:48]</a>, establishing its presence without direct consumer marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:39">[02:08:39]</a>.

During the war, Forest also co-founded a new company in Houston, Texas, in 1942, to produce parboiled rice for the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>. This branded product, later known as Uncle Ben's Rice, became a billion-dollar annual business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>.

After the war, M&M's faced tepid consumer sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:14">[02:09:14]</a>. Forest, determined to gain full control, allegedly resorted to psychological tactics, posting Bruce Murray's "failed" daily sales reports in the men's bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>. In 1949, Forest successfully bought out Bruce's 20% stake, gaining 100% ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:53">[02:10:53]</a>.

Forest then hired the Ted Bates ad agency in 1950 to conduct extensive market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:46">[02:12:46]</a>. They discovered that M&M's appealed strongly to children, despite the industry's focus on adult markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>. This led to the iconic slogan: "The milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand," a stroke of marketing genius targeting parents concerned about mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:57">[02:15:57]</a>. M&M's became the biggest-selling candy in America by 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:40">[02:17:40]</a>, surpassing the Hershey Bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:58">[02:17:58]</a>. This success prompted the addition of the "M" on each candy in 1954 to prevent copycats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:10">[02:18:10]</a>.

## Reclaiming Mars Inc.

After his stepmother's death in 1945, Forest inherited a third of [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Chicago Mars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>. By the mid-1950s, his personal empire (including Mars UK, M&M's, and Uncle Ben's Rice) was four times the size of [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Chicago Mars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:53">[02:32:53]</a>. He began lobbying his half-sister, Patricia, and the board to gain control, even moving to Chicago to inspect operations and criticize management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>.

In 1963, as [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Chicago Mars]] revenues plummeted under Patricia's husband's leadership, Forest finally convinced Patricia to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:53">[02:32:53]</a>. By mid-1964, Forest gained full control of [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars Incorporated]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:49">[02:28:49]</a>.

His first actions were immediate and dramatic: he eliminated all private offices, executive perks, sold company assets like art and a helicopter, and instituted time cards for every employee, including himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>. After Patricia's death later that year, he fired her husband and made himself CEO of the entire unified empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:32">[02:30:32]</a>.

## Final Conquest and Retirement

Forest's final major conquest was to make [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars]] independent of Hershey for chocolate supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:19">[02:31:19]</a>. He gave his plant managers six months to begin producing their own chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:57">[02:32:57]</a>. This move, despite initial concerns about profitability, aligned with his quality principle and allowed Mars to scale production as large as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:11">[02:33:11]</a>.

[[comparison_of_mars_with_hershey_and_other_confectionery_giants | Hershey's]] adherence to its "nickel bar" price from 1900 to 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:24">[02:40:24]</a>, which led to continuous shrinking of their bar size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:10">[02:41:10]</a>, created an opening for [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars]]. When [[comparison_of_mars_with_hershey_and_other_confectionery_giants | Hershey]] finally doubled its price in 1969, consumers were outraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:07">[02:43:07]</a>. Forest responded by increasing advertising and the size of Mars bars while keeping prices stable, initiating a price and size war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a>.

This [[business_strategies_and_history | strategy]], coupled with [[comparison_of_mars_with_hershey_and_other_confectionery_giants | Hershey's]] inconsistent advertising efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:54">[02:44:54]</a>, allowed [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars]] to become the number one candy company in America by 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>. [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars's]] reliance on nougat and peanuts in its bars provided a durable competitive advantage, as these ingredients were cheaper than solid chocolate, allowing for lower costs of goods sold while maintaining perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:06">[02:46:06]</a>. [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars]] also developed a sophisticated commodities trading department, reportedly making billions in profits from market swings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:03">[02:47:03]</a>.

In late 1973, Forest Mars, then 76 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:42">[02:49:42]</a>, retired, handing the company over to his three children: Forest Jr., John, and Jackie Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>. The company's annual revenue stood at about $800 million at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:01">[02:49:01]</a>.

## Later Life and Ethel M Chocolates

Forest's retirement was short-lived. In 1980, at 76, he started another candy company, Ethel M Chocolates, named after his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:56">[02:49:56]</a>. His business plan was to compete with high-end chocolate companies, specializing in liquor-filled chocolates, which were popular in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:46">[02:50:46]</a>. He moved to Nevada, the epicenter for such chocolates, and built a factory with an apartment directly above it, from which he ran the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:15">[02:51:15]</a>. Ethel M Chocolates quickly achieved $150 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:55">[02:51:55]</a> before being acquired by [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars]] in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:17">[02:52:17]</a>.

## Legacy and Enduring Strategies

Forest Mars's influence on [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars Incorporated]] was profound, shaping its [[business_strategies_and_history | strategies]] and culture for decades:

### [[business_strategies_and_history | Scale Economies]]
[[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars]] excelled at leveraging [[business_strategies_and_history | scale economies]]. By standardizing production processes and running factories 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>, they achieved massive output and lower per-unit costs, allowing them to offer competitive prices while maintaining high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>. This was critical in the candy industry, where consumers prioritize value and impulse purchases dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:06">[02:31:06]</a>.

### Branding and Marketing Innovation
While [[comparison_of_mars_with_hershey_and_other_confectionery_giants | Hershey]] historically avoided advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>, Forest Mars embraced it. The "melts in your mouth, not in your hand" slogan for M&M's was a marketing triumph, appealing directly to parents' desire for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:57">[02:15:57]</a>. [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars]] was also early to sponsor popular children's television shows and later utilized animated characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:54">[02:18:54]</a> and sophisticated campaigns like the "blue M&M's" vote to generate engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:37">[03:28:37]</a>. They strategically associated their brands with universally loved entities like the Olympics, NFL, and even NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:49">[03:25:49]</a>.

### Diversification and [[mars_expansion_and_strategy_in_the_global_market | Global Market Strategy]]
Forest's early diversification into pet food and rice laid the groundwork for [[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars's]] future as a diversified conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:06">[03:05:06]</a>. The company operates decentralized, allowing different business units to focus on their specific markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:36">[03:07:36]</a>. Under his children's leadership, this diversification became a [[mars_expansion_and_strategy_in_the_global_market | global expansion strategy]], taking brands like Snickers to Japan, China, Russia, and South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:22">[02:55:22]</a>.

### Private Ownership and Long-Term View
[[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars]] remains one of the largest private companies in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, allowing it to pursue long-term [[business_strategies_and_history | strategies]] without quarterly reporting pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>. This [[business_strategies_and_history | freedom]] from public scrutiny enabled unique operational choices, such as prioritizing ROTA and investing heavily in internal manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:10">[01:45:10]</a>.

### Strategic Acquisitions
[[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars's]] acquisition [[business_strategies_and_history | strategy]] is characterized by deep understanding of the target business, often making initial small investments before full acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:50">[03:08:50]</a>. Notable acquisitions include Wrigley (2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>, Royal Canin (2002) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:43">[03:06:43]</a>, VCA (2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:04">[03:06:04]</a>, and Kind Bar (2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:43">[03:09:43]</a>. The acquisition of Kellanova (Kellogg's snack and international cereal business) for $35.9 billion in 2023 represents a massive, transformative move to become more like [[mars_expansion_and_strategy_in_the_global_market | Nestle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Recession-Proof Business
Both candy and pet food industries have proven resilient during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:13">[03:10:13]</a>. Candy provides an affordable "dopamine hit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>, while pet care is essential for families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:24">[03:10:24]</a>. This provides a stable revenue base regardless of economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:35">[03:10:35]</a>.

### Commodity Trading
[[history_of_mars_incorporated | Mars]] developed a sophisticated commodities trading department that allowed them to hedge against price swings and even profit from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:03">[02:47:03]</a>, a significant advantage over competitors like [[comparison_of_mars_with_hershey_and_other_confectionery_giants | Hershey]] during periods of volatile cocoa prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:31">[02:47:31]</a>.

## Quintessence

Forest Mars was a true "G" – a genius with an unparalleled drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:20">[03:38:20]</a>. His pioneering [[business_strategies_and_history | strategies]] in the 1930s, including open-office structures, diversification into new industries, scientific management, and sophisticated marketing, were radical at the time but are now widely accepted as hallmarks of modern business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:21">[03:39:21]</a>. The [[history_of_mars_incorporated | company's]] enduring success, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 14% for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:07">[03:37:07]</a>, is a testament to the path-dependent nature of his foundational decisions and the unique circumstances he navigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:27">[03:40:27]</a>.

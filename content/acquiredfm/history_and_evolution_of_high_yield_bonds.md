Historically, a significant barrier to profitability in investment has been rigidity in approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This rigidity often manifested as a reluctance among most [[investment_strategies_for_high_yield_bonds | investment organizations]] to buy bonds rated below a certain threshold, typically A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Genesis of High Yield Investing

The concept of [[introduction_to_junk_bonds | high yield bonds]], also known as [[introduction_to_junk_bonds | junk bonds]], emerged from what was initially considered a "Backwater" area of finance, particularly within institutions like Citibank's bond department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. When tasked with understanding and starting a fund for [[introduction_to_junk_bonds | high yield bonds]], it was found that nearly everyone avoided them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This lack of competition, akin to having no other bidders at an auction, was recognized as a potential advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Open-mindedness and a willingness to [[evolution_of_markets_and_investment_strategies | evolve]] one's thinking were crucial for pioneering this investment area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Michael Milken's Early Insights

Michael Milken, graduating from Wharton in 1969, simultaneously with the speaker's graduation from Chicago, developed an early interest in low-rated bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His insight was reportedly influenced by a famous book called "Hickman," which analyzed bond experiences from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Milken discovered that the lower a bond's rating, the higher its actual rate of return was, not just its promised yield, but its realized total return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Despite the period including the Great Depression and some defaults, the excess yield offered by these bonds was more than sufficient to offset credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This was an "aha moment" that challenged conventional wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Initial Market Perception

At the time, it was almost impossible to issue a low-rated bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. These bonds were explicitly termed "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade," and major banks and underwriters avoided them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Moody's manual in 1978 defined a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment," implying they were unsuitable for investment regardless of price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### The Life Insurance Analogy

A pivotal realization came around 1981 or 1982, when a reporter questioned how one could invest in [[introduction_to_junk_bonds | high yield bonds]] knowing some would default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The immediate analogy that came to mind was life insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>:

*   **Aware Risk:** Like death, defaults are a known risk, not a shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Analyzable Risk:** Risks can be analyzed (e.g., medical checks for insurance policies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Diversifiable Risk:** Risk can be diversified across a portfolio (e.g., insuring diverse groups, not just skydivers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Well-Compensated Risk:** Investors are paid a premium for taking on these risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

This analogy explained how investing in [[introduction_to_junk_bonds | high yield bonds]]—even those of "worst [[the_evolution_of_venture_capital_and_public_markets | public companies]] in America"—could be steadily profitable and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Contrasting Investment Philosophies: High Yield vs. The Nifty Fifty

In the late 1960s, the dominant [[investment_strategies_for_high_yield_bonds | investment strategy]] focused on the "[[comparing_investment_approaches_high_yield_bonds_vs_blue_chip_stocks | Nifty Fifty]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. These were considered the best and fastest-growing companies, believed to be immune to negative events, and for which "there was no price too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

This was the polar opposite of the perception of [[introduction_to_junk_bonds | high yield bonds]], for which "there was no price low enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Both stances were ultimately incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Investors who bought the [[comparing_investment_approaches_high_yield_bonds_vs_blue_chip_stocks | Nifty Fifty]] in 1969 and held for five years lost nearly all their money, primarily because these companies were priced too high, with P/E ratios often between 60 and 90, compared to the S&P average of 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Failures Among the Nifty Fifty

While some [[comparing_investment_approaches_high_yield_bonds_vs_blue_chip_stocks | Nifty Fifty]] companies (like consumer and tobacco firms) fared better, many did not:

*   **IBM:** Despite the saying "you can't be fired for buying IBM," the company faced significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Xerox:** Lost its market to imports and had to find a new business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Patterns:** A consumer company whose business model became outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The concept of "disruption" was not considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>; "moats" were seen as inviolable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This oversight led to significant losses, with many companies experiencing more than 90% declines from their peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This stark contrast highlighted the importance of pricing and risk analysis, rather than simply investing in perceived "best" companies or outright dismissing "worst" ones.

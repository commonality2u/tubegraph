Following their success with [[founding_and_significance_of_linkabit_and_qualcomm | Linkabit]], Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi, along with five other top engineers from [[founding_and_significance_of_linkabit_and_qualcomm | Linkabit]], founded a new company in July 1985, which they named [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_market_influence | Qualcomm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The name "Qualcomm" is short for "Quality Communications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This choice reflected their belief that they could provide higher quality communications than anyone else, given their expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Background and Opportunity
[[founding_and_significance_of_linkabit_and_qualcomm | Linkabit]], which had developed a video scrambling system for pay TV on cable systems, was acquired by the East Coast radio technology company Macom in 1980 for $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. [[founding_and_significance_of_linkabit_and_qualcomm | Linkabit]] grew to 1,500 employees within Macom over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Jacobs and Viterbi remained with Macom for five years after the acquisition, but left in 1985 due to a leadership change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

At this time, the wireless communications industry was just beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, specifically the 1G analog cellular telephone industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Early cellular technology relied on car phones because of their high power requirements, often needing a running internal combustion engine to operate, and were very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Despite these limitations, consumer demand for car phones was immense, with years-long wait lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Bandwidth was severely limited because of inefficient analog communication methods, similar to FM radio, where adjacent frequencies would cause interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Jacobs and Viterbi, recognized as brilliant academics and astute business people, saw this nascent industry and its unmet demand as a massive opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. They believed they knew a better, digital way to vastly improve wireless communication efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Initial Strategy and Challenges
[[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_market_influence | Qualcomm]]'s founders identified two core tenets at the outset:
1.  **Massive Opportunity**: The goal was to apply their expertise to transition terrestrial cell phone networks into the digital era and build a dominant company in this burgeoning industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
2.  **Bootstrapping**: They understood they couldn't immediately jump into building the entire cellular network infrastructure, which required enormous capital expenditure (capex) and a multitude of competencies (real estate for towers, base stations, phone manufacturing, consumer branding, carrier relationships, government spectrum licensing, chip makers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Therefore, they decided to bootstrap by doing consulting work, similar to [[founding_and_significance_of_linkabit_and_qualcomm | Linkabit]]'s early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

The challenge was to figure out how much of the "elephant" (the entire cellular ecosystem) to "eat" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This strategic execution was described as one of the most brilliant market entries in business history, requiring perfectly threading many interdependent "needles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Development of CDMA and Key Patent
One of [[qualcomms_early_developments_in_communication_technology | Qualcomm]]'s first consulting projects was with Hughes, a defense contractor, on a proposal to the FCC for a mobile satellite network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. While working on optimizing satellite communication channels for efficiency, they applied spread spectrum technology to enable multiple conversations to access the same channels simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This led to the development of a technique called Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

In contrast to prior methods like Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), where each conversation got its own frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), which parceled information into digital packets and rotated time slots on a single frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, CDMA allowed all conversations to be sent simultaneously across all channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This was achieved by appending a unique digital code to each conversation, which could then be reassembled and decoded on the receiving end, akin to packet switching on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

The analogy used to explain CDMA is a dinner party where everyone communicates in their own language simultaneously; the listener, knowing the code, can disregard other "noise" and focus only on the intended message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This method offered a significantly more efficient way to use a given medium for maximum conversations or signal transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

Crucially, [[qualcomms_early_developments_in_communication_technology | Qualcomm]] developed and patented CDMA for terrestrial cellular networks in 1986, years before directly entering the cellular industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. U.S. Patent number 4,901,307 became one of the most valuable patents in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The value of this patent lay in its ability to allow multiple users to broadcast messages simultaneously on any available frequency, with the receiving technology decoding them, all while requiring less power, thereby improving battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. This early patenting of a core technology was a critical move in [[qualcomms_business_strategy_and_market_influence | Qualcomm]]'s long-term strategic game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

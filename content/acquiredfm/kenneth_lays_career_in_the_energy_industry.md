[[early_life_and_education_of_kenneth_lay | Kenneth Lay]] was born in rural Missouri in 1942, growing up very poor after his Baptist preacher father's general store failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. His family prioritized education, moving to Columbia, Missouri, so his older sister could attend the University of Missouri at Columbia while living at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Lay followed in her footsteps, also attending the University of Missouri where he developed a lifelong passion for economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. He was a star student in the economics department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

After graduating, Lay went on to work in the oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He completed a PhD in economics on nights and weekends while working in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. During the Vietnam War, he joined the Navy, serving as a naval intelligence officer, though he was never deployed for combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. At this point in his life, he was perceived as a "real good guy" and married his college sweetheart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Government Service and Return to Industry
In the mid-1970s, Lay received a call from his former professor at the University of Missouri, who had just been nominated to the Federal Power Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. With deregulation beginning to "percolate through the government," Lay was invited to join him in Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. He served as the Deputy Under Secretary of Energy in the Department of the Interior during a time of oil shocks and increasing discussion about deregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

After a few years in government, Lay returned to the private sector, becoming the president and number two operator at Florida Gas, a pipeline company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Innovation at Transco Energy
In 1982, Lay's former boss, who had moved to Transco Energy in Houston, Texas (the "Silicon Valley of the oil and gas sector"), recruited Lay to join him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Houston was considered the hub for anyone wanting to be in the American energy business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. While there, Lay left his first wife behind in Florida and moved to Houston with his new wife, who had been his secretary at Florida Gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Upon Lay's arrival at Transco, two significant things were happening:
1.  Deregulation was fully in swing, following the signing of the Energy Act by President Carter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
2.  Energy prices unexpectedly fell in 1982 for the first time in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Transco faced a crisis as it was contracted to buy oil and gas assets at ever-increasing prices, which contradicted the falling market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Lay, leveraging his PhD in economics and brilliant mind, proposed an innovative solution: setting up a trading market for oil and gas, particularly for natural gas which was sufficiently deregulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Instead of Transco buying gas from producers, the company would operate the pipelines and facilitate a market where end consumers (like factories and utilities) could directly trade with producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This created a "spot market for energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

This innovation was a "huge success" and made Lay an "industry legend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Before Lay's initiative at Transco, the concept of trading or financializing energy didn't widely exist due to government regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Lay's idea facilitated a direct market between producers and consumers, allowing for real-time pricing, a departure from the previous system of long-term contracts between pipelines and producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This initiative was considered the "opening of the floodgates" for future energy market innovations, and Lay was the ideal person to lead it due to his decade of industry experience, economics training, and government experience with deregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Leadership at Houston Natural Gas and the Merger with InterNorth
In June 1984, Lay was poached from his number two role at Transco to become the CEO of another major Houston energy company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. HNG was a significant publicly traded energy company, with an estimated market cap of around $1 to $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The following year, in 1985, Lay received a call from the CEO of InterNorth, a larger competitor based in Omaha, Nebraska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Despite its Omaha base, InterNorth was the largest pipeline company in America at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. InterNorth was being pursued by the 1980s corporate raider Irwin Jacobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. To thwart the hostile takeover, InterNorth's CEO proposed merging with HNG as a "poison pill" to create a combined company too large for Jacobs or other raiders to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

InterNorth acquired HNG for $2.3 billion, representing a 40% premium to HNG's stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Although InterNorth was the larger company, it became clear that Lay and the HNG team would largely run the show in the new combined entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Bethany McLean's account suggests InterNorth was "hoodwinked," paying a high price and conceding significant board seats and influence to HNG executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## The Birth of Enron and Jeffrey Skilling's Arrival
A significant culture clash emerged, particularly over the location of the new company's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. The InterNorth management and board wanted to keep it in Omaha, emphasizing political connections and job retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Lay, now a "Texas Oil Man" and a "player in the industry," had no interest in moving to Omaha and wanted to remain in Houston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. InterNorth possessed a "ridiculously valuable hard asset" in its 20,000 miles of pipeline, including Northern Natural, a major north-south line feeding gas from Texas into the Midwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

To resolve the headquarters dispute and justify their decision to the board, the management team hired McKinsey & Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This assignment landed on the desk of a young, "hot shot superstar Junior partner" in McKinsey's Houston office: [[brad_gerstners_career_and_entrepreneurial_background | Jeffrey Skilling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Skilling, a Baker Scholar (top 5% of his class) from Harvard Business School, was famously blunt, once telling the HBS dean he was "effing smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

Skilling presented his findings to the board in Omaha, concluding that the company should be based in Houston, as it made strategic sense for the largest pipeline company in the world to be in the energy hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. At the time, natural gas was gaining perception as a "pseudo clean energy" and the "next great Frontier," offering advantages over oil (due to OPEC and foreign dependence) and having favorable properties for storage and transport, making it an ideal asset for a free market enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

At this fateful board meeting in 1985 or 1986, the prior CEO of InterNorth was fired, and Lay engineered a coup, becoming the CEO of the combined company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Although the headquarters move didn't happen immediately (the board initially insisted on Omaha), it did occur shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This meeting marked the first encounter between [[the_beginnings_of_enron_and_kenneth_lays_role_as_ceo | Kenneth Lay]] and Jeffrey Skilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Lay, in his diplomatic style, apologized for the drama, praised Skilling's work, and asked him to be McKinsey's lead partner for the combined company's strategic initiatives in Houston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. And so, [[the_beginnings_of_enron_and_kenneth_lays_role_as_ceo | it began]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. The merged company was soon renamed [[the_beginnings_of_enron_and_kenneth_lays_role_as_ceo | Enron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

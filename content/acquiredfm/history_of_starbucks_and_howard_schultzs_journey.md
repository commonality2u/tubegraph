Starbucks has evolved from a small chain selling coffee beans to a global institution with over 39,000 stores in 80 countries, holding approximately $1.7 billion in unspent gift card balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Its remarkable growth and influence are largely attributed to the vision and relentless drive of [[Founder stories and historical business lessons | Howard Schultz]], who transformed the company into the renowned "third place" it is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Starbucks 1.0: The Origin Story
Starbucks was initially founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker, opening its first store in Seattle's Pike Place Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. The founders were inspired by Peet's Coffee in the Bay Area, pioneered by Alfred Peet, who brought specialty Arabica coffee to Northern California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. Initially, Starbucks exclusively sold roasted coffee beans and coffee-making equipment, not brewed beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. They even used Peet's Coffee beans in their early days before roasting their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

At the time, American coffee culture was "di minimist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>, dominated by low-grade Robusta beans used for instant coffee, a product popularized after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. Starbucks, however, focused on high-grade Arabica coffee, educating customers on its taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. Despite having only three stores, the company gained a disproportionate reputation through word-of-mouth and a mail-order business that shipped small amounts of fresh beans to tourists who visited Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

## Howard Schultz Enters the Scene
In 1982, Howard Schultz, then working for a Swedish housewares company called Hammerplast, discovered Starbucks as a customer of his company's non-electric coffee maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Intrigued by the experience at the Pike Place store, Schultz was "blown away by the romance of coffee, the education" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. He lobbied Jerry Baldwin, the CEO, and eventually joined Starbucks in 1982 as head of marketing, just as the company was preparing to open its fourth store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. His ambition extended "well beyond Portland Oregon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>, the founders' initial expansion goal.

Schultz's background instilled in him a deep drive for more than just a stable job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. Growing up in public housing projects with a "dysfunctional family" due to financial pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>, he wanted to build "a different kind of company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. His previous job at Xerox, which required 50 cold calls a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>, taught him "incredible amounts about not only selling but humility" due to daily rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. A "three" rating on his Xerox performance review solidified his desire to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

### The Italian Epiphany
In 1983, Schultz visited Milan for a housewares trade show and was captivated by the thriving Italian coffee bar scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>. He immediately recognized that this was the "business that Starbucks has to be in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>. The experience felt like moving from a "black and white movie" into "color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. Upon returning, he urged Baldwin and Gordon Bowker to introduce brewed coffee, but they resisted, not wanting to enter the "restaurant business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.

After two years of persistence, Schultz was finally allowed to open a small coffee bar section (100 square feet) within the sixth Starbucks store in Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>. This venture, which served lattes and cappuccinos, quickly attracted 500 customers a week, significantly more than the 200-300 customers typically buying coffee beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>. Despite its success, the founders remained unconvinced, citing concerns about cleanliness and the nature of the restaurant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>.

## Il Giornale and the Acquisition of Starbucks
Frustrated, Schultz left Starbucks in 1985 to start his own coffee bar company, Il Giornale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>. Starbucks became an investor, hoping he would continue to sell their coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. Raising capital was a significant challenge; he spoke to 242 investors, with 217 saying no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:34:00">[39:34:00]</a>. Even Italian coffee giants like Faema and Lavazza turned him down, believing "no one is going to buy Italian espresso in Seattle or in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:10]</a>. Schultz went without a salary for nearly two years while his wife was pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>, facing humiliation from his father-in-law who called his venture a "hobby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>.

His break came when three prominent Seattle citizens – Jack Behroya, Herman Sarkowsky, and Sam Strong – invested, helping him raise the initial $1.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>. Il Giornale opened three successful stores: two in Seattle and one in Vancouver, BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>. Schultz observed that these small, standing-room-only shops fostered a "sense of community and human connection," creating the concept of the "third place" outside of home and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>.

Meanwhile, the original Starbucks faced financial trouble after acquiring Peet's Coffee, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 6:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. Jerry Baldwin decided to sell Starbucks and move to California with Peet's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. He offered Schultz the opportunity to buy Starbucks for $3.8 million, giving him 90 days to raise the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>. Schultz was raising money when he learned that one of his own investors, Sam Strong, had made a secret all-cash offer to buy Starbucks, which would have left Schultz out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>.

In a pivotal moment, Schultz's friend, attorney Scott Greenberg, arranged a meeting with his senior partner, Bill Gates Sr. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>. Gates Sr. confronted Sam Strong, declaring, "Howard Schultz is going to acquire Starbucks Coffee Company and he's never going to hear from you again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>. Gates Sr. and his son (Bill Gates II) then helped Schultz raise the necessary funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:14:00">[35:14:00]</a>. The deal closed in August 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>. Il Giornale was rebranded as Starbucks Corporation, acquiring the six existing Starbucks stores, bringing the total to 11 stores and 100 employees in the Northwest by the end of 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:00">[38:35:00]</a>. The original Starbucks founders subsequently rebranded their remaining business as Peet's Coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:00">[39:17:00]</a>.

## Business Model and Early Growth
The new Starbucks, under Schultz, focused on the highly profitable beverage business, achieving an "80% gross margin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>. The economic model for new stores was a 2:1 sales-to-investment ratio and over 20% operating profit, leading to cash-on-cash returns within 1.5 to 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>. This model was revolutionary in retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:17:00]</a>.

Key innovations and decisions during this period included:
*   **Customer Customization**: Customers began asking for personalized beverages, which increased average ticket prices and enhanced loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:28:00">[44:28:00]</a>. The mobile app later added "velocity to customization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>, with up to 100,000 different drink variations being made consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:20:00">[44:24:20]</a>.
*   **The Iconic Cup**: Schultz insisted on developing a new paper cup and sip-through lid to replace the Styrofoam cups, which affected taste and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31:00">[45:31:00]</a>. This iconic cup became a "badge of honor" and a "free billboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:29:00">[49:29:00]</a>. Schultz regretted not trademarking "cafe latte" or the sip lid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47:00">[46:47:00]</a>.
*   **Drink Sizing**: The unique "Short, Tall, Grande, Venti" sizing was introduced to create a distinctive language around the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:35:00">[47:35:00]</a>.
*   **Names on Cups**: Employees spontaneously started writing names on cups to manage busy orders, which became a standard practice and enhanced customer intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>.

Schultz consciously pursued an "experiential brand at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:18:00">[49:18:00]</a> without spending any money on marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:27:00">[49:27:00]</a>.

## Rapid Expansion and the H2O Era
Schultz's ambition was evident early on; in a 1988 employee meeting, he declared Starbucks would grow from 11 stores to 26 in one year and over 100 in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[53:30:00]</a>, a goal he achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:41:00">[54:41:00]</a>. This period saw the formation of the "H2O era" leadership team: Howard Schultz (vision/ambition), Howard Behar (soul/servant [[Leadership and cultural legacy at Starbucks | leadership]]), and Orin Smith (the "adult in the room" for financial acumen and wisdom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:25:00">[56:25:00]</a>. They famously had dinner together every Monday night for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:31:00">[57:37:00]</a>.

Early expansion was cautious; after fixing initial struggles in Chicago, Starbucks expanded to Los Angeles, a decision Schultz strongly advocated for due to its "halo" effect and potential for celebrity adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:00:00">[59:00:00]</a>. Starbucks remained committed to being accessible to all, aiming for "affordable luxury" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.

### The Power of People: A Core Value
Central to Starbucks's success was its unwavering focus on its employees, whom Schultz called "partners." This philosophy stemmed from his desire to build a company that provided "respect and dignity" for its workforce, a stark contrast to his father's experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.

Key initiatives included:
*   **Bean Stock**: In 1991, the year before its IPO, Starbucks began giving stock options (Bean Stock) to every employee, including part-time workers (working 20+ hours), making it the first company to offer such a program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>. This decision, initially resisted by venture capitalists on the board, significantly enhanced performance and lowered attrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. An initial grant of $6 per share in 1991 would be worth 800 times that today due to stock splits and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: In 1988, Starbucks began offering comprehensive healthcare benefits to part-time employees, including gay couples in domestic partnerships, 25 years before the Affordable Care Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. This was driven by Schultz's own experience of his family having no health insurance during his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **College Achievement Plan**: Starbucks partnered with Arizona State University to offer free four-year college tuition to all partners, a program that has seen thousands of employees graduate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:41">[02:52:41]</a>.

This commitment to people fostered a culture of "compassion, empathy and love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>, which Schultz believes is the underlying reason for Starbucks's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:40">[02:26:40]</a>. This "humanity" allowed Starbucks to grow and maintain its unique culture, even in diverse global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>. The average employee tenure at Starbucks is twice that of the industry average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:19">[02:52:19]</a>.

## IPO and Continued Growth
Starbucks went public in 1992, becoming the first publicly traded coffee company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>. The IPO price was $17, opening at $21, with a market cap of $250 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. This was considered a "small cap IPO," with revenue of $93 million that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. Goldman Sachs initially turned them down for being "too small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.

Starbucks also pursued partnerships for brand exposure and distribution:
*   **Costco**: Despite internal "revolt," Starbucks began selling its beans in Costco stores nationwide. This led to increased store traffic for Starbucks, demonstrating how selling beans enhanced awareness for their beverage business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. Notably, Jeff Brotman, Costco's co-founder, was an early investor and board member in Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.
*   **United Airlines**: Becoming the official coffee of United Airlines was initially met with "blasphemy" internally but provided vast exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   **Barnes & Noble**: Starbucks opened cafes inside Barnes & Noble bookstores, a natural extension of the "third place" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
*   **Frappuccino**: In 1994, Starbucks acquired The Coffee Connection in Boston, which owned the trademark for "Frappuccino" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. Schultz initially "looked at that with disdain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>, not liking the blended cold drink, but it became immensely popular, accounting for 7% of revenue by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>.
*   **Bottled Frappuccino**: In 1995, Schultz pitched a bottled Frappuccino to Coca-Cola (who dismissed him) and Pepsi, resulting in a 50/50 joint venture that became a multi-billion dollar business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a>.

## [[Impact of global expansion and customizations at Starbucks | International Expansion]]
Starbucks's international expansion, starting with Japan in 1996, was a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a>. Despite a consultant's report advising against it due to cultural differences (smoking, no street-coffee culture) and economic concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">[01:30:41]</a>, Schultz pushed forward. Starbucks formed a joint venture with a Japanese company founded by Eugis Son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:40">[01:31:40]</a>. The first store in Tokyo's Ginza district was an "extraordinary success from minute one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:47">[01:34:47]</a>, driven by anticipation and Starbucks's iconic reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. By 1999, Starbucks had crossed 2,000 stores globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:46">[01:37:46]</a>.

### [[Impact of global expansion and customizations at Starbucks | China Market]]
Starbucks entered China in 1999, initially with a partner that "did not share our values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:53">[01:37:53]</a>. After struggling for a decade and losing money, Starbucks bought out the partner and became company-owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. The turnaround is credited to Belinda Wong, who became the head of China operations. Wong decentralized decision-making, allowing local teams to customize menus and operations (e.g., breakfast offerings) rather than being dictated by Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>. She also pioneered health insurance for partners' parents and grandparents, a move that impressed the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:12">[02:18:12]</a>. China now accounts for 18% of Starbucks's revenue, with nearly 7,000 stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:53">[02:27:53]</a>.

### [[Impact of global expansion and customizations at Starbucks | Entry into Italy]]
Despite his inspiration for the coffee bar concept coming from Italy, Starbucks did not enter the Italian market for 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>. Schultz believed they had to "earn the right" to enter, waiting until they could present themselves in the best possible way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:09">[03:32:09]</a>. This opportunity arose with The Roastery concept.

### The Roastery Concept
The Roastery, envisioned as a "Willy Wonka" experience, is Starbucks's "most entrepreneurial, creative project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:53">[03:32:53]</a>. There are six Roasteries globally (Seattle, Chicago, New York, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Milan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, designed to be a "dynamic, entertaining vehicle of theater, romance, seduction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:50">[03:40:50]</a>. They act as a "billboard" for the brand, elevating Starbucks's image and countering its "ubiquity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:11">[02:40:11]</a>.

The Milan Roastery opened in 2018 in a former post office building, secured through Schultz's direct call to Blackstone's John Gray, who owned the property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. In Italy, espresso is Starbucks's number one beverage, indicating acceptance by locals, not just tourists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:7:29">[03:07:29]</a>.

## [[Challenges and transformations in Starbucks operations | Leadership Transitions and Turnarounds]]
In 2000, Schultz stepped down as CEO, becoming executive chairman, citing exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:11">[01:41:11]</a>. Orin Smith became CEO, followed by Jim Donald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. By 2008, Starbucks faced a "tumultuous pandemic era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, with a plummeting stock price, declining same-store sales, and internal "cracks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>. The market cap had dropped from $30 billion to under $7 billion, and the company was reportedly seven months from insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:38">[01:44:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.

Schultz returned as CEO in 2008, embarking on a major turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:21">[01:44:21]</a>. He made difficult decisions, including closing 1,000 underperforming stores and laying off employees, publicly apologizing to staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:11">[01:45:11]</a>. He held a pivotal meeting with 10,000 store managers in New Orleans, openly discussing the company's precarious financial situation and rallying them to focus on individual store performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a>. Tactics included closing stores for an afternoon to retrain baristas on coffee purity, which had been diluted by previous efficiency efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:41">[01:50:41]</a>. The turnaround was "wildly successful," with profits soaring from $315 million in 2008 to $945 million by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>.

A notable piece of advice during this period came from Steve Jobs, who told Schultz to "fire everyone on your leadership team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">[01:57:11]</a>. While Schultz didn't fire everyone immediately, his entire leadership team turned over within nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:36">[01:57:36]</a>.

### [[Challenges and transformations in Starbucks operations | Technology Adoption]]
Starbucks was an early adopter of mobile ordering, launching its app around 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:07">[01:59:07]</a>. Today, 33% of Starbucks orders are placed via mobile order and pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:14">[01:58:14]</a>. While this created "unbelievable convenience" and a more efficient business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:23">[02:00:23]</a>, Schultz sees it as the company's "biggest Achilles heel" today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:08">[02:00:08]</a>. The focus on efficiency and speed has "deteriorated" the "third place" experience, leading to "mosh pits" at pickup counters and depersonalizing the connection between barista and customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:53">[02:00:53]</a>. He believes Starbucks needs to prioritize enhancing the experience over pure economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:25">[02:08:25]</a>.

### Recent Challenges and Future Outlook
Schultz again stepped down as CEO in 2017, with Kevin Johnson taking over until 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>. Schultz returned as interim CEO for a year, then Laxman Narasimhan became CEO in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:44">[02:21:44]</a>.

In recent years, Starbucks has faced renewed challenges, including labor unionization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:58">[02:05:58]</a> and declining same-store sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Schultz believes the company made "early mistakes" in handling these issues and "underestimated the ground swell of public sentiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:41">[02:23:41]</a>.

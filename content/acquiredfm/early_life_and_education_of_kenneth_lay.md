[[the_beginnings_of_enron_and_kenneth_lays_role_as_ceo | Kenneth Lee Lay]], the future CEO of Enron, was born in rural Missouri in 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. His father was a Baptist preacher who also ran a general store in the Missouri countryside, which eventually failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Lay grew up in poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, but his family prioritized education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

To enable his older sister to attend the University of Missouri at Columbia and live at home, the entire family relocated to Columbia, Missouri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Lay later followed in his sister's footsteps, attending the University of Missouri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. There, he discovered a lifelong passion for economics, becoming a star student in the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

After graduating, Lay began his [[kenneth_lays_career_in_the_energy_industry | career in the oil industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. While working full-time, he pursued and completed a PhD in economics by studying on nights and weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. During the Vietnam War, he also served in the Navy as a naval intelligence officer, though he was never deployed for combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. By outward appearances, Lay seemed like a "real good guy," having married his college sweetheart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

In the mid-1970s, Lay's former economics advisor from the University of Missouri, who had been nominated to the Federal Power Commission, contacted him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. With energy deregulation beginning to take hold, Lay was invited to Washington D.C. to help navigate the intersection of government and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. He served as the Deputy Undersecretary of Energy in the Department of the Interior during a period of oil shocks and increasing deregulation discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

After a few years in government, Lay transitioned back into the private sector, becoming the president and number two operator at Florida Gas, a pipeline company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This marked him as a "real deal" â€” a PhD Economist with experience as a civil servant and exposure to D.C., now gaining operating experience in the industry after growing up in adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was a key executive at this natural gas pipeline company in Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

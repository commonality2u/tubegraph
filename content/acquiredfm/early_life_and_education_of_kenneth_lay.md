Kenneth Lee Lay, a central figure in the [[the_formation_and_impact_of_enron | Enron]] story, was born in rural Missouri in 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. His father, a Baptist preacher, operated a general store in the Missouri countryside that eventually failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Lay grew up in very poor conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Education and Family Values

Despite their poverty, Lay's family prioritized education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. When his older sister graduated high school, the family moved to Columbia, Missouri, so she could live at home and afford to attend the University of Missouri at Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. [[kenneth_lays_career_milestones_and_achievements | Kenneth Lay]] would later follow in her footsteps, attending the same university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

It was at the University of Missouri that Lay discovered a lifelong passion for economics, becoming a star student in the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. After graduating, he went on to complete a PhD in economics, working in the oil industry during nights and weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Early Career and Government Service

In the mid-1970s, Lay received a call from his former professor and advisor from Missouri, who had been nominated to the Federal Power Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. As deregulation began to gain traction in the government, Lay's former advisor invited him to Washington D.C. to help navigate these changes with the government and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Lay served as the Deputy Under Secretary of Energy in the Department of the Interior during a period of oil shocks and increasing discussion about deregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. After a few years, he returned to the industry, becoming the president and number two operator at Florida Gas, a pipeline company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

At this point in his career, Lay was perceived as a "real deal": a PhD economist, a civil servant with government experience, and an industry professional with operating experience, who had overcome adversity in his upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. He also served in the Navy during Vietnam as a naval intelligence officer, though he was never deployed for combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. By all outward appearances, he seemed a "real good guy," having married his college sweetheart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Transition to Houston and Personal Changes

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Lay was the second-highest executive at Florida Gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. In 1982, his former boss at Transco Energy, a major player in the energy industry based in Houston, invited him to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Houston was considered the "Silicon Valley" or "New York City" of the oil and gas sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Lay's move to Houston marked his entry into the "big time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Unfortunately, he left his wife behind in Florida and moved to Houston with his new wife, who had been his secretary at Florida Gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Pioneering Energy Trading at Transco

Upon Lay's arrival at Transco in 1982, two significant events were unfolding: deregulation was fully impacting the industry following Carter's Energy Act, and energy prices unexpectedly fell for the first time in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transco faced a problem with contracts to buy oil and gas at increasing prices, leaving them in a difficult position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Leveraging his PhD in economics, Lay proposed an innovative solution: setting up a trading market for oil and gas, particularly natural gas, which was sufficiently deregulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Instead of the pipeline company buying all the gas from producers, Transco would operate the pipelines and create a spot market, allowing end consumers (like factories and utilities) to trade directly with producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

This initiative was a "huge success" and a "massive innovation," establishing Lay as an industry legend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Before Transco and Lay, the idea of trading or financialization of oil and gas barely existed due to government regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. While not yet "securitization of energy assets," it was the first time a market was made for producers and consumers to buy and sell energy on the spot market at real-time prices, moving away from long-term contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Lay's unique combination of industry experience, economics training, and government exposure made him the "perfect person" to open these floodgates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Ascent to CEO at Houston Natural Gas (HNG)

Building on this success, in June 1984, Lay, then the number two at Transco, was poached by Houston Natural Gas (HNG) to become its CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. HNG was a publicly traded energy company in Houston with a market cap of around $1 billion to $1.5 billion, marking a significant promotion for Lay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## The InterNorth Merger and Jeffrey Skilling

In 1985, Lay received a call from the CEO of InterNorth, a larger competitor based in Omaha, Nebraska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Despite its Omaha base, InterNorth was the largest pipeline company in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. InterNorth was being pursued by the 1980s corporate raider, [[Erwin Mark Jacobs early life and education | Irwin Jacobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The InterNorth CEO proposed merging with HNG as a "poison pill" to create a combined company too large for Jacobs or other raiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

InterNorth acquired HNG for $2.3 billion, a 40% premium to its stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. While InterNorth was the larger company, it soon became clear that Lay and the HNG team would be running the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Bethany McLean noted that InterNorth seemed "hoodwinked," paying a lot but inadvertently giving HNG significant board seats and executive influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. InterNorth possessed a "ridiculously valuable hard asset" in its Northern Natural pipeline, feeding gas from Texas into the Midwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

A major cultural clash emerged over the headquarters location, with the InterNorth team wanting Omaha and Lay wanting Houston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. To justify their decision to the board, they hired McKinsey & Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This assignment landed on the desk of a young, "hot shot superstar Junior partner" at McKinsey's Houston office: Jeffrey Skilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

Skilling, who joined McKinsey after Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, had a notable reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. He famously told the dean of Harvard Business School during his interview, "I'm effing smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Skilling's findings concluded that the company should be based in Houston, as it made strategic sense for the world's largest pipeline company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

During this period, natural gas was perceived as a "good guy" energy source, a "pseudo clean energy" alternative to "dirty big oil and coal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. It was the first part of the energy industry to be deregulated sufficiently for innovation and was favored in America due to concerns about dependence on foreign oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Natural gas also had practical advantages like easy pipelining and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

## Lay's Engineered Coup and Partnership with Skilling

At a fateful board meeting in Omaha, likely in 1985 or 1986, Lay engineered a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. The prior CEO of the merged company was fired, and Lay became the new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Although Skilling was there to present his headquarters findings, the board prioritized Omaha, and Lay, the "consummate politician," chose not to press the issue immediately after securing his new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

This meeting marked the first time Lay and Skilling met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. After the meeting, Lay diplomatically apologized to Skilling for the drama, praised his work on the study, and expressed his desire to continue the relationship with McKinsey, asking Skilling to be their lead McKinsey partner for future strategic initiatives in Houston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. "And so it begins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ([[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]]) is widely regarded as one of the most critical companies in the modern world, especially within the [[semiconductor industry overview | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Dominance in Leading-Edge Manufacturing
[[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] has become the sole manufacturer of leading-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. They produce the primary chip found in every MacBook and iPhone shipped today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Beyond consumer devices, [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] is crucial to the current AI wave, manufacturing all of Nvidia's chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Their client list also includes other major "fabulous" companies like Qualcomm, AMD, Broadcom, and hyperscalers such as AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Interestingly, they also manufacture many chips for Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Having dominated the smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] continues its role as a manufacturing superpower in the current AI era (as of 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Market Capitalization and Global Standing
Since 2021, [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]]'s market cap has doubled from $550 billion to over $1 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It stands as one of only two trillion-dollar companies outside the U.S. West Coast, the other being Saudi Aramco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. As of 2021, [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] was the ninth-largest company in the world by market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### The Global Chip Shortage
The global reliance on [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] has been underscored by the global chip shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This shortage has had a massive impact on various industries, including the automotive sector, with Ford pausing F-150 production due to chip scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## [[Morris Changs leadership and decisions at TSMC | Founding and Business Model Innovation]]
[[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] was founded by [[Morris Changs leadership and decisions at TSMC | Morris Chang]] at the age of 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The company's origins are deeply intertwined with the development of the semiconductor industry itself.

### The Birth of the Pure-Play Foundry
[[Morris Changs leadership and decisions at TSMC | Morris Chang]]'s pivotal insight came from observing the challenges faced by integrated circuit designers who wanted to start their own businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. The major impediment was the enormous capital required to build and operate semiconductor manufacturing plants (Fabs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

Before [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]], the prevailing wisdom in the semiconductor industry was that "real men have Fabs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>, meaning that successful semiconductor companies designed, manufactured, and marketed their own chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>. The idea of a "pure-play foundry" – a company solely dedicated to manufacturing chips for others without designing its own – was initially seen as a "solution looking for a problem" because there wasn't a clear market for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>.

However, [[Morris Changs leadership and decisions at TSMC | Chang]]'s vision was to create a company that would enable the emergence of "fabulous" (fabless) chip design companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. He essentially became the "world's best semiconductor VC," indexing on the entire future of innovation and entrepreneurship in semiconductors by providing the manufacturing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>. This model allowed fabless startups like Qualcomm, Broadcom, Marvell, and Nvidia to be founded with significantly less capital, as they did not need to build their own Fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. Nvidia, for example, only ever raised $20 million and built its business entirely with [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.

### Initial Challenges and Government Support
[[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] was founded in 1987 with a pre-money valuation of zero, meaning [[Morris Changs leadership and decisions at TSMC | Morris Chang]] received no equity at the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. The Taiwanese government initially provided 50% of the $220 million total capital, with Philips contributing 28% and other Taiwanese business leaders "strong-armed" by the premier to invest the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.

For its first few years, [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] had to survive by taking "the dregs" – overflow or unprofitable manufacturing orders – from larger integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>. These orders were unstable and often unprofitable, as IDMs would pull them back once their own capacity returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

### The Flywheel Effect and Technological Leadership
The emergence of the fabless industry created an "insane flywheel" for [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>. As the fabless market grew, [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]]'s revenue increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>. Their high operating margins (40% as a contract manufacturer) allowed them to invest heavily in capital expenditure (capex) to build more Fabs and advance their manufacturing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. This continuous advancement enabled them to produce better chips with smaller process lengths, which in turn allowed their fabless customers to achieve better performance, grow larger, and attract new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. This virtuous cycle further fueled [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]]'s growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

This [[role_of_technology_choices_and_supplier_relationships_in_semiconductor_advancements | technological leadership]] is critical. In the early 2000s, 22 companies were at the leading edge of semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. By the late 2000s, this dropped to 14, and by the mid-2010s, only six remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. Today, at the 5-nanometer process node, only [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] and Samsung are capable, with [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] holding over 90% market share in leading-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:04">[01:48:04]</a>. [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] is poised to be the sole manufacturer at the upcoming 3-nanometer process, as Samsung's launch has slipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>.

This rapid consolidation is a testament to "Moore's Law," which states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years, and "Rock's Law" (also known as Moore's Second Law), which states that the cost of a semiconductor chip fabrication plant doubles every four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>. These two laws combined imply a winner-take-all scenario, where the most profitable company can continually reinvest in exponentially more expensive Fabs, making it impossible for competitors to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.

### The Mobile and Cloud Eras
[[Morris Changs leadership and decisions at TSMC | Morris Chang]] returned from retirement in 2009 at age 78 to lead [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] again, citing "golden opportunities ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>. These opportunities were the rise of mobile computing (smartphones) and the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>.

The iPhone, launched in 2007, initially used off-the-shelf Samsung chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a>. However, as the smartphone market exploded, Apple began designing its own chips (Apple Silicon) based on its acquisition of PA Semi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>. In 2010, [[Morris Changs leadership and decisions at TSMC | Chang]] secured a deal with Apple, a significant risk for both companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:09">[01:40:09]</a>. Apple was relying on [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]], then seen as an "also-ran," with "no backup plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>. For [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]], it meant a $9 billion initial investment and dedicating 6,000 employees to building a plant specifically for Apple in 11 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:09">[01:40:09]</a>. By the iPhone 6 (2013-2014), all iPhones were solely fabbed by [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>.

The rise of cloud computing also shifted demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>. While early cloud workloads favored Intel's x86 CPUs, the growth of AI and specialized workloads (like GPUs for parallel processing) shifted the focus to custom chips, which [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] was perfectly positioned to manufacture for hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.

## [[Role of technology choices and supplier relationships in semiconductor advancements | Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities]]
[[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]]'s ability to stay at the cutting edge relies on highly specialized equipment. They are the primary customer of ASML, a Dutch company that manufactures the world's most advanced chip-making machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>. These machines, especially those used for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, are incredibly complex:
*   They cost $200-300 million each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.
*   It takes four 747 planes to ship one machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>.
*   ASML crews are on-site to assemble and help run them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>.
*   The EUV process involves dropping molten tin and hitting it with a specialized laser 50,000 times per second to create plasma, which then generates extreme ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:23">[01:26:23]</a>. The accuracy required is more precise than calculations for the Apollo missions to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>.
*   ASML had to invent new mirrors to handle the EUV light, as it is absorbed by all known mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>.
*   Only 50 such machines are made per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>, and former competitors like Nikon have given up trying to compete in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

This "alchemy" of manufacturing is why [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] maintains its dominant position and high margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.

## [[TSMCs geopolitical and technological risks | Geopolitical Significance]]
[[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]]'s location in Taiwan, an island with disputed sovereignty claims from the People's Republic of China, presents a significant geopolitical risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The concentration of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing in this region is a major concern for global governments, particularly the U.S., which recognizes the critical importance of access to advanced chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:16">[02:22:16]</a>.

The U.S. has lobbied the Netherlands to restrict ASML from selling its most advanced equipment to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>. While China is investing heavily in its own foundries (like SMIC), replicating [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]]'s capabilities is incredibly difficult due to the decades of accumulated engineering know-how and the extreme complexity of the manufacturing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:37">[02:22:37]</a>.

To mitigate [[TSMCs geopolitical and technological risks | geopolitical risks]] and respond to government incentives, [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] is investing in new Fabs outside Taiwan, including a $12 billion plant in Arizona (which will not produce their most advanced chips) and a new Fab in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:30">[02:01:30]</a>. However, [[Morris Changs leadership and decisions at TSMC | Morris Chang]] has indicated that economically, it makes the most sense to keep the leading-edge manufacturing in Taiwan due to the established ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:16">[02:02:16]</a>.

## Financial Performance and Outlook
Since its Taiwan IPO in 1994, [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] has achieved a compound annual revenue growth of 17.4% for 27 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:05">[01:45:05]</a>. Its market cap has grown at a 19.9% internal rate of return (IRR) over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:30">[01:45:30]</a>.

In 2020, [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] had an operating profit of $20 billion on $48 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>. They reinvested $17 billion into capex that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>. They have announced plans to spend $100 billion in capex over three years, with $30 billion planned for 2021 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:09">[01:42:09]</a>.

The company has significant pricing power, having announced price increases (up to 20%) after years of price reductions, signaling their unique competitive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>. This ability to command higher prices further fuels their capacity for massive capital reinvestment, ensuring they maintain their lead in the semiconductor race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:35">[01:47:35]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Unique Business Model and Unparalleled Moat
[[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]] represents a unique case in the business world, particularly in the context of [[global_semiconductor_industry_evolution_and_tsmcs_role | global semiconductor industry evolution and TSMC's role]]. While it operates in the B2B hardware space, its business model exhibits elements of software-like operating leverage, where massive fixed costs in Fabs lead to high gross margins and immense profitability once scale is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>.

This combination of [[comparison_of_tsmcs_business_model_to_competitors | counter-positioning]], [[comparison_of_tsmcs_business_model_to_competitors | scale economies]], and unparalleled [[role_of_technology_choices_and_supplier_relationships_in_semiconductor_advancements | process power]] creates an almost impenetrable moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:07">[02:20:07]</a>. The technical difficulty, the decades of learning, and the proprietary know-how required to operate at the cutting edge of manufacturing mean that no amount of money can simply replicate [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]]'s capabilities overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:37">[02:22:37]</a>.

Absent a complete paradigm shift in computing technology, like a new substrate or a fundamentally different, significantly cheaper manufacturing method (e.g., Quantum Computing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:52">[01:57:52]</a>, [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company | TSMC]]'s dominance appears secure, making it arguably the most successful and important B2B hardware company of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:38">[02:18:38]</a>.

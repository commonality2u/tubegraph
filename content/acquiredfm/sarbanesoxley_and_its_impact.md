The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) was a landmark piece of legislation enacted in response to major corporate and accounting scandals, most notably the collapse of [[Enron collapse and bankruptcy | Enron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. Before SOX, the system allowed for significant exploitation of accounting loopholes, leaving it vulnerable to fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>.

## Background: The Need for Reform
Prior to SOX, numerous issues within corporate financial reporting and governance facilitated fraudulent activities:
*   **Special Purpose Entities (SPEs)**: Companies could remove assets and liabilities from their consolidated accounting books if just 3% of the capital in an SPE came from outside investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. This loophole allowed [[Enron business practices | Enron]] to hide massive debts and losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>.
*   **Lack of Financial Transparency**: It was possible for companies like [[Enron business practices | Enron]] to not maintain a central ledger of all their debt obligations, leading to a complete lack of understanding of their true financial state by even their own CFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>.
*   **Auditor Conflicts of Interest**: Accounting firms like Arthur Andersen, [[Enron business practices | Enron]]'s auditor, were also providing consulting services to their audit clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>. This created immense pressure to keep clients happy, even if it meant overlooking questionable accounting practices. Arthur Andersen was [[Enron business practices | Enron]]'s biggest client, generating $50 million a year, half from audit/tax and half from consulting fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.
*   **Incentive Misalignment**: Executive compensation and bonuses were often tied directly to stock price performance rather than the company's intrinsic financial health, incentivizing manipulative practices to inflate stock values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:59">[02:08:59]</a>.

The immediate catalyst for SOX was the revelation of widespread fraud at [[Enron collapse and bankruptcy | Enron]], including the destruction of documents by its auditor, Arthur Andersen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:16">[02:14:16]</a>. This document shredding, amounting to a ton of paper daily for weeks, ultimately led to Arthur Andersen losing its CPA license and going out of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:31">[02:15:31]</a>.

## Passage of the Act
On July 30, 2002, President George W. Bush signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act into law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:51">[02:37:51]</a>. The legislation was pushed through Congress remarkably quickly and with near-unanimous support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. It passed the House with 423 votes in favor, 3 opposed, and 8 abstaining, and the Senate with 99-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:10">[02:38:10]</a>.

## Key Provisions of SOX
SOX introduced a comprehensive set of reforms designed to put "a lid on the cookie jar" of corporate fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:49">[02:38:49]</a>. Key provisions include:
*   **CEO/CFO Certification**: Top management, specifically the CEO and CFO, are now required to personally certify the accuracy of their company's financial information, creating huge personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:01">[02:39:01]</a>.
*   **Penalties for Fraud**: The Act introduced more severe penalties for corporate fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:05">[02:39:05]</a>.
*   **Evidence Tampering**: New restrictions were placed on tampering with or destroying evidence, making it a felony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:08">[02:39:08]</a>. This provision was notably used to prosecute individuals involved in the January 6 riots, as they were seen to be impeding an official proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:07">[02:40:07]</a>.
*   **Auditor Independence**: To prevent conflicts of interest, accounting firms were mandated to spin off their consulting practices, ensuring greater independence for external auditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>.
*   **Increased Disclosures**: Public companies are now required to provide increased disclosures, including all off-balance sheet entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:23">[02:39:23]</a>.

## Impact and Legacy
SOX significantly increased the cost and complexity of being a public company in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:57">[02:39:57]</a>. This has been cited as a major factor contributing to the "stay private longer" trend, where companies delay or avoid [[Public market innovations and IPOs | IPOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:33">[02:38:33]</a>.

While SOX aimed to protect the American investing public from fraud in public markets, its impact has also led to a shift in where large-scale financial malfeasance occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:48">[03:21:48]</a>. Fraud is now potentially more likely to occur in private markets, as seen with cases like Theranos and [[FTX and Regulatory Compliance | FTX]] and other cryptocurrency-related incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Despite pushing companies away from U.S. public markets, these situations can still profoundly affect American investors, as evidenced by Canadian teachers being major investors in [[FTX and Regulatory Compliance | FTX]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.

Overall, SOX aimed to prevent future Enron-like collapses by establishing stronger [[security_and_compliance_evolution_in_tech_companies | security and compliance evolution in tech companies]] standards and accountability, particularly for public companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:30">[02:39:30]</a>.

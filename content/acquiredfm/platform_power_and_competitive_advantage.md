This article explores the concept of power within [[platform_business_models | platform business models]], distinguishing it from initial product-market fit and outlining a framework for assessing and developing sustainable competitive advantages. The discussion emphasizes that while platforms create tremendous value, the ability to capture that value for the platform owner, rather than it being arbitraged away by competition, is what defines true power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

## Defining Platforms and Power

A platform is broadly defined as an intermediary for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. This definition extends beyond digital technologies to include historical examples like ancient village matchmakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. The core purpose of a platform is to facilitate exchange between heterogeneous buyers and sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

There are two major step changes in the value of a company: the first is achieving product-market fit, and the second is gaining power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. Power relates to how much of the value created a company gets to keep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. It involves an invention that allows a company to develop a durable competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. Platforms are particularly interesting for studying power because they are complex, idiosyncratic, and often involve different types of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

## The Framework for Analyzing Platform Power

Hamilton Helmer and Chenyi have developed a framework for executives to apply the [[seven_powers_framework | Seven Powers Framework]] to platform businesses, which are more complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This framework revolves around three key questions:

1.  **How is economic value created on your platform, and how does that value change as your platform becomes larger or has more participants attending it?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a> This question focuses on quantifying value creation and its evolution over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>.
2.  **How does each group of your customers perceive their economic value from your platform, and how does that change as your platform gets larger?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a> This addresses the perception of value by different participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.
3.  **What is preventing your competitors from getting to equivalence in that value proposition?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a> This is the core "power" question, focusing on value capture and defending the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>.

### The Role of Technology

Technology is a critical driver for new platforms because it radically lowers transaction costs, enabling the creation of entirely new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:49]</a>. This reduction in friction can manifest in various ways, such as reduced search costs, input costs, or delivery costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.

However, this ease of entry also presents a paradox for power: the very technology that enables rapid scaling and seems powerful can also make it easy for competitors to catch up, as it's easily available to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.

## Case Studies in Platform Power

### Ride-Sharing (Uber/Lyft): Diminishing Returns and Multi-Homing

In ride-sharing, the economic value is created by matching highly heterogeneous drivers and passengers, who are time and location-stamped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>. Greater density allows for more efficient route structures, minimizing driver downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>.

However, the benefit curve for density is not linear; it has diminishing marginal utility and flattens out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. This means that beyond a certain point of density, the marginal improvement in wait times or efficiency becomes negligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.

A major challenge for ride-sharing platforms is "multi-homing," where customers (both riders and drivers) can frictionlessly access competing platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>. If users consistently open two apps to find the best match, then relative scale or density doesn't matter for power, as it gets arbitraged away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>. This makes it difficult for a single ride-sharing company to develop a lasting power advantage based solely on scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>.

### YouTube: Heterogeneity of Preferences and Search Costs

YouTube is an example of a platform with significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>. The content on YouTube is highly heterogeneous, with many dimensions users care about (language, theme, music, production quality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>. This means the curve of diminishing returns to density is much more gradual compared to ride-sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>.

The extreme idiosyncrasy of user tastes means that even with billions of hours of content, there's always potential for a slightly better content-market fit for an individual user on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a>. Furthermore, YouTube accumulates unique knowledge about user preferences and watch time data, which dramatically reduces user search costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>. This makes it challenging for a copycat platform, even with identical content, to match the user experience because it lacks this accumulated data and search efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>.

YouTube's ability to charge mindshare from users, monetize it with advertising dollars, and then pay creators, creates a powerful virtuous cycle that maintains and enlarges its lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a>. Despite creators being able to multi-home their content, viewers' binding to YouTube due to reduced search costs protects its business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>.

### Amazon vs. eBay Sellers: Varying Customer Perception of Value

The second question of the framework, how different customer groups perceive value, is crucial. An Amazon seller, often with a built-out supply chain, seeks to sell more units at a market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:00">[37:05:00]</a>. Their decision to use a platform depends on how many more units they can sell to cover the cost of being on that platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:16:00">[37:16:00]</a>.

Conversely, an eBay seller auctioning an antique watch has only one item to sell and aims for the highest possible price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>. Their calculus involves the likelihood of a buyer with greater willingness to pay appearing on a particular platform, which depends on better matching driven by more participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:44:00">[37:44:00]</a>. Understanding these distinct economic equations for different customer segments is vital for platform operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:12:00">[38:12:00]</a>.

### Apple and TSMC: Strategic Pricing and Value Capture

The decision of when to start capturing value (dialing up profitability, dialing back subsidies) is a tactical, idiosyncratic question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:41:00">[44:41:00]</a>. The concept of "surplus leader margin" helps determine the maximum price a company can charge while maintaining its competitive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:05:00">[46:05:00]</a>.

For Apple, the 30% take rate on its App Store is seen as maximally extractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:34:00">[58:34:00]</a>. However, it seems to make sense because Apple has high switching costs for its users, who are generally satisfied with the product and less aware of the take rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:19:00">[59:19:00]</a>. Developers continue to build for iOS because it offers access to the world's most affluent customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10:00">[01:00:10:00]</a>. Apple's vertical integration and control of the entire stack allows it to fund its significant capital expenditures through hardware sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:44:00">[58:44:00]</a>.

TSMC, in contrast, intentionally does not charge the very most it possibly can for manufacturing chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>. This strategic pricing is a long-term view to ensure customer loyalty and future revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>. In the semiconductor industry, characterized by lumpy, massive capital commitments (e.g., $10+ billion for a new fab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:12:00">[52:12:00]</a>, predictable material performance advances (Moore's Law) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:26:00">[52:26:00]</a>, and reliance on upstream suppliers like ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:56:00">[52:56:00]</a>, customer commitment is paramount. By leaving surplus on the table, TSMC secures forward guarantees from customers like NVIDIA, allowing them to make huge capital investments and lead in advanced technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:36:00">[55:36:00]</a>. This ensures they are at the forefront of the performance frontier, leading to cost and performance advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:39:00">[56:39:00]</a>.

## Network Effects vs. Network Economies

*   **Network effects** describe the value creation aspect: when a new participant joins a network, it makes the platform more valuable to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38:00">[01:06:38:00]</a>. For example, an Uber driver joining makes the platform more valuable to passengers due to more efficient route structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45:00">[01:06:45:00]</a>. Network effects are a statement about value creation without considering competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57:00">[01:08:57:00]</a>.
*   **Network economies** refer to when there is power derived from direct network effects, leading to winner-take-all situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13:00">[01:08:13:00]</a>. This happens when a participant's joining has an immediate, additive value impact on others on the same side of the network (e.g., friends joining Facebook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42:00">[01:07:42:00]</a>. True network economies are rarer because they require both a material benefit *and* a barrier that prevents arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31:00">[01:08:31:00]</a>.

## Flywheels and Power

Flywheels, while indicating strong product-market fit and enabling rapid scaling, tell "absolutely nothing about power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54:00">[01:12:54:00]</a>. A simple thought experiment reveals this: if a company's flywheel diagram still functions when its logo is swapped with a competitor's, it doesn't indicate a unique power advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40:00">[01:13:40:00]</a>. Often, the same technology that allows a flywheel to spin quickly also enables multi-homing and easy competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20:00">[01:13:20:00]</a>. The critical element is the barrier question: why can one company scale faster and maintain that difference once the market is saturated? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48:00">[01:14:48:00]</a>

## Why Power Matters

Founders often focus intensely on achieving product-market fit, which is a massive accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29:00">[01:05:29:00]</a>. However, ignoring the "power" question can lead to a company that is not durable, attractive, or iconic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00:00">[01:05:00:00]</a>. Companies without power can become difficult to manage, with top talent leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37:00">[01:04:37:00]</a>. For founders who seek durability, pride, and an enduring legacy for their company, understanding and developing power is the "second step change" mountain to climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15:00">[01:05:15:00]</a>.

When designing a product that creates value, especially one with high switching costs, it is important to focus first on the value creation for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00:00">[01:02:00:00]</a>. If that proposition naturally leads to customer lock-in, then so be it, but prioritizing "win-lose propositions" by solely focusing on locking in customers tends to lead to poor outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20:00">[01:02:20:00]</a>.

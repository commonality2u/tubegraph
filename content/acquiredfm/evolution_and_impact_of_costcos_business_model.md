Costco, a prominent retailer, has developed a unique and highly successful business model, which Charlie Munger regards as one of the best he has encountered in his lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Early History and Founding Principles

Charlie Munger was introduced to Price Club, Costco's predecessor, by Rod Hills, who knew its founder, Saul Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Saul Price, an intelligent man, was originally a lawyer who, at 39, started a discount company called FedMart (originally Government Employees Discount Company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Munger invested in Price Club by buying stock directly from the market before its merger with Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Jim Sinegal, a co-founder of Costco, later asked Warren Buffett to join Costco's board. Buffett, preferring shorter plane rides to board meetings, suggested Charlie Munger instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

Munger believed Costco exemplified a rare "five or six times in a lifetime" investment opportunity because of its distinct competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>:

*   **Lowest Prices:** Costco consistently sold goods cheaper than anyone else in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** This was achieved through big, efficient stores with ample, wide parking spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Targeted Clientele:** They actively kept out people who did not do big volumes, and in turn, offered special benefits like reward points through executive memberships to high-volume customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Capital-Light Model:** Costco's business model is remarkably capital-light, as they have almost no investment in inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Suppliers are paid only after Costco has sold the merchandise, allowing them to finance their operations with supplier credit rather than their own capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This means their 900 warehouses are full of high-quality merchandise, none of which sits on their books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Price Club, for instance, went public without raising capital because they didn't need it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This strategy is seen as a form of "leverage" not through debt, but through efficient inventory turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   **Low SKU Count:** Costco takes advantage of a low SKU (stock keeping unit) count, a strategy also utilized by grocery chains like Gelson's Brothers in Los Angeles, which also aimed for high turnovers and low capital costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## [[Costcos Competitive Strategies | Strategic Decisions and Culture]]

### Hot Dog Pricing
Costco famously maintained the price of its hot dogs at $1.50 for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. While some might suggest raising the price, Munger noted that this would "destroy everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. The central norm was to "don't raise the market, get it low and keep it there forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. The hot dog, being "half famous," encourages families to bring their kids, contributing to the overall appeal and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>. The decision to keep the hot dog price fixed was not a board-level discussion, but rather an understood principle among leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

### Growth and Execution
Costco's growth is intentionally managed, typically around 10% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. This deliberate pace is due to the inherent difficulties in opening new stores, which involve new managers, local politics, and extensive learning and teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>. They prioritize comfortable handling over rapid expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>. The success of Costco is attributed to a combination of its business model, culture, and "very reliable, hard-working, determined execution for 40 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>.

### Customer Demographics
Despite its low prices, Costco's audience tends to skew wealthy. This was a deliberate strategy by Saul Price from the Price Club days, aiming to attract "the rich man trying to save money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. These customers are often smart and picky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.

## [[Costcos Global Expansion | Global Expansion]]

Costco's initial attempt to expand into China was met with a demand for a $30,000 bribe, which deeply offended Jim Sinegal. This incident deterred him from pursuing Chinese expansion for approximately 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. Only later, due to agitation from the board, did Costco finally re-enter the Chinese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

## [[Costcos Competitive Strategies | Impact and Influence on Competitors]]

### Walmart
Walmart, despite its initial dominance in small towns with cheap real estate, struggled to compete with Costco in the rich suburbs. Walmart's leadership was "too wedded" to their existing ideas and found it offensive to pay up for good locations, which Costco specialized in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. This inability to [[Importance of adapting business models | adapt its business model]] and strategy was considered a "terrible mistake" for Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. Charlie Munger did not know [[Sam Waltons business strategies and philosophy | Sam Walton]], but he knew one of his sons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

### Home Depot
Home Depot, founded by Bernie Marcus, directly copied Costco's model, applying it to home improvements. Marcus visited Saul Price, who was "happy to share the playbook" with everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. This adaptation of Costco's low SKU, efficient store model led to significant success for Home Depot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

### Floor and Decor
Floor & Decor is another contemporary imitator of the Costco model, specializing in flooring, particularly vinyl wood flooring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Munger notes that adding "miscellaneous stuff" (like other items beyond flooring) could eventually dilute their focus and "kill" the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

## [[Costcos Business Model and Success | Kirkland Signature]] as a Brand

Kirkland Signature, Costco's private label brand, is considered a "brand the way Tide is a brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>, implying a focus on value and reliability rather than luxury or fashion.

## Broader Retail Context

Warren Buffett generally dislikes retail investments due to the high competition and constant threats that have led to the demise of many once-mighty retailers, such as Sears Roebuck and big department stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. He considered it "too damn difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Despite this, Berkshire Hathaway's "Diversified Retail" venture made significant money, not primarily from the retail operations themselves, but from leveraging available cash to buy their own undervalued stock during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This strategy led to substantial profits and contributed to the early success of Blue Chip Stamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

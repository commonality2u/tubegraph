## General Magic and its Influence on Silicon Valley

General Magic is regarded as the "epicenter of pretty much all innovation that has ever come out of [[silicon_valleys_evolution_and_expansion|Silicon Valley]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The company played a significant role in pioneering concepts that would later become foundational to modern technology, particularly the internet and mobile computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Pioneering Innovations

General Magic is credited with inventing the concept of "cloud" and the concept of "Mobile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. These foundational ideas would shape the future of digital interaction and connectivity.

### Pierre Omidyar's Connection

Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, worked as an engineer at General Magic after his time at Ink, a pen computing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. His background in pen computing made his move to General Magic, which focused on mobile concepts, a logical progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Omidyar was a full-time employee at General Magic when he began tinkering with what would become eBay (originally called AuctionWeb) in his free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

His experience at both Ink and General Magic provided him with an understanding of how venture capitalists (VCS) and a professional board could benefit a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

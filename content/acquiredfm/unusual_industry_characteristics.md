The [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor industry]] exhibits particularly "strange industry characteristics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, which lead to a unique type of scale economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Companies like [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | TSMC]] may prioritize future revenues, customer retention, or new customer acquisition over current profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Defining Characteristics

Several factors contribute to the unusual nature of this industry:

### Large, Lumpy Capital Investment

Establishing new manufacturing facilities, known as "fabs," requires immense capital. A new fab today can cost $10 billion or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Predictable Technological Advancement

Unlike most industries, the [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor industry]] benefits from "predictable material performance advances," most notably [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This means companies can have a high degree of assurance that making the correct [[technological_innovation_in_traditional_industries | technology choices]] will lead to a 10x improvement in approximately 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This level of predictability is not typical in other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Dependence on Upstream Suppliers

Technological advantages in the industry are significantly "driven by upstream suppliers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Companies like ASML play a crucial role in providing the advanced equipment necessary for production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Decisions regarding which supplier technologies to adopt can be challenging, as seen historically with debates in [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor companies]] about technologies like x-ray lithography, which involved significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

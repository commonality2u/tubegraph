The fundamental purpose of copyright law is to stimulate innovation and creativity [00:00:20], [00:00:31]. When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence, governing the economic split between artists, [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|record labels]], and [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|music publishers]] [00:00:41].

## Two Types of Music Copyrights

### 1. Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording)
The first copyright is the sound recording copyright, also known as a master recording or "master" [00:00:50], [00:00:52]. This copyright pertains to the literal recording of the music as it was captured in the studio and heard by the audience [00:01:00], [00:01:07].

Historically, the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|record label]] typically owns these masters or recording copyrights [00:00:58], [00:01:09]. This ownership structure emerged because [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|labels]] traditionally assumed the significant financial risk associated with funding, distributing, and promoting an artist's work [00:01:14], [00:07:10]. This model has been compared to the early days of the venture capital industry, where investors would take a majority stake in a company in exchange for providing capital [00:01:21], [00:01:31]. Despite significant changes in market terms for venture capital, the music industry has seen less evolution due to the limited number of dominant [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|labels]] (essentially three) [00:01:48], [00:01:57].

Under this arrangement, artists typically receive a royalty stream of about 10-15% of the economics generated from their master recordings, though very popular artists might negotiate up to 20-22% [00:05:46], [00:05:49]. The vast majority of these earnings go to the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|record label]] [00:05:51], [00:05:54].

### 2. Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)
The second copyright is the musical composition copyright, or publishing right [00:02:05], [00:02:08]. This covers the underlying written lyrics and melodyâ€”the "idea" of the song that could be put down on sheet music, before it's actually played and recorded [00:02:10], [00:02:20], [00:02:26].

Traditionally, these rights are held by the songwriters themselves, often managed through [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|music publishers]] [00:02:13], [00:02:15], [00:02:37]. Historically, [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|publishers]] would take 50% of the royalties generated from the composition copyright [00:02:50], [00:05:19]. However, this has changed over time, with [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|publishers]] now taking a much smaller share, sometimes just a fixed fee from bigger songwriters for administrative services [00:02:54], [00:02:56], [00:03:00]. Consequently, songwriters largely retain ownership and decision-making power over their musical composition copyrights [00:03:05], [00:03:08], [00:03:14].

Historically, [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|music publishers]] held immense power, especially in the era before widespread recorded music, when sheet music was the primary medium for consuming songs [00:03:21], [00:03:27], [00:03:32]. At that time, artists and [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|record labels]] were reliant on [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|publishers]] who owned the sheet music rights [00:03:41], [00:03:46], [00:03:48].

Even in modern times, co-writing credits and the splits of songwriting economics are privately negotiated between songwriters, ranging from 50/50 to 90/10, or even a flat fee or small royalty for guest contributions [00:04:33], [00:04:35], [00:04:38], [00:04:53], [00:04:55], [00:04:57], [00:05:00], [00:05:10].

### Copyright Control and Licensing
Different uses of music require approval from either the sound recording copyright owner, the musical composition copyright owner, or both [00:03:57], [00:04:00], [00:04:03]. Both parties essentially hold a veto right over how the final product can be used [00:04:05], [00:04:10], [00:04:12]. The income splits derived from these licenses vary wildly depending on the specific use case of the music [00:04:20], [00:04:23].

## Advances and Recoupment

A key aspect of the [[advances_and_recoupment_in_music_contracts|economic split]] between artists and [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|labels]] is the concept of recoupment [00:05:58], [00:06:00]. When a [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|record label]] signs a distribution deal and fronts an artist money to make an album, the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|label]] owns the master recording [00:05:37], [00:05:40]. The artist only begins to receive their negotiated royalty percentage (e.g., 10-15%) *after* the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers|label]] has recouped the initial advance provided to the artist [00:06:03], [00:06:08], [00:06:13], [00:06:25], [00:06:27], [00:06:32]. This model is analogous to a VC preference stack on a cap table, where the investor gets paid back first [00:06:36], [00:06:40].

This system is a relic from an earlier era where it was extremely costly to produce an album, distribute it, and market it to fans through radio and other channels [00:06:46], [00:06:50], [00:06:53], [00:06:55]. Furthermore, most artists fail to achieve widespread success [00:07:08], [00:07:19]. The economic split was designed so that the profits from successful artists could offset the significant losses from those who didn't succeed, similar to how a venture capital fund's winners cover the losses of its losers [00:07:11], [00:07:27], [00:07:32], [00:07:37]. However, with changes in the music industry, particularly regarding how audiences are built, this traditional model is now largely perceived as outdated and potentially predatory [00:07:01], [00:07:05], [00:07:39], [00:07:41].

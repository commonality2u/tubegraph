Investing in public and private markets requires distinct approaches, skill sets, and risk appetites. While public markets are characterized by abundant information, private markets, particularly venture capital, offer opportunities for advantage due to their relative illiquidity and the need for long-term qualitative judgments about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Public Markets

In [[public_vs_private_equity_and_venture_capital_strategies | public markets]], there is an abundance of information, making it challenging for investors to gain a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Quantitative information about the present is readily available, meaning it alone cannot provide a unique edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Therefore, investors must either excel at massaging current data, making qualitative judgments, or forecasting future trends to achieve a knowledge advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Private Market Investing: Venture Capital

Venture capital, a form of [[public_vs_private_equity_and_venture_capital_strategies | private market investing]], is not necessarily inefficient, but it is a market where access to opportunities is difficult, and competition for investing in promising companies is fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Reasons for Entering Venture Capital

An investor's decision to shift towards early-stage [[venture_capital_and_crossover_investing | private market investing]] can be driven by a passion for working with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, but also by strategic considerations:

*   **Skill Set Suitability** It suits a skill set that involves making long-term qualitative judgments about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This contrasts with the analysis typically required for public markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Identifying Value Gaps** Venture investing involves identifying significant discrepancies between the current investment cost and a company's potential future worth if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This requires imagining what a business could look like in 10 years if it succeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Probabilistic Endeavor** It is a highly probabilistic endeavor focused on finding investments with extremely high expected value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. While the average outcome might be a loss of capital, making enough of these bets is expected to yield a great return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Investors also aim to support these companies and allocate more capital to those performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Risk and Returns in Venture Capital

Venture capital contrasts sharply with traditional views of risk, which often define risk as permanent capital loss and advise avoiding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. In venture, it is common to lose money on individual investments, but the overall portfolio strategy aims for high returns from a few successful ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. An investor's comfort with being an optimist and thinking about what a company *could* be if it works is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Applying Traditional Lenses to Venture

Applying traditional [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investing lenses]], such as those derived from [[value_investing_vs_growth_investing | value investing]] principles (e.g., Buffett's approach), to venture capital can be valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This involves:
*   Assessing the potential worth of a business if it succeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Estimating the probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   Visualizing future business models, financials, and competitive advantages (moats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   Considering required capital, likelihood of competition, and potential evolution of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Investor Aptitude and Gravitation

The optimal [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investment approach]] depends significantly on an individual's skills, personality, and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. For example:
*   Some excel at [[value_investing_vs_growth_investing | value investing]], focusing on undervalued assets or companies perceived to be worse off than they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Others, like venture capitalists, thrive on optimism and a focus on future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   For individuals with strong quantitative skills and a conservative personality, areas like bond investing or distressed debt may be more suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Distressed Debt Investing
> In [[public_vs_private_equity_and_venture_capital_strategies | distressed debt investing]], the strategy involves buying the debt of bankrupt companies. While these companies may not repay in full, they might repay a portion, or creditors might acquire the company, which could hold value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This approach appeals to a different set of skills and risk preferences than venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Ultimately, choosing an [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investment approach]] that aligns with one's natural strengths and preferences is more effective than attempting to fit into an unsuitable role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This self-awareness contributes to successful long-term investment outcomes in the ever-evolving market landscape, part of [[the_impact_of_market_evolution_on_investing | the impact of market evolution on investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

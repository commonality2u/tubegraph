Security and compliance are increasingly critical considerations for startups, especially those in the B2B space. Traditionally viewed as administrative burdens, they are now becoming strategic assets. Christina Cacioppo, founder and CEO of Vanta, provides insights into this evolving landscape.

## The New Role of Security and Compliance

Initially perceived as mere box-checking exercises, security and compliance have evolved significantly. Startups can no longer afford to view these functions purely from a defensive standpoint. Instead, they must leverage them as offensive capabilities to gain strategic advantages. Compliance can facilitate market entry, especially in highly regulated industries or international markets, and enhance overall business credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## The Growing Importance in B2B Companies

Proving strong security measures to buyers has become essential when raising capital or entering new markets. [[security_and_compliance_with_vanta | Vanta]]'s experiences highlight this shift. When Vanta was raising seed capital in 2018, many venture capitalists questioned the need for SOC 2 compliance among startups. However, by 2022, most [[y_combinators_continuity_fund_and_its_growth_investments | Y Combinator]] startups and B2B companies are pursuing SOC 2 as a critical component of their business strategy. This trend is fueled by the increasing demand for startups to move up-market more rapidly, targeting enterprise-level clients and industries with strict regulatory requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## The Strategic Advantage of Compliance

Startups that prioritize rigorous security and compliance demonstrate to potential clients and investors that they are reliable and trustworthy partners. These credentials can be critical differentiators, particularly in competitive markets where traditional brand reputation alone is insufficient. Vanta positions compliance not just as a necessary expense but as an investment that unlocks new markets and revenue streams. In an environment where enterprise clients are concerned about vendor security, establishing robust compliance standards can foster trust and long-term business relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

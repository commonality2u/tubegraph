Pierre Omidyar's path to founding eBay began in the mid-1990s, evolving from his background in pen computing and e-commerce software. His journey illustrates the experimental nature of early internet entrepreneurship and the serendipitous discovery of product-market fit.

## Early Ventures: Ink and Pen Computing
Prior to eBay, [[Pierre Omidyars growth and initial business model | Pierre Omidyar]] worked as an engineer at a pen computing company called Ink [00:00:13]. Bruce Dunleavy from Merrell Pickard Anderson and Air was an investor in Ink [00:00:21]. The pen computing space largely did not "pan out" for most companies, with Palm Pilot being a notable exception [00:00:31]. Despite this, Ink's VCs and management team pivoted the company into early e-commerce software enablement and enterprise software [00:00:45]. This pivot led to the company's acquisition by [[founding_of_microsoft_and_its_early_years | Microsoft]], which was considered a "good outcome" for all involved [00:00:59]. Omidyar had fond memories of his time at Ink and built a relationship with Bruce Dunleavy during this period [00:01:09].

## Transition to General Magic
After Ink, and before starting eBay (then known as Auction Web), Omidyar joined General Magic [00:01:14]. General Magic is described as the "epicenter of pretty much all innovation that has ever come out of Silicon Valley" [00:01:27]. The company was groundbreaking, inventing concepts like "cloud" and "mobile" [00:01:50]. Given his background in pen computing, Omidyar's move to General Magic "makes sense" [00:01:57]. He was a full-time employee at General Magic when he started working on what would become eBay [00:03:06].

## Founding and Early Growth of eBay (Auction Web)
While working at General Magic, Omidyar famously began "tinkering around on the early internet" in his free time [00:02:04]. He started a collection of internet services he called eBay, short for "electronic Bay Area" [00:02:10]. The initial website was basic, described as a "courier font website" with various content and programmatic elements under the eBay umbrella [00:02:26]. One of the main features on the site, among about five, was "Auction Web," which eventually became the core of eBay [00:02:43].

At this stage, Omidyar was an engineer with a side project, and his status was not initially considered "CEO material" by venture capitalists, unlike [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Jeff Bezos]] who came from D.E. Shaw with a full business plan [00:03:00].

### The Accidental Business Model
Initially, [[ebays_growth_and_initial_business_model | Pierre Omidyar]] hosted auctions for free, with "no business model" [00:03:41]. However, traffic grew so rapidly that his server costs "went through the roof" [00:03:45]. Reluctantly, he began asking users to pay a small listing fee to cover expenses [00:03:48]. Famously, users would send checks to his apartment, which he received in such volume that he "can't open the mail fast enough" [00:03:59]. This influx of payments demonstrated "product market fit" [00:04:06].

To manage the overwhelming number of checks, Omidyar brought on Jeff Skoll, a newly minted MBA from Stanford Business School, to be the "business guy," whose initial literal task was to "open the checks and cash them" [00:04:10]. It is noted that if not for the server costs, eBay might have remained a free, non-profit resource akin to the Linux Foundation or Wikipedia [00:04:29]. Instead, it became a leading internet company [00:04:43]. By this point, eBay was growing 10% month-over-month and was profitable, generating significant cash flow [00:07:11].

## Investment and Acquisition Considerations
After bringing on Jeff Skoll and witnessing the business's success, Omidyar became open to building eBay as a formal business [00:05:04]. Drawing from his experiences at Ink and General Magic, he recognized the value of VCs and a professional board [00:05:14].

Omidyar and Skoll pitched to numerous venture capital firms on Sand Hill Road, but "literally everybody else turns them down" [00:05:27]. [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_in_ebay | Benchmark Capital]], however, showed interest, particularly through Bruce Dunleavy and his partners Bob Kagle and David Beirne [00:05:37].

### Competing Offers and the Secondary
[[the_decision_between_selling_ebay_or_growing_it_independently | Benchmark]] offered Pierre and Jeff a term sheet for a $6.7 million Series A financing at a $20 million pre-money valuation [00:06:10]. At the same time, they had a competing acquisition offer from Knight Ridder, a large newspaper conglomerate [00:06:20]. Knight Ridder's offer was compelling: $50 million [00:07:33]. This was a significant sum, especially for what was then essentially a "two-person company that like was barely a company" [00:07:52].

There is debate among those involved regarding the specifics of Benchmark's investment and whether a secondary transaction occurred [00:07:57].
*   One version suggests that none of the $6.7 million invested by Benchmark was actually used by the company because eBay was already profitable and remained so [00:08:18].
*   It was reported that Benchmark acquired 22.1% of eBay at IPO [00:08:57].
*   The Washington Post reported that Benchmark also structured equity-backed loans of $750,000 each to Omidyar and Skoll [00:09:00]. This $1.5 million was intended to provide an incentive for them not to take Knight Ridder's acquisition offer, effectively acting as a secondary [00:09:16].
*   Another Benchmark partner at the time reportedly stated that $3 million (50%) of the investment round was used as a secondary [00:09:47].
*   Conversely, some reports claim no secondary transaction occurred [00:09:57].

Despite the debate, evidence from SEC filings suggests some form of equity-backed loans or secondary transaction did occur [00:10:05]. This was an "untraditional, highly non-consensus" approach at the time, as Benchmark was "the only VC terms even the only ones willing to structure a deal like this" [00:10:32]. The rationale was to allow entrepreneurs to "take some money off the table" to prevent them from selling the company prematurely [00:10:47].

## Post-Investment Success
The deal with [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_in_ebay | Benchmark]] closed in the summer of 1997 [00:11:29]. Just over a year later, in September 1998, eBay went public [00:11:37]. During this period, with Benchmark and David Beirne heavily involved, eBay recruited [[meg_whitmans_leadership_and_ebays_ipo_success | Meg Whitman]] from Hasbro (and formerly Disney Strat planning and Bain Consulting) to take over as CEO [00:11:43].

At the IPO, Benchmark's $6.7 million investment was worth $400 million [00:12:11]. By the time their lockup expired approximately six months later in Spring 1999, that stake had soared to over $4 billion [00:12:25]. This represented an approximately 600x return on investment in less than two years [00:12:38]. The $4 billion return alone was 47x Benchmark's $85 million fund [00:12:34]. If the reported equity-backed loans were indeed incremental, it could have added an additional $1 billion to the return [00:13:03]. Benchmark distributed $4 billion to its limited partners [00:13:37]. This massive success generated approximately $1.5 billion in carry dollars for the equal partnership, with even assistants receiving pieces of carry, leading to stories of "Benchmark assistants becoming multi-millionaires" [00:14:47].

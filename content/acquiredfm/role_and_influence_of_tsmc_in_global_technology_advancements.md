[[TSMC]] (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) has grown to become a cornerstone of the global technology industry, influencing nearly every aspect of modern computing through its specialized [[semiconductors | semiconductor]] manufacturing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The company's unique "pure-play foundry" model and strategic decisions have propelled it to the forefront, enabling the growth of the "fabless" industry and driving continuous innovation in [[technological_advancements_and_supplier_impacts_in_semiconductors | chip technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>.

## Founding Vision and the Pure-Play Model

[[Morris Chang and the founding of TSMC | Morris Chang]], the 93-year-old founder of [[TSMC]], established the company with a revolutionary vision in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:35">[01:56:35]</a>. His core idea was to create a "dedicated Pure Play Foundry" that would not compete with its own customers by designing chips itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:26">[02:22:26]</a>. This model allowed fabless companies – those that design chips but do not manufacture them – to thrive, fostering a new ecosystem in the [[semiconductors | semiconductor]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>.

Initially, [[TSMC]]'s business primarily involved manufacturing less critical chips for integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel, essentially serving as a "second source" supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>. However, [[Morris Chang]] foresaw the rise of the fabless model, observing early companies like Cirrus Logic (initially called ATM) that designed chips without owning fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:50">[02:19:50]</a>. This foresight positioned [[TSMC]] perfectly to capitalize on the shift towards specialized design and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>.

## Key Partnerships and Industry Transformation

[[TSMC]]'s influence is deeply intertwined with its crucial partnerships, particularly with leading fabless companies:

*   **Nvidia**: The relationship began in 1997 when a small, struggling Nvidia, led by Jensen Huang, sought a foundry for their promising chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Despite Nvidia having only 50-60 employees and facing bankruptcy, [[Morris Chang]] personally intervened to secure the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The success of Nvidia's game chip not only saved the company but also quickly made it a major [[TSMC]] customer within two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Even when [[TSMC]] faced yield and quality problems with its 40nm node in 2009, [[Morris Chang]] returned as CEO to personally resolve the dispute with Nvidia, offering a compensation of over $100 million, which reinforced the strong, long-term partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:06">[03:31:06]</a>.

*   **Apple**: Securing Apple as a customer was a significant strategic goal for [[TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>. In 2010, an unexpected visit from Terry Gou (Foxconn's founder and a relative of [[Morris Chang]]'s wife) and Jeff Williams (Apple's COO) initiated discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. Apple initially desired manufacturing on the 20nm node, a "half step" that was a detour from [[TSMC]]'s planned progression to 16nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. Despite the significant capital investment required for this unplanned node, and Apple's initial consideration of Intel, [[TSMC]] accepted half of Apple's demand, funding it through corporate bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:23">[01:25:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>. Tim Cook's explanation that "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" underscored [[TSMC]]'s superior customer trust and service, contrasting with Intel's perceived arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>. This partnership eventually led to [[TSMC]] producing all of Apple's chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. The decision to pursue 20nm, however, delayed [[TSMC]]'s 16nm development, allowing Samsung to initially take Apple's first 16nm orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:11">[01:53:11]</a>. Nevertheless, [[TSMC]] quickly caught up, regaining most of Apple's 16nm business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>.

*   **Qualcomm**: [[TSMC]] actively pursued Qualcomm as a customer from its early days in the 1990s due to Qualcomm's reputation as a technology house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:49">[01:56:49]</a>. Qualcomm, initially reliant on IBM as its main foundry, eventually shifted its business to [[TSMC]] in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This shift signaled IBM's decline in the foundry business and led to [[TSMC]]'s refusal to co-develop the 0.13 micron node with IBM, prioritizing its independent development and customer trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

## Technological Leadership and Investment Strategy

[[TSMC]]'s unparalleled technological leadership is a result of a consistent, aggressive investment strategy:

*   **R&D Commitment**: After retaking the CEO role in 2009, [[Morris Chang]] instituted an 8% of revenue commitment to R&D, regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. This steady and substantial investment empowered [[TSMC]]'s R&D teams to innovate without annual budget negotiations, identifying "sweet spots" like the 28nm node that would become critical for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.

*   **Capital Expenditures**: [[TSMC]] dramatically increased its capital expenditures, from approximately $2-2.5 billion per year to nearly $6 billion in 2010, primarily to scale up for the 28nm node and later the 20nm node for Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This aggressive investment, which faced questions from the board, was driven by market forecasts and the belief that these nodes would be crucial for future growth, particularly coinciding with the smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

*   **Moore's Law and Node Progression**: [[TSMC]]'s commitment to advancing process nodes, such as 28nm, 20nm, 16nm, and down to 2nm, reflects its dedication to Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:06">[03:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>. The company aims to be the largest volume player in each new node, leveraging the "learning curve" to drive down costs and capture market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:39">[02:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. This strategy creates a flywheel effect: higher volume leads to lower prices, which attracts more business, enabling reinvestment in the next generation of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>.

## The [[TSMCs strategic decisions and partnerships | TSMC]] Ecosystem in Taiwan

The concentration of [[TSMC]]'s operations in Taiwan, particularly in the Hsinchu Science Park, is a critical factor in its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:42">[02:27:42]</a>. This park hosts not only [[TSMC]]'s fabs but also its partners and customers, including EDA (Electronic Design Automation) companies like Synopsys and Cadence, architecture firms like ARM, and other fabless companies like MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">[02:30:28]</a>. The presence of two universities within the park, continuously producing PhDs, further strengthens this specialized ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>.

This tightly integrated environment facilitates close communication and collaboration necessary for developing cutting-edge process nodes. Replicating this "magic" outside of Taiwan, as seen with initiatives like the Arizona Fab, is incredibly challenging and would take decades due to the deep interdependencies and specialized talent pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53">[02:30:53]</a>. The Hsinchu Science Park stands as a prime example of a highly successful government-funded industrial initiative to spur [[semiconductors | semiconductor]] innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:11">[02:31:11]</a>.

## Business Philosophy and Influence

[[Morris Chang]]'s leadership instilled a unique business philosophy that contributed significantly to [[TSMC]]'s long-term influence:

*   **Customer-Centricity and Trust**: Unlike Intel, which was often disliked by its customers due to perceived arrogance, [[TSMC]] prioritized customer trust and courteous responses to requests, even the irrational ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:14">[01:46:14]</a>. This approach, combined with the pure-play model, ensured customers didn't feel [[TSMC]] was competing with them, fostering loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:01">[02:24:01]</a>. [[TSMC]] also learned to require deposits for wafer orders to ensure customer commitment, a practice that, while initially shocking to salesmen, never resulted in actual confiscation but ensured serious intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:12">[02:26:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:35">[02:27:35]</a>.

*   **Long-Term Vision**: [[Morris Chang]] emphasized long-term stability and growth over short-term financial gains. His refusal to implement layoffs during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, a departure from the previous CEO's actions, highlighted a commitment to employee retention and a belief in the cyclical nature of the [[semiconductors | semiconductor]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>. He also maintained dividends and avoided selling new stock even when facing massive capital needs, demonstrating a focus on shareholder stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>.

[[TSMC]]'s role and influence are undeniable. By mastering the intricate process of [[semiconductors | semiconductor]] manufacturing and fostering a unique business model, [[TSMC]] has become indispensable to the global technology landscape, enabling countless innovations from smartphones to AI, and continually pushing the boundaries of Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a>.

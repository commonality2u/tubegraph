[[lockheed_martin_history | Lockheed Martin]], the nation's largest defense contractor and the federal government's largest contractor overall, has a fascinating history rooted in hardcore engineering and daring innovation, playing a critical role in [[technological advancements in aerospace | technological advancements in aerospace]] [00:01:19]. The company, which pays around $50 billion annually from American taxpayers, is synonymous with "overwhelming foreign and air superiority" [00:01:30]. While its products are often used as deterrents, they are fundamentally "killing machines" [00:01:39].

The full history of [[lockheed_martin_history | Lockheed Martin]] and its 17 predecessor companies would require extensive study [00:02:40]. However, key periods highlight its contributions to [[technological advancements in aerospace | technological advancements in aerospace]]:

## Early Innovations and Foundations
The first Lockheed company was founded in 1912 by Allan Loughead (later Lockheed), originally operating in San Francisco as a tourist attraction with its Model G plane, aiming to evangelize new flying [[technology_infrastructure_evolution | technology]] [00:04:48]. Allan's brother, Malcolm Lockheed, separately invented the modern hydraulic brake system for automobiles, a [[technological innovations in payment processing | technology]] still in use today [00:05:49].

John Northrop, a key figure in aerospace, was hired by the first Lockheed company to help design future airplanes [00:06:02]. He later co-founded the second Lockheed company with Allan, before leaving to found Avion Corporation (which became part of Boeing) and then Northrop (now Northrop Grumman) [00:06:12]. Northrop played a major role in founding or developing three of the five remaining defense prime contractors [00:06:30].

The second Lockheed company found success with the Vega airplane, a favorite of early aviators like Amelia Earhart [0006:42]. In 1932, Robert Gross acquired the Lockheed division out of bankruptcy for $40,000, effectively founding the modern Lockheed [00:08:00]. Under Gross, Lockheed built the famous Electra airplane in the 1930s, an iconic early aircraft [00:08:49].

## World War II and the Birth of Skunk Works
World War II profoundly transformed Lockheed [00:09:31]. Clarence "Kelly" Johnson, a brilliant engineer, adapted the Electra into the Hudson bombing vehicle [00:13:50]. Before the U.S. entered the war, the British Royal Air Force purchased approximately 3,000 Hudsons from Lockheed [00:13:52]. Johnson then designed the P-38 Lightning fighter, the U.S.'s elite, fastest, and most maneuverable aircraft during World War II, with over 10,000 produced [00:14:18].

Towards the end of WWII, the emergence of German jet-powered fighter planes, like the Messerschmitt Me 262 "Swallow" (flying at 550 mph, 100 mph faster than Allied planes), signaled a new era of air warfare [00:15:58]. Jet [[technology_infrastructure_evolution | technology]] was a radical departure from propeller-driven aircraft, transforming engine thrust from internal combustion to air compression [00:16:37].

In response, the U.S. government tasked Kelly Johnson and Lockheed with developing a jet fighter prototype within 180 days, capable of exceeding 600 mph [00:18:11]. This led to the creation of the famous "Skunk Works" division [00:19:18]. Kelly hand-picked 23 engineers and 30 shop personnel, housing them in a rented circus tent near a plastics factory in Burbank, California, which gave the division its distinctive name due to the smell [00:19:06].

Within 143 days, this elite team built the first prototype U.S. fighter jet, the "Lulu Bell," which became the P-80 Shooting Star [00:20:05]. The P-80, powered by a British Halford H1B Goblin engine (as Lockheed did not manufacture engines) [02:11:00], became the first jet fighter plane in the U.S. military and was used in the Korean War [00:21:07]. This rapid development process was a testament to Kelly Johnson's 14 rules for Skunk Works, which emphasized restricted personnel, complete program control, and performance-based rewards [00:25:34].

## The Cold War and Strategic Reconnaissance

### U2 Spy Plane
The Cold War brought a new existential threat: the Soviet Union's acquisition of nuclear bombs in 1949 [00:34:33]. Intelligence became paramount for deterrence [00:36:27]. This led to the development of the U2 spy plane by Skunk Works for the CIA, a critical piece of American infrastructure designed for high-altitude reconnaissance [00:37:07].

The U2 was engineered to fly at 70,000 feet, well above the 40,000-45,000 feet maximum altitude of existing aircraft and the estimated 55,000 feet radar detection limit of the Soviets [00:39:32]. Achieving this required new [[technological innovations in payment processing | technological innovations]]:
*   **Fuel:** Shell Oil developed a new jet fuel formulation that worked at extreme altitudes [00:40:27].
*   **Pilot Protection:** Pilots needed specialized spacesuits to survive the low pressure and temperature, technology derived from diving suits [00:40:51].
*   **Camera System:** Dr. Edwin Land and the Polaroid company designed an entirely new camera and lens capable of taking high-resolution photographs from 70,000 feet [00:42:56].

The U2 prototype was delivered in 1.5 years for $3.5 million [00:41:47]. Its testing took place at a dry lake bed in Nevada called Groom Lake, a site previously used for nuclear bomb testing, which became famously known as Area 51 [00:44:09]. The mysterious flights and a spacesuit-clad pilot after a crash contributed to UFO rumors, which inadvertently served as a cover for the secret operations [00:46:53].

The first U2 overflight of the Soviet Union occurred on July 4, 1956 [00:48:52]. Though the Soviets tracked the plane on radar, they could not shoot it down, confirming its high-altitude evasion capability [00:49:11]. This led to years of U2 missions, providing crucial intelligence on Soviet nuclear and military capabilities [00:50:26]. However, on May 1, 1960, a U2 piloted by Francis Gary Powers was shot down by a new Soviet missile capable of reaching 70,000 feet, ending U2 overflights of Russia [00:53:07].

### Emergence of Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LMSC)
In parallel with Skunk Works' efforts, a new secret division of Lockheed, the Lockheed Missile Systems Division (later LMSC), was established in 1954 [01:08:42]. This division would become the single largest employer in proto-Silicon Valley, significantly impacting the [[technology_infrastructure_evolution | technology]] and business landscape [01:08:26].

LMSC's focus on missile guidance systems, requiring advanced radar and computing, led it to relocate to the Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park) in 1955 [01:10:40]. This move was driven by Stanford Professor Frederick Terman, a leading expert in radio engineering and early computing, who recruited top talent to Stanford and fostered a unique commercial ecosystem to serve national defense needs [01:02:47].

LMSC became a massive employer in Sunnyvale, California, growing to 20,000 employees by 1959 and 30,000 by the mid-1960s, making it by far the largest employer in Silicon Valley, dwarfing companies like Hewlett-Packard [01:12:35]. The presence of LMSC in Silicon Valley drew top engineering talent, including Jerry Wozniak, father of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, directly influencing the region's development [01:15:53].

LMSC took on two historic projects:

*   **Polaris Missile Program:** In 1955, the Navy contracted Lockheed to develop the Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) system [01:19:56]. The challenge was to fire intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from submarines [01:21:21]. By 1960, the first U.S. nuclear ballistic missile-equipped submarine, armed with Lockheed's Polaris A1 undersea-fired nuclear warheads, was operational, capable of hitting land targets up to 1,200 nautical miles away [01:23:17]. This completely changed the strategic landscape of deterrence, making a first strike against the U.S. impossible due to the guaranteed second-strike capability [01:21:29]. The Polaris program evolved into the Poseidon and Trident missiles, with the latter having a 5,000-mile range [01:26:04].
*   **Corona Spy Satellite Program:** Following the U2 incident, LMSC filled the intelligence gap with a secret U.S. Space Program [01:29:01]. The first program, Corona, involved observational spy satellites with cameras [01:31:52]. The first Corona satellite launched in August 1960, and its first mission produced more photo coverage of the Soviet Union than all previous U2 flights combined [01:34:27]. These satellites, which were film systems, captured images with a resolution as low as five feet from space [01:33:40]. The film canisters were literally dropped from orbit, re-entering the atmosphere, deploying parachutes, and being caught mid-air by C-130 aircraft using a "claw" [01:36:16]. This program took over 800,000 images and was kept secret for 35 years until its declassification in 1995 [01:35:00]. Corona led to follow-up programs like Gambit (better resolution, less than two feet from space by 1963) [01:41:09], Hexagon (wider coverage) [01:41:45], and Kennen (first real-time space-based surveillance system by 1977, using digital photography beamed via ground link) [01:42:24]. LMSC also contributed to weather satellites and the GPS system [01:44:50].

LMSC became the most profitable division within Lockheed, generating over 100% of the company's profits in some years during the 1970s when other divisions were in the red [01:50:07]. This profitability was attributed to the nature of [[technology_infrastructure_evolution | technology]] problems (computing, silicon, software) that offered better margins than building airplanes [01:50:40].

### SR-71 Blackbird and Stealth Technology
Skunk Works, under Ben Rich (Kelly Johnson's successor), developed the SR-71 Blackbird, a successor to the U2 [02:06:08]. The Blackbird was designed to be so fast that it could outrun any missile [01:56:05]. Its target was Mach 3 or faster, exceeding 2,000 miles per hour [01:57:11]. The Blackbird had an incredible turning radius, wider than the state of Ohio, and flew at 84,000 feet, where the sky appears black [01:57:51]. It required pilots to wear spacesuits and used a new navigational system that relied on stars due to the speed at which ground landmarks moved past [01:58:31].

The SR-71 was built primarily from titanium, a metal not previously used for entire aircraft due to its hardness [02:01:33]. Lockheed sourced titanium from the Soviet Union through dummy corporations to build the planes [02:02:01]. The plane's panels had to be designed to fit loosely on the ground to allow for expansion at high speeds, causing fuel to leak while stationary [02:03:06]. A custom, non-flammable fuel was developed by Shell to address this [02:03:55].

The Blackbird's engines, a modified version of the Pratt & Whitney J58, could only produce 25% of the necessary thrust [02:05:05]. Ben Rich's team engineered the "spike inlet system" — large cones in front of the engines that acted as superchargers, compressing and superheating massive amounts of air to provide 75% of the thrust needed for sustained Mach 3+ flight [02:05:23].

The A12 (CIA version) and SR-71 (Air Force version) were reconnaissance aircraft, never carrying weapons [02:06:36]. The SR-71 holds records for speed and altitude for an air-breathing manned aircraft [02:00:32]. It was also the first stealth airplane, largely due to its unique, faceted flat-bottomed shape that bounced radar waves away from the receiver [02:12:24]. Its radar signature was less than an eighth of an inch sphere [02:28:26].

In 1970, the Pentagon canceled further SR-71 orders and ordered the destruction of its titanium tooling [02:14:30]. This, along with losing the F-16 fighter contract to General Dynamics in 1972 (though Lockheed later acquired this business), led to layoffs at Skunk Works [02:15:00]. Lockheed's attempts to enter commercial aviation with the L-1011 airliner resulted in a $2.5 billion loss [02:18:07]. The company also faced bribery scandals and costly military projects like the C5 Galaxy transport plane, leading to a government bailout in the 1970s [02:18:55].

## The Modern Era: Consolidation and New Frontiers
In the mid-1970s, Skunk Works revived its fortunes by developing the F-117A Nighthawk, the first operational stealth fighter [02:21:01]. Based on a Russian mathematical paper, Dennis Overholser, a Skunk Works mathematician, applied equations to design an aircraft that would be almost invisible on radar [02:21:17]. Despite initial skepticism from Kelly Johnson, the "Hopeless Diamond" (code name: Have Blue) prototype proved effective, with a radar signature smaller than an eighth-inch ball bearing [02:23:04].

The F-117A's unique, angular design, reminiscent of early 3D video game graphics, made it unstable to fly without a "fly-by-wire" computer system that translated pilot inputs into stabilized movements [02:29:06]. Lockheed Martin even co-developed the Sega Model 3 arcade board to model stealth airplanes [02:51:29].

The Nighthawk made its combat debut in the Gulf War during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, flying 1% of air missions but accounting for 40% of all damaged targets [02:32:58]. The F-117A remained classified for 21 years [02:33:55].

The end of the Cold War led to massive defense budget cuts and a direct instruction from Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry in 1993 for major defense contractors to consolidate [02:35:10]. This period, dubbed "the Last Supper" by Martin Marietta's CEO, led to a wave of mergers and acquisitions [02:36:13].

In 1995, Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta, forming [[lockheed_martin_history | Lockheed Martin]] [02:39:00]. This new entity quickly acquired other defense businesses, becoming a "Franken-company" composed of 17 previously independent entities [02:44:22]. An attempted merger with Northrop Grumman in 1997 was blocked by the Department of Justice to preserve competition [02:41:00].

Modern aerospace programs, like the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II, are characterized by immense scale, long development timelines, and high costs. The F-22 program, initially for 750 planes at $44 billion, ended up delivering 187 planes for $62 billion, making each plane cost $360 million due to amortized R&D [02:48:11]. This "piecemeal manufacturing approach," as Ben Rich noted, involves thousands of subcontractors across many states, intertwining military spending with job creation and political incentives [02:52:58].

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is the largest ever purchase of defense equipment among U.S. and its allies [02:57:42]. The initial order book was for approximately 3,000 airplanes worth a potential $200 billion [02:56:21]. The F-35 prioritizes [[technology_infrastructure_evolution | technology]] and information-based warfare, featuring intense communications and advanced heads-up displays, representing a shift towards a future of drone and cybersecurity [02:55:38].

[[lockheed_martin_history | Lockheed Martin]] today is a diversified conglomerate with four main segments: Aeronautics (F-35, F-22, F-16), Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems (helicopters, including Sikorsky), and Space (Orion Capsule, ULA joint venture with Boeing) [03:09:44]. Its revenues are largely from the U.S. federal government (75%) and allies, with an average net income margin of 8% [03:01:23].

The relationship between the defense industry and the government is unique; it's not a free market but a system designed to maintain national defense capabilities [03:19:11]. While this ensures a strong industrial base and trained workforce (a jobs program) [03:22:05], it also leads to less competition and high costs due to "Cost Plus" contracts [03:02:06]. This contrasts with the agile, risk-taking, and rapid iteration mindset of early Skunk Works, which directly inspired Silicon Valley's approach to innovation [03:27:01]. While modern warfare may shift towards software, the traditional defense industry struggles to adapt its business model to this, highlighting a potential future disconnect between innovation and procurement [03:05:17].

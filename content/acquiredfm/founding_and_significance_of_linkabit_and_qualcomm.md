Linkabit, an early technology company, was co-founded by Irwin Jacobs and Andrew "Andy" Viterbi. Though not initially intended to be a "real company," it played a pivotal role in the early development of digital communications and satellite technology, eventually paving the way for future ventures like [[qualcomms_history_and_evolution|Qualcomm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Irwin Jacobs: Early Life and Education

Irwin Mark Jacobs, an American born in 1933 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, demonstrated a strong aptitude for math and sciences from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Despite a high school guidance counselor's advice that there was "no future for Math and Science in New Bedford" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, Jacobs pursued higher education. He initially enrolled in the Cornell School of Hotel Management at the encouragement of his counselor, with the idea of working in his family's restaurant, the Boston Beef Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

Jacobs credits his year and a half in hotel management for providing him with an understanding of business accounting and real-world applications, which he found enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. He later transferred to electrical engineering, recognizing the demand and financial opportunities in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. He went on to earn a PhD in electrical engineering from MIT in just three years, completing it in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. His doctoral studies were conducted under the mentorship of Claude Shannon, the "father of information theory," whose influence was crucial to Jacobs' future contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

After his PhD, Jacobs taught at MIT for five years, during which he taught the world's first course on digital communications and co-authored the first textbook on the subject, still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of Linkabit

In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical to work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California, focusing on the U.S. Space Program and satellite communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Here, he met Andrew Viterbi, another MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. The two became close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

Shortly after his sabbatical, Jacobs was invited to establish the electrical engineering department at the newly formed UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. He accepted and moved to San Diego, continuing his consulting work with defense contractors and JPL on a part-time basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

The idea for Linkabit emerged from a flight conversation between Jacobs, Viterbi, and a third professor from UCLA, Len Kleinrock. They were all doing consulting work for NASA Ames and found it challenging to balance with their academic responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. They decided to form a "shell company" to manage their consulting work, aiming for efficiencies and the ability to hire assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. They explicitly stated they did not intend it to be a "real company" that made products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. The name "Linkabit" was a tongue-in-cheek academic joke about "linking a bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

While Kleinrock, one of the "core founding fathers of the internet" through his work on the ARPANET project, later left Linkabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>, Jacobs and Viterbi continued their partnership.

## Early Projects and Commercial Shift

Linkabit initially focused on NASA and Navy defense projects, primarily in satellite communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. Their expertise lay in finding efficient ways to use narrow bandwidth channels for communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. They utilized "spread spectrum technology," an old patented technology from the World War II era invented by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

The company began attracting other professors and grad students, building an "Army of the greatest information Theory and wireless signal Minds in the country," all for defense contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. By 1971, Linkabit had grown so much that Irwin Jacobs took a sabbatical from UCSD to organize the company, eventually never returning to academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

Linkabit's strategic direction shifted when they realized that prime defense contractors were making all the money while Linkabit was doing the "differentiated engineering work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. They decided to start bidding on contracts themselves and move into the commercial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

Linkabit's first major commercial project was designing the satellite communication system for Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. This project involved enabling Walmart's eccentric founder, Sam Walton, to broadcast messages from headquarters to all local stores and facilitate data transmission for inventory and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. This highlights Walmart's innovation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, investing tens of millions into a private satellite relay due to insufficient internet bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

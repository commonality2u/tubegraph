[[Qualcomms founding and early history | Qualcomm]] played a pivotal role in the [[development_of_cdma_technology | development of CDMA technology]] and its subsequent adoption as a global telecommunications standard.

## Early Adoption and Market Penetration

The [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] standard was adopted as a major 2G standard for new phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
In the US, [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] achieved a 57% market share in 2G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
It secured 100% market share in countries like South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
[[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] also gained massive market share in China, as the country was adopting mobile communication for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The first [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] networks went live in the US and internationally in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Transition to 3G and Worldwide Dominance

Initially, there was a debate in the US between GSM and [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] for 3G networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. However, all 3G technologies ultimately became [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]], including different flavors of the standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] "ran the table" worldwide with [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] in 3G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

The primary reason for [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]]'s dominance in 3G was its vastly superior capability for high-speed data and broadband internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. As digital information like websites, iMessages, and tweets are already in packet form, [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]]'s digital infrastructure was perfectly suited for these applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Evolution Beyond CDMA

While [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] was a "knight in shining armor" against previous technologies, its claims for future-proofing and evolution did not fully hold up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. By 2005, [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] was a 20-year-old technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

In 2005, [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] acquired Flarian Technologies for $600 million, primarily for its patents that would become essential for 4G technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This acquisition allowed [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] to continue its business model, as it now owned many patents required for 4G and LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

The 4G standard, OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), was more efficient than [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Initially, [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] resisted OFDMA, trying to maintain [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] as the 4G standard, but eventually pivoted to adopt OFDMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

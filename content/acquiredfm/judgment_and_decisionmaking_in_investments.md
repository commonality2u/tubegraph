This article explores the nuanced world of investment judgment and decision-making, drawing insights from legendary value investor Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, and his son Andrew Marks, co-founder of TQ Ventures. Their differing yet complementary investment styles—Howard's value-oriented approach and Andrew's growth-focused tech investing—offer a rich perspective on how judgment evolves in the dynamic landscape of finance.

## Two Investment Philosophies, One Core Principle

Howard and Andrew Marks, father and son, represent distinct but interconnected [[investment_philosophies_and_business_strategies | investment philosophies]]. Howard, known for his "famous memos" and books, is a proponent of value investing and co-founded Oaktree Capital Management, a firm specializing in alternative investments with $159 billion in assets under management as of June 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>. Andrew, on the other hand, co-founded TQ Ventures, an early-stage venture firm that has amassed $1 billion under management in just five years, with top-decile returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

Their collaborative memo, "Something of Value," became Howard's most popular memo ever, debating value investing versus growth investing during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This collaboration highlighted their differences in mindset, shaped by their respective experiences and the evolution of markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Investment Evaluation

### Beyond Traditional Value Metrics
Andrew Marks's journey into growth investing involved understanding how to reinvest maintenance cash flow at high rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. This concept, also discussed by Warren Buffett as "owner earnings," extends beyond the cash flow statement to include investments in high-return sales, talented engineering teams, and R&D, which appear on the income statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

Amazon is presented as a prime example of a company that defied traditional value metrics. A typical value investor might have focused solely on the income statement, seeing Amazon as perpetually "losing money" or a "charity run for the benefit of the American consumer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. However, Andrew points out that Amazon actually had a "very favorable cash conversion cycle," making it sound from a free cash flow perspective much earlier than its income statement suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>. This illustrates the need to "dive in and understand things" rather than making "knee-jerk 30,000-foot view" conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.

### The Role of Management and Optionality
Amazon also highlights the importance of betting on "an amazing founder who can leverage their business to create value in really compelling other ways," even if those ways are unimagined at the outset (e.g., AWS from a retail story) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. This represents an "optionality" that growth investors embrace, seeing "losses sometimes as the right thing in the interest of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>. This contrasts with deep value investors who primarily seek to maximize current cash flow and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.

### [[future_uncertainties_in_investment_and_company_evaluation | Future Uncertainties]] and Disruption
The past provided a "consistent backdrop" where the world didn't change much, and industries like newspapers seemed "impregnable" due to local monopolies and recurring demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:32:00">[28:32:00]</a>. However, this stability has eroded with "technological adoption speeding up," making companies less durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>. The concept of "disruption was never considered" in the past, leading to the downfall of seemingly strong companies like Xerox or Simplicity Patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

The increased uncertainty about the future, coupled with globally addressable and strategically adjacent markets (like Amazon expanding from books to cloud computing), creates a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:34:00">[31:34:00]</a>. While moats are less permanent, the ability for companies to leverage competitive advantages to "build more" and dominate markets has never been higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>.

## The Pursuit of Advantage in Efficient Markets

The [[evaluating_investments_using_discounted_cash_flow_dcf | discounted cash flow]] (DCF) formula underpins all equity investments, requiring judgments about future cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>. However, modern markets have become increasingly efficient. The Efficient Market Hypothesis, which posits that "everything is priced right," has become "more true" over time due to the ubiquity of information, algorithms, and smart people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[35:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18:00">[35:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:22:00">[34:22:00]</a>.

In this "zero-sum game," gaining a [[investment_strategies_and_decisionmaking_at_yc | knowledge advantage]] or [[evaluating_judgment_in_venture_investment | skill advantage]] is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>. Readily available quantitative information about the present is no longer enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:57:00">[41:57:00]</a>. Instead, investors must excel at making [[longterm_qualitative_judgments_in_venture_investing | qualitative judgments about the future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:00">[42:06:00]</a>. This requires:
*   **Deep understanding:** Frameworks for what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:50">[0:51:50]</a>.
*   **Rationality:** Thinking logically and avoiding emotional biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:28">[0:52:28]</a>.
*   **Intellectual humility:** Recognizing the possibility of being wrong and knowing what one doesn't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:45">[0:52:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:52">[0:52:52]</a>.
*   **Second-level thinking:** Thinking differently and "more correct[ly]" than the consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:34">[0:51:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:39">[0:51:39]</a>.

## Personal Fit and Investment Style

The Marks' agree that [[building_and_managing_investment_firms | successful investing]] involves finding a strategy that "plays to your strengths and avoids your weaknesses" and that you "enjoy doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:12:00">[56:12:12]</a>. Howard, being conservative and risk-averse, gravitated towards credit investing, avoiding the "too hard pile" of unpredictable tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:29:00">[40:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:46:00">[41:46:00]</a>. Andrew, an optimist and futurist, thrives in venture investing, where he enjoys "hunting for founders" and making long-term, qualitative judgments about future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:15:00">[38:15:00]</a>.

Venture is a "probabilistic endeavor" where one seeks "extremely high expected value investments," even if the average outcome is losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:54:00">[38:54:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional value investing's focus on avoiding "permanent capital loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:26:00">[39:26:00]</a>.

### The Conundrum of [[balancing_confidence_and_open_mindedness_in_investment | Balancing Confidence and Open-mindedness]]
Investing presents a paradox:
*   **Confidence:** Essential to back "iffy" things and "stay with them if they go bad," even buying more when they decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:30:00">[58:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:45:00">[58:45:00]</a>.
*   **Open-mindedness:** Crucial to avoid rigidity and be willing to change strategies and thinking as markets evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:12]</a>.

The ability to "see differently and better" is what ultimately leads to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:44">[1:08:44]</a>. As David Swenson, the late Yale endowment manager, put it, one must be willing to do things that are "uncomfortably idiosyncratic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:51">[1:08:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:00">[1:09:00]</a>.

## [[evaluating_judgment_in_venture_investment | Evaluating Judgment]] in People

In venture capital, the "vast vast majority of the investment consideration is backing the right people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:51">[1:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:57">[1:04:57]</a>. Andrew emphasizes evaluating a founder's judgment by delving into their past decisions, why they made them, and whether they learned and evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:28">[1:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:01">[1:06:01]</a>. Key qualities include:
*   Making decisions based on "first principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:09">[1:06:09]</a>.
*   Willingness to "go against the herd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:11">[1:06:11]</a>.
*   Passion derived from "specific knowledge of a real problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:16">[1:06:16]</a>.
*   Being "a weirdo" in a specific area, meaning "four standard deviations from the mean at that thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:03">[1:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:08">[1:07:08]</a>.
*   Ability to "think for yourself" and have "real conviction" when there's "not much of a map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:49">[1:07:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:50">[1:07:50]</a>.

This belief in the power of exceptional individuals is underscored by the idea that even the "best startup idea" (like Google's PageRank algorithm) would fail without "exceptional people who can exhibit exceptional judgment" and "attract and retain other exceptional people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:18">[1:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:44">[1:09:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:04">[1:10:04]</a>.

## The Art of Selling

Selling decisions are often driven by emotions like avoiding regret or embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:57">[1:19:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:01">[1:20:01]</a>. Howard admits his past "terribly misguided feeling that if you sell half you can't be all wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:58">[1:17:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:01">[1:18:01]</a>. However, this mindset fails to capitalize on "compounding certificates" or "generational companies" that can grow 100x or 10,000x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:20">[1:22:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:34">[1:22:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:39">[1:22:39]</a>.

Andrew suggests that selling decisions should be based on:
*   **Deep understanding** of the investment's original thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:15">[1:20:15]</a>.
*   **Opportunity cost** (where the money would go if sold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:31">[1:20:31]</a>.
*   Whether the value proposition has fundamentally changed, not merely on "price action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:52">[1:20:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:12">[1:21:12]</a>.

For investments with capped upside, like bonds, taking profits is more responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:24:23">[1:24:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:24:37">[1:24:37]</a>. However, for "truly generational companies," selling early is a "colossal mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:24:42">[1:24:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:24:50">[1:24:50]</a>. The ultimate test is confidence in the future and the fundamental reason for holding the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:23:32">[1:23:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, all [[investment_strategies_and_decisionmaking_at_yc | investment decisions]] boil down to judgment, which cannot be reduced to an algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:14">[1:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:31">[1:01:31]</a>. It's a combination of deep knowledge, rationality, intellectual humility, and "second-level thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:02:14">[1:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:02:21">[1:02:21]</a>. In a world of increasing complexity and rapid change, where "everything changes every minute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a>, successful investors must continually evolve their thinking, avoid rigidity, and embrace open-mindedness while staying true to their unique strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:56:00">[56:56:00]</a>.

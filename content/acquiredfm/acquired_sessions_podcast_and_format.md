[[acquired_podcasts_unique_format_and_episode_structure | Acquired Sessions]] is a distinct podcast format produced by the creators of the main *Acquired* show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It is explicitly described as a "new format" that the hosts are experimenting with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:54">[02:11:54]</a>.

## Format and Purpose

Unlike the heavily scripted main *Acquired* episodes, which can run up to four hours long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, [[acquired_podcasts_unique_format_and_episode_structure | Acquired Sessions]] is designed to be an unscripted, informal conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The concept is to "throw out the script and just chop it up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, akin to an "MTV Unplugged" style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. There is "no agenda" for these discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The goal of this format is to go deep into topics with guests who are well-known to the hosts and potentially to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It provides an opportunity to have repeat guests on the show in a more casual setting, allowing for deeper, less structured conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:15">[02:08:15]</a>.

## Guests and Discussion

The first [[acquired_podcasts_unique_format_and_episode_structure | Acquired Sessions]] episode featured Jason Calacanis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:52">[02:11:52]</a>, who has been a frequent guest on other podcasts by the hosts, such as "This Week in Startups" (TWiST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. The format allows for personal anecdotes, detailed career reflections, and insights into the guest's current endeavors, such as Calacanis's work with Founder University and his angel investing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>.

The dynamic of [[acquired_podcasts_unique_format_and_episode_structure | Acquired Sessions]] encourages open dialogue, including lighthearted banter and personal stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. The hosts seek feedback on the format from their audience via email (`acquiredfm@gmail.com`) and Twitter (`@acquiredFM`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:56">[02:21:56]</a>.

## Sponsorship

The podcast `Acquired`, which delves into the stories and playbooks behind major technology companies, hosts a special episode featuring Brian Koppelman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, creators of the Showtime series "Super Pumped." The conversation evaluates the complex relationship between compelling storytelling and the often-disruptive culture of the business world, particularly within Silicon Valley.

## Venture Capitalism as Pop Culture
The show "Super Pumped," which dramatizes the story of Uber leading up to its IPO, highlights a surreal shift where the world of venture capital and startups has become part of mainstream entertainment and pop culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>. Brian Koppelman, an executive producer and showrunner for "Super Pumped," notes the unique position of a venture capitalist like Bill Gurley being a primary character in a major television series, a concept unimaginable a decade prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>.

## The Cost of Disruption and Unfettered Growth
A central theme explored in "Super Pumped" is the prevailing business mentality that prioritizes "profits above all" and "shareholder value up before everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who stars as Travis Kalanick, explains his attraction to playing a character who "just goes as hard as he can into that animal instinct," reflecting a part of human nature that most people don't indulge due to consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:59">[01:36:59]</a>.

Brian Koppelman emphasizes the show's exploration of [[The cultural impact of venture capitalism and disruption | disruption]] and its associated costs: "Is the convenience worth what's on the other side of the ledger?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>. He questions whether revolutionaries, in unseating existing systems, can avoid becoming "fascists" themselves, referencing Hannah Arendt's idea of "lost treasure in the revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>. The Uber story, as depicted in the series, serves as a prime example for raising these critical questions about contemporary American culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>.

The hosts note the cultural fascination with individuals who "put it all on the line," stepping up to make bold decisions, whether in finance or entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>. This aligns with [[Insights into investing and business development | insights into investing and business development]].

## Storytelling as a Cautionary Tale
The creators aim for the series to be a cautionary tale rather than a glorification of questionable behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:59">[02:08:59]</a>. Gordon-Levitt emphasizes the need to portray a "whole human" rather than reducing Kalanick to headlines, aiming to show both inspiring and compelling aspects alongside arguably unethical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:59">[02:08:59]</a>. He believes that while a confident character might be "instantly winning" to an audience, the show's "unflinching" portrayal of shortcomings and dark moments should lead the majority to see it as a warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>.

Koppelman shares a similar perspective, drawing parallels to films like "The Wolf of Wall Street," where the initial "glitter" eventually reveals the "emptiness" and "cost" of the protagonist's choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. He states that artists must be attracted to compelling questions and tell stories rigorously and truthfully, trusting that the audience will eventually understand their intended message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. The goal is to "shine a light on what it means to be that kind of guy and what we're saying as a society when we prop up people who have incredible verbal acuity and great math skills and the ability to galvanize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.

## Art vs. Business: A Continuum
The discussion delves into the fundamental differences between an artist's role and a business person's role. An artist's job is to "make people feel something and ask questions," while a business person's job is to "provide the answers" by creating value for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>.

However, a continuum exists where individuals can transition from artistic visionaries to shrewd business operators. The hosts cite Marc Andreessen, who, with Mosaic, was an "artist" changing the world with a vision for how it should be, but then became an "incredible business person" as priorities shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:55">[02:53:55]</a>. This reflects [[Impact of technology on business | the impact of technology on business]] and [[Business strategies and history | business strategies and history]]. Garrett Camp, a co-founder of Uber, is also described as an "artist" whose previous company, StumbleUpon, was more of an "art project" than a viable business, highlighting how artistic impulses can intersect with the need for commercial viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:02">[03:12:02]</a>.

The show itself employs unconventional storytelling techniques to reflect its subject matter. For instance, it plays with apocryphal founding stories versus factual events, leveraging the concept of [[The cultural impact of venture capitalism and disruption | disruption]] in its narrative form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:15">[03:36:15]</a>.

## The Artistic Process and Truth
The creators relied heavily on Mike Isaac's book for source material, with Isaac actively participating in the writer's room daily, even facilitating off-the-record conversations with sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>. Gordon-Levitt also conducted his own research, speaking to people who worked closely with Travis Kalanick to understand his personal nuances beyond public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:59">[02:08:59]</a>.

The challenge of acting in a green-screened environment, pretending to watch something while focusing on emotional truth, is compared to a child's imaginative play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:05">[04:43:05]</a>. The true difficulty, according to Gordon-Levitt, lies in maintaining that "childlike spirit of imagination" amidst the logistical chaos of a film set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:05">[04:43:05]</a>.

Both Koppelman and Gordon-Levitt speak to the importance of intrinsic motivation in creative work. Koppelman recalls an early career experience where bad reviews for his first movie led him to realize that only the quality of the work and the commitment to collaborators truly mattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:12">[05:11:12]</a>. Gordon-Levitt references Rainer Maria Rilke's "Letters to a Young Poet," emphasizing the need for artists to delve deep into themselves to find their unique voice, unconcerned with external validation or commercial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:20">[05:39:20]</a>. This principle, akin to Ralph Waldo Emerson's concept of self-reliance, suggests that courageously expressing innermost truth will resonate with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:23">[05:42:23]</a>.

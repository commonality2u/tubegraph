The unique tradition of the Benchmark Dinner originated from an optimistic desire to inject new practices and ideas into the firm, particularly through nurturing curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This tradition is so central to [[history_and_strategy_of_benchmark_capital | Benchmark]] that the firm maintains a dedicated dining room on the 19th floor of its office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Inspiration and Early Experimentation

The idea for the dinners was sparked by [[key_figures_in_early_benchmark_capital | Bill Gurley]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, who, upon joining [[history_and_strategy_of_benchmark_capital | Benchmark]], had just read the biography of [[Influences from Benjamin Franklins Dinners | Benjamin Franklin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Franklin reportedly held four dinners a week, each focused on a different deep topic such as finance, chemistry, or life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This inspired Gurley to ask, "Why aren't we doing dinners?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

An initial "playful experiment" was conducted with a big dinner towards the end of 2006 or 2007, specifically in 2006, which was Peter's first year at the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This inaugural dinner, attended by four outside guests—Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos—was described as "amazing" and "electric," making time "stand still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Philosophy and Purpose

The core concept behind the dinners is that firms are driven by habits, as proposed by William James, who believed humans are an "amalgamation of our habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Therefore, the dinner tradition was established as a habit to nurture curiosity, which is considered the "essential lifeblood" of the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The dynamic range of a dinner, unlike typical office meetings, allows for "open-ended No Agenda wild explorations" of various topics that partners might be curious about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It fosters a "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved in one-on-one settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### The Unique Table Design

A significant element supporting the dinner's philosophy is its distinctive table. Rectangular tables embed a power structure, while circular tables can atomize a group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Inspired by a design by French designer Jean-Marie Massaud, the [[history_and_strategy_of_benchmark_capital | Benchmark]] table was ultimately designed by Ole Lundberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The table's organic, expandable, and collapsible form is specifically designed to "destruct or deconstruct power centers" and create a "non-hierarchical construct with intimacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Crucially, the table's design prevents sidebar conversations, ensuring that "everybody else can hear it" and that "it's all one conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This "one conversation element" is seen as "so powerful" because it keeps the entire group "tuned in on whatever's being discussed," regardless of whether it's good, bad, or tough news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## [[Guest Selection and Significance at Benchmark Dinners | Guest Selection and Impact]]

The Benchmark Dinners frequently host highly esteemed guests, often individuals the firm has not yet worked with or invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This provides "the spotlight of attention," which is considered the "biggest gift you can give to another human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Notable guests have included Dylan Field of Figma, Toby from Shopify, and even Jeff Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These interactions can be profoundly impactful, leading to the realization, "this is why we exist to serve people like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. While the table is not portable, dinners have been held in other locations like Los Angeles and Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Contrast with Traditional Venture Firm Practices

The one-conversation rule of the Benchmark Dinner stands in stark contrast to traditional venture capital partner meetings. An anecdote recalls an older partner advising a junior venture capitalist to have "side conversation[s] with everybody else before you bring it up at the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Conversely, [[key_figures_in_early_benchmark_capital | Bruce Dunleavy]], an early partner, stated that [[history_and_strategy_of_benchmark_capital | Benchmark]]'s one rule was "no pre-selling a deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, reinforcing the firm's ethos of open, collective discussion.

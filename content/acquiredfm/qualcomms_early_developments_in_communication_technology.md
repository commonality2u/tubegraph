## Linkabit's Foundational Work

Before the establishment of [[formation_and_strategic_vision_of_qualcomm | Qualcomm]], its founders, Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi, were instrumental in the success of Linkabit, a company that pioneered advanced communication solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Linkabit's early work included developing a video scrambling system for pay TV on cable systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system addressed a critical issue where early cable systems, using a "security by obscurity" approach, allowed mildly technical users to access channels like HBO for free by manipulating their cable boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. [[founding_and_significance_of_linkabit_and_qualcomm | Linkabit]] successfully solved this problem, leading to its adoption by HBO and other major pay-TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

In 1980, after a decade of operation, [[founding_and_significance_of_linkabit_and_qualcomm | Linkabit]] was acquired by M/A-COM, an East Coast radio technology company, for $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. By this time, Linkabit had grown significantly, eventually reaching over 1,500 employees within M/A-COM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Although the sale was a "nice early win" for the former academics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, the founders later recognized it as a mistake given the company's subsequent growth and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, this sale was also crucial as it paved the way for the establishment of [[formation_and_strategic_vision_of_qualcomm | Qualcomm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Founding of Qualcomm

After a leadership change at M/A-COM, Jacobs, Viterbi, and five other top [[founding_and_significance_of_linkabit_and_qualcomm | Linkabit]] engineers left the company in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Recognizing the nascent and growing wireless communications industry, they decided to found a new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. In July 1985, meeting at Irwin Jacobs's house, they established [[formation_and_strategic_vision_of_qualcomm | Qualcomm]], an acronym for "Quality Communications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The name reflected their commitment to providing higher-quality communications than anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

At this time, the cellular telephone industry was in its infancy, characterized by 1G analog networks that primarily supported car phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. These systems were essentially high-power FM radio broadcasters requiring significant power, typically from a car's engine, and were extremely expensive, costing thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Bandwidth was severely limited, and demand for car phones far outstripped supply, leading to years-long waitlists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Strategic Vision and Early Projects

The founders of [[formation_and_strategic_vision_of_qualcomm | Qualcomm]], combining their academic brilliance with keen market analysis, saw the immense opportunity in the mobile communications market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Their initial [[strategic_shifts_in_qualcomms_business_model_and_partnerships | business strategy]] was twofold:
1.  **Massive Opportunity:** To bring terrestrial cell phone networks into the digital era and become a dominant player in this burgeoning industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
2.  **Bootstrap:** To initially perform consulting work, much like [[founding_and_significance_of_linkabit_and_qualcomm | Linkabit]] had done, to build capital and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

One of their first consulting projects was with Hughes, a defense prime, on a proposal to the FCC for a mobile satellite network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This project involved optimizing satellite communication channels for efficiency, dealing with "Jurassic Park sat phones" that were bulky and expensive but crucial for remote communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Breakthrough: Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

While working on the satellite project, [[formation_and_strategic_vision_of_qualcomm | Qualcomm]] developed an application of "spread spectrum" technology known as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This innovation allowed multiple conversations to access the same channels simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

To understand CDMA, it's important to contrast it with previous technologies:
*   **Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA):** This was the analog model, where each conversation occupied its own distinct frequency, like radio stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This was highly inefficient, as it limited the number of simultaneous communications due to interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA):** This digital approach allowed multiple conversations to share a single frequency by parceling information into digital packets and rotating the time slots when different packets were sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. This was an improvement, offering 3 to 5 times more capacity than FDMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Europe, led by Ericsson, was largely adopting this standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### The CDMA Innovation
Inspired by principles of information theory from Claude Shannon and the packet-switching nature of the early internet, [[formation_and_strategic_vision_of_qualcomm | Qualcomm]]'s founders realized an even more efficient method was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. CDMA allows everybody to send their digital conversations simultaneously across all channels by appending a unique "code" to each conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. The recipient's device then decodes the signal, disregarding other "noise" and reassembling only the messages matching its specific code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

This concept is likened to a "dinner party" where everyone speaks in their own language simultaneously; listeners only focus on the language they understand, effectively filtering out other conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Technically, digital messages are encoded with a unique pattern (e.g., 10010) and layered on top of each other in the same digital signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. The receiving end knows how to subtract the specific code to extract the desired message, allowing for maximum efficient use of all allocated spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## The CDMA Patent and its Significance

In 1986, years before [[formation_and_strategic_vision_of_qualcomm | Qualcomm]] directly entered the cellular industry, they patented the method and technique for CDMA applied to terrestrial cellular networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. This patent, U.S. Patent Number 4,901,307 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>, became one of the most valuable [[qualcomms_legal_challenges_and_patents_in_the_mobile_industry | patents]] in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

The value of the CDMA patent lay in its ability to allow users to broadcast messages across all available frequencies simultaneously, with the receiving technology capable of deciphering the intended communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Crucially, this method did not require super high power, making it energy-efficient and suitable for portable devices, unlike earlier car phones that needed an internal combustion engine to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. CDMA presented a far more efficient way to utilize a given medium for the absolute maximum amount of conversations or signal transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. This strategic execution of entering the market is considered one of the most brilliant in [[qualcomms_history_and_evolution | business history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

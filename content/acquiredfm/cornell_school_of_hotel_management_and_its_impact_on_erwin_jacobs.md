[[erwin_mark_jacobs_early_life_and_education | Erwin Mark Jacobs]], an American born in 1933 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, began his higher education in an unexpected field for a future engineering pioneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. New Bedford, once the wealthiest town in America during the whaling era, had a history tied to companies like Hathaway Manufacturing, which later merged with [[entrepreneurial_lessons_from_warren_buffett_and_berkshire_hathaway | Berkshire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. By 1933, however, it was no longer the thriving whaling hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## An Unexpected Academic Path

[[erwin_mark_jacobs_early_life_and_education | Jacobs]] grew up in a very middle-class family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. His father worked multiple jobs and eventually managed a local restaurant called the Boston Beef Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Although [[erwin_mark_jacobs_early_life_and_education | Erwin]] was highly gifted in math and sciences throughout school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> and wanted to study these subjects, his high school guidance counselor advised him that there was "no future for Math and Science in New Bedford" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Given the economic realities of New Bedford at the time, this advice was likely accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

With excellent grades, [[erwin_mark_jacobs_early_life_and_education | Jacobs]] was encouraged by his counselor to attend the "world famous Cornell School of hotel management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The intention was for him to learn hospitality management and return to work in the family business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Learning Business Beyond Engineering

Despite being an "engineering genius" and a future "American Pioneer of the wireless and Communications industry," [[erwin_mark_jacobs_early_life_and_education | Erwin Jacobs]] initially pursued hotel management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He spent a year and a half in the hotel management program at Cornell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This period proved unexpectedly valuable:
*   He learned about "business accounting" and "real world applications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   He discovered that he "kind of loved that too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

This foundational business knowledge, gained in a non-technical field, was something [[erwin_mark_jacobs_early_life_and_education | Jacobs]] would later credit as crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Transition to Electrical Engineering

After realizing that math and science were "in demand" and could lead to financial opportunities outside of New Bedford, [[erwin_mark_jacobs_early_life_and_education | Jacobs]] decided to transfer to electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. When he approached the dean at Cornell to request the transfer from hotel management to electrical engineering, the dean's incredulous response was, "Oh you mean electrical engineering to hotel management right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. [[erwin_mark_jacobs_early_life_and_education | Jacobs]] insisted he wanted to do the "hard stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Despite the dean's suspicion, the transfer was allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Lasting Influence on Entrepreneurship

The year and a half [[erwin_mark_jacobs_early_life_and_education | Erwin Jacobs]] spent in hotel management before transferring to electrical engineering was not a detour, but a critical part of his development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. He would later credit this experience with helping him "get out of Academia and become an entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Specifically, he cited it as a key factor in starting his first company, Linkabit, and subsequently, Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Later in his career, while engaging in consulting work with Linkabit, [[erwin_mark_jacobs_early_life_and_education | Jacobs]] continued to "exercis[e] the like hotel management sort of side of his brain," finding that he genuinely enjoyed the business aspects of his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This foundation in business and real-world applications, initially cultivated in the Cornell School of Hotel Management, was instrumental in his successful transition from an academic genius to a pioneering entrepreneur in the wireless communications industry.

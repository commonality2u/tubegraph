## Introduction
Sony Corporation is a major [[history of technology companies | technology company]] that [[Steve Jobs and Sony Influence | Steve Jobs]] idolized and modeled Apple Computer after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This influence extended to [[Steve Jobs and Sony Influence | Jobs]]'s personal style; he adopted the black turtleneck after seeing [[company profiles like Nvidia Amazon and Sony | Sony]] employees' uniforms, which were originally a necessity due to clothing scarcity after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Founding in Post-WWII Japan
The [[history of technology companies | company]]'s origins trace back to the summer of 1944 in Tokyo, Japan, during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Two engineers, Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita, were reluctantly assigned to a military task force to create a heat-seeking missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Both Ibuka and Morita believed the war was a terrible thing and recognized America's superior technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. [[Akio Morita]], the junior engineer, hailed from a prominent family that controlled one of Japan's largest sake empires for 400 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Despite his family's expectation for him to take over the business, [[Akio Morita]] pursued physics and engineering due to his fascination with American technology like radios and phonographs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

After Japan's surrender in August 1945, which [[Akio Morita]] foresaw due to his understanding of the atomic bomb, [[Masaru Ibuka]] returned to Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. [[Masaru Ibuka]] founded the Tokyo Telecommunications Research Institute with the purpose of creating a stable workplace for engineers to pursue technology and social obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Initially, they struggled to find a product, failing with an electric rice cooker and a heating blanket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. Their first success came from repairing and modifying radios, particularly re-enabling shortwave reception which had been made illegal by the Japanese government during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

[[Akio Morita]] read about Ibuka's venture in a newspaper and joined the company, even though he wasn't among the initial engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. His family provided the initial investment of 190,000 yen and eventually owned 17% of the [[Challenging Times and Turnaround of Sony | company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

## Rise to Prominence with Consumer Electronics
### Tape Recorders and Transistor Radios
In 1949, [[Masaru Ibuka]] was captivated by an American tape recorder and decided the [[history of technology companies | company]] should make them, including the tape itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. These early tape recorders were large, table-sized machines primarily for recording audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation (TTEC), as the [[history of technology companies | company]] was then known, initially found a market by replacing stenographers in the Japanese court system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

A major [[Sonys Major Technological Innovations | technological innovation]] came in 1952 when [[Masaru Ibuka]] learned that Bell Labs (parent company Western Electric) would open its transistor technology for international licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. Despite Bell Labs' suggestion that transistors were only suitable for hearing aids, [[Akio Morita]] negotiated a license in 1953, believing they could create miniature radios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.

In August 1955, TTEC released their first transistor radio, the TR-55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. Before its release, they chose the new name "Sony" from the Latin word "sonus" (sound) and the American slang "sunny boy," aiming for a name that would appeal to young people and work globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

The TR-63, released two years later, was a massive hit, selling 1.5 million units at $25 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. [[Akio Morita]] famously turned down a huge order from Bulova Watch Company to brand the radios as "Bulova TR-63," insisting on "Sony TR-63" to build the [[company profiles like Nvidia Amazon and Sony | Sony]] brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. This decision was crucial in establishing [[Sony's Business and Market Strategy | Sony's global brand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. In 1960, [[Sony Corporation of America]] was established, with [[Akio Morita]] moving to New York City to set it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. His move was unusual for a Japanese CEO and helped bridge business relations between Japan and America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

### Trinitron Televisions
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, as color television became prominent, [[Sony]] invested years in developing a superior color TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. [[Masaru Ibuka]] personally led a team to create the Trinitron, an electron gun system that vastly improved color picture quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. Despite initial high manufacturing costs, the Trinitron was a huge success, making [[Sony]] the number one TV manufacturer globally for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.

### Betamax and the Format War
In 1975, [[Sony]] introduced the Betamax video recording technology, the first consumer video cassette recorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. Its initial killer feature was "time shifting" â€“ recording TV programs to watch later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. However, this led to a major lawsuit in November 1976 when MCA Universal sued [[Sony]] for enabling copyright infringement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>. The lawsuit, while boosting Betamax sales initially through free publicity, ultimately contributed to its demise as other manufacturers developed competing formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>. MCA Universal, angered by [[Sony]], exclusively partnered with Matsushita (Panasonic/JVC) and their VHS format, which offered longer recording times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>.

## Diversification and Content
### Music and Compact Discs
In 1966, [[Akio Morita]] pursued a joint venture with CBS to access the Japanese recorded music market, leading to the creation of CBS/Sony Records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>. This JV became incredibly profitable, eventually becoming the most profitable division for both [[Sony]] and CBS within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. Norio Ohga, a classically trained musician who would later become [[Sony]]'s CEO, was put in charge of CBS/Sony Records, turning it into a "geyser of cash flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.

In 1980, [[Sony]] and Philips (a Dutch company with whom [[Sony]] had a cross-licensing deal since 1966) announced the Compact Disc (CD) format, a result of years of collaborative work on digital audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. In 1982, [[Sony]] released the first CD player, and by 1986, CDs became the dominant recording format, surpassing records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

### The Walkman
A pivotal [[Sonys Major Technological Innovations | innovation]] was the Walkman, conceived by [[Akio Morita]] as a portable cassette player without recording capabilities or external speakers, using low-power headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>. Despite internal skepticism and the threat of [[Akio Morita]]'s resignation if it failed, the first Walkman, released in Japan in July 1979, sold out its initial 30,000 units in one month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>. The Walkman fundamentally changed consumer behavior, allowing millions of people to listen to music privately on the go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. [[Sony]] ultimately sold a quarter billion Walkman units globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. This success was followed by the Discman for CDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>.

### Financial Services
In 1979, [[Sony]] diversified further by starting [[Sony Life]], a life insurance company, as a joint venture with Prudential in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>. This marked the beginning of [[Sony]]'s conglomerate structure. By 2014, [[Sony Financial Group]], which includes [[Sony Life]] and [[Sony Bank]], contributed 63% of [[Sony]]'s total operating profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.

### Acquisition of CBS Records and Columbia Pictures
In 1986, [[Sony]] acquired CBS Records for $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>. This acquisition was seen as strategically important for [[Sony]] to control content for its devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>. The deal proved to be financially successful, with [[Sony Music]] generating over $2 billion in operating cash flow annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>.

Building on this, [[Sony]] acquired Columbia Pictures in 1989 for $3.2 billion in equity (totaling $6 billion with assumed debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:39">[01:34:39]</a>. The motivation was partly a desire to gain leverage in the video industry after the Betamax defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:02">[01:35:02]</a>. However, this move created internal conflicts between hardware and content divisions, as device manufacturers aimed for open platforms while content owners desired exclusive channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:38">[01:35:38]</a>.

## The Gaming Revolution: PlayStation
In 1989, Ken Kutaragi, a senior engineer at [[Sony]], observed his daughter playing on a Famicom (Nintendo Entertainment System) and believed video games could be more than just toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>. He secretly connected with Nintendo and designed the sound chip for their successor system, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. Despite initial anger from [[Sony]] management, Norio Ohga protected Kutaragi's project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:35">[01:44:35]</a>.

Nintendo later approached [[Sony]] to develop a CD-ROM add-on for the SNES and a [[Sony]]-branded console combining the SNES with a CD drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:42">[01:45:42]</a>. At CES 1991, [[Sony]] announced the "Sony Nintendo PlayStation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:12">[01:47:12]</a>. However, the next day, Nintendo shockingly announced a partnership with Philips for CD gaming, betraying [[Sony]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>. This was because [[Sony]] was set to retain significant licensing rights for disc-based SNES games, which is where console manufacturers make most of their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:12">[01:49:12]</a>.

Despite the [[Challenging Times and Turnaround of Sony | Sony]] board voting to abandon the gaming project, Kutaragi, with Ohga's support, moved the project to [[Sony Music]] to protect it politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:28">[01:51:28]</a>. This led to the creation of the original PlayStation, which sold over 100 million units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:48">[01:54:48]</a>. [[Sony]] attracted third-party developers by using CDs (allowing more data), enabling PC-based game development, and offering a more developer-friendly approach than Nintendo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Over 8,000 unique games were released for the original PlayStation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:41">[01:56:41]</a>.

The PlayStation 2 became the most successful console of all time, selling over 150 million units worldwide, partly due to its built-in DVD player and backwards compatibility with PS1 games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:02">[01:57:02]</a>. However, the PlayStation 3 faced challenges due to its expensive Blu-ray drive and complex Cell processor, causing [[Sony]] to lose $5 billion in its first three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:42">[01:58:42]</a>.

## [[Challenging Times and Turnaround of Sony | Challenging Times and Turnaround of Sony]]
The early 2000s were difficult for [[Sony]]. In 2006, they lost their number one market share lead in televisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:46">[02:02:46]</a>. The television division bled cash for eight straight years and was restructured, with [[Sony]] largely exiting the business in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:21">[02:03:21]</a>. The Blu-ray format victory against HD DVD was a "pyrrhic victory" as streaming took off, diminishing the format's profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:55">[02:03:55]</a>.

[[Sony]]'s ventures into PCs (Vaio division, sold in 2014) and mobile/smartphones (Xperia line) were also unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:49">[02:11:49]</a>. This highlights a key challenge: [[Sony]] struggled when products became more like computers, lacking expertise in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:06">[02:13:06]</a>.

## [[Sonys Business and Market Strategy | Sony's Business and Market Strategy]] Today
Despite past struggles, [[Sony]] has executed a significant turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:42">[02:32:42]</a>. Today, [[Sony]] is a highly diversified conglomerate with no single-digit percentage business lines in revenue or profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:06">[02:21:06]</a>. Key segments include:
*   **Gaming**: Close to 30% of revenue and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:21">[02:19:21]</a>. Most sales come from digital software and add-ons rather than hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:46">[02:21:46]</a>. PlayStation dominates the console market, with three of the top three and four of the top six best-selling consoles of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>.
*   **Electronics Products and Solutions**: Account for 23% of revenue and 18% of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:23">[02:19:23]</a>.
*   **Imaging & Sensing Solutions**: 11% of revenue and 14% of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:12">[02:20:12]</a>. [[Sony]] holds about 50% market share in the image sensor market, being the sole supplier to iPhone for its camera sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:40">[02:16:40]</a>.
*   **Music**: Continues to be a strong segment, with [[Sony Music]] growing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:31">[02:31:31]</a>.
*   **Pictures**: [[Sony]] has pursued an "arms dealer" strategy in the streaming wars, licensing its content to multiple platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu, rather than vertically integrating with its own streaming service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The Spider-Man franchise, under a unique deal where [[Sony]] produces the main films (keeping 95% of revenue) while Marvel controls its integration into the MCU, has been a massive financial success for [[Sony]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>.

[[Sony's Business and Market Strategy | Sony's strategy]] today involves making the best hardware and being a component supplier or content licensor, rather than focusing on integrated software experiences or consumer gadget proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:40">[02:34:40]</a>. The [[company profiles like Nvidia Amazon and Sony | company]] remains important globally, being the second largest by market cap in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:12">[02:57:12]</a>.

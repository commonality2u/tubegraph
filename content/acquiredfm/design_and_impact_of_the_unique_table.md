The Benchmark office features a dining room on the 19th floor, a tradition initiated by Peter Fenton and Bill Gurley with the intent of injecting new practices and ideas into the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This concept was inspired by [[influences_from_benjamin_franklins_dinners | Benjamin Franklin]]'s biography, which described his weekly dinners focused on various subjects like finance, chemistry, and life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The first experimental dinner, held in late 2006 or 2007 with four [[guest_selection_and_significance_at_benchmark_dinners | outside guests]]—Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos—was described as "electric" and an "amazing" experience where "time stood still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Intent and Philosophy

The fundamental idea behind the dinners, and consequently the table, is that firms are driven by habits rather than merely strategies that might be disconnected from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Drawing from William James' philosophy, the belief is that human beings are an "amalgamation of our habits," which shape character and everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. To nurture curiosity, the firm's "essential lifeblood," a consistent habit was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. While Monday meetings attempt this, they are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The dinners, however, provide an "open-ended, no agenda, wild explorations" dynamic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. They foster "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved in one-on-one settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Table Design and Features

The design of the table itself was crucial in achieving this philosophy:
*   **Addressing Traditional Table Challenges** Rectangular tables embed power structures, while circular tables can atomize a group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The goal was to create a non-hierarchical construct that promoted intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Inspiration** The concept for the table came from "The Seven" by French designer Jean-Marie Masoud, which aimed for an organic form that could expand and collapse, most importantly to deconstruct power centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Custom Design** The specific table in the Benchmark office was designed by Ole Lundberg, based on a hand sketch provided by Peter Fenton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This unique design has even reportedly led to a "meaningful upgrade" in Lundberg's lifestyle due to other individuals with means desiring similar tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Shape and Functionality** The table's unique form, described as organic, prevents sidebar conversations because everyone can hear what is being said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This ensures "one conversation" at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Impact on Dynamics and Culture

The design of the table significantly shapes the firm's internal dynamics:
*   **Unified Conversation** The "one conversation" element is deemed powerful, ensuring that the entire group is "tuned in" to whatever is being discussed, whether it's good, bad, or tough news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This promotes a collective understanding and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Elimination of Pre-selling** In contrast to older venture capitalist practices where partners would have side conversations before a meeting to "pre-sell" an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, Benchmark's rule is "no pre-selling a deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This ensures that discussions are transparent and open to everyone at the table simultaneously.
*   **Embodiment of Firm Ethos** The table's structure reflects the firm's ethos of constant learning and activating curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, while also ensuring that all participants are equally engaged and informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Spotlight for Guests** The dinner setting places a "spotlight of attention" on the [[guest_selection_and_significance_at_benchmark_dinners | guests]], which is considered the greatest gift one can give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Esteemed individuals like Dylan Field (Figma CEO), Toby from Shopify, and Jeff Bezos have attended these dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. While the primary table is in San Francisco, Benchmark has held similar dinners in other locations like Los Angeles and Seattle, though the custom table is not portable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

At Benchmark, a core aspect of effective partnerships, both internally and with portfolio companies, revolves around [[importance_of_curiosity_and_collective_dialogue_in_venture_firms | vulnerability]] and openness. This approach fosters a culture of deep trust, truth-seeking, and genuine support, differentiating their model from traditional venture capital firms.

## Internal Partnership Dynamics

The firm's internal structure and practices are designed to promote transparency and discourage hierarchical power structures.

### The Benchmark Dinner and Monday Meetings
A key tradition is the Benchmark partner dinner, which has "No Agenda" [00:09:00] and allows for "wild explorations of the most bizarre things" [00:09:02]. These dinners aim for "social connection" that is "not transactional" [00:00:12], ensuring people leave "beaming smiling" [00:00:19]. This tradition, inspired by Ben Franklin's dinners [00:07:14], began as a "playful experiment" [00:07:32] to nurture curiosity, which is considered the "essential lifeblood of the firm" [00:08:42].

Monday partner meetings are structured to facilitate a "one conversation" [01:11:18] environment, where sidebars are impossible [01:11:17] and everyone is "tuned in" [01:11:49] to whatever is being discussed, whether it's good, tough, or bad news [01:11:42]. This open discussion is possible because there's "no next topic to jump to" [01:15:17], unlike firms working through a rigid list [01:15:18].

### Absence of Memos and Pre-Selling Deals
Benchmark partners do not write memos for deals, a practice that contrasts sharply with many other venture firms [01:12:12]. This is because memos can "force you into Clarity of thought but it also allows you to fill in blanks that the entrepreneur themselves are not saying" [01:14:07], potentially pushing "a sort of bias and perspective" [01:14:16] or manifesting "ego" [01:14:22].

Instead of pre-selling, partners relay discoveries "without the overarching bias" [01:14:47], purely stating "this is what I've discovered" [01:14:53]. This approach fosters "truth seeking" [01:13:12] where the primary goal is to determine if a company is "incredible" [01:13:18] and has the potential to be "one of these few extraordinary companies every decade" [01:13:25]. If that's the case, "you don't need to sell it" [01:13:43].

## External Partnerships with Founders

The same principles of openness and vulnerability extend to Benchmark's relationships with the founders they back.

### Commitment Over Bets
Benchmark views its investments as a "commitment" [00:33:52] rather than a "bet" [00:33:50]. This deeply committed approach means they are "on the field denting those odds" [00:34:06] alongside the founders. This leads to a level of support where partners "just care about every company that you work with and the founders and the teams" [00:34:36].

### Supporting Founders Through Challenges
A powerful example of this commitment occurred when a portfolio company faced a critical, emotionally charged decision over a weekend [00:29:23]. A Benchmark partner received a late-night call, and instead of getting "wrapped up in the emotion" [00:30:18], the partners zoomed out, recognizing their role is to "only recommend and guide entrepreneurs" [00:30:35]. The solution involved flying immediately to meet the founder in person, a gesture that conveyed a "level of support and commitment" [00:32:47] that changed the dynamic completely, leading to a positive outcome without the partner even having to say anything further [00:32:47].

This support extends to difficult situations, such as when a company "wrecked somewhere between two to three hundred million dollars of capital" [00:38:32], leading to a valuation drop to zero [00:39:00]. Despite other venture capitalists bailing [00:39:11], Benchmark partners maintained their commitment, with Peter expressing vulnerability to his partners about the mistakes made [00:39:41]. His partners responded by not only believing in the company but also reinvesting from a new fund [00:40:29].

### Balancing Fiduciary Responsibility and Founder Support
The traditional role of a General Partner involves a fiduciary responsibility to both Limited Partners (LPs) and the company itself [00:35:26]. Benchmark introduces a third, deeply important element: supporting and empowering the founder [00:35:49]. When these interests could potentially conflict, the key is vulnerability [00:36:44].

If a founder feels they "can't share this information" [00:36:55] with their Benchmark partner, the relationship is "degraded" [00:37:00]. This trust is paramount, and partners are willing to "fix" [00:37:02] it intimately through one-on-one conversations [00:37:05]. The firm prioritizes aligning with the "collective purpose" [00:37:10] of the company and the founder's vision [00:37:12], rather than external pressures from other firms or sector theses [00:37:46].

### No Growth Fund to Preserve Alignment
Benchmark's deliberate decision to not have a growth fund [00:41:57] reinforces this alignment. This ensures that the firm does not have a conflict of interest that would incentivize them to "put more money in at a better advantaged valuation for yourself" [00:56:38]. Instead, the goal is to "remove any chance of doubts or alternative incentives or questions in that relationship" [00:44:18], allowing the focus to remain solely on the company's success and helping founders "raise better rounds from better investors" [00:58:25] without internal competitive pressure.

## Seeking New Partnerships

The firm's approach to finding new partners is also rooted in vulnerability and shared experience, rather than formal processes or fixed criteria.

### Earning Trust and Respect
Prospective partners are often observed over time, building "really deep relationships" [01:30:06] by "serving on a board with the Benchmark partner" [01:30:04] and "go[ing] through hard shit together" [01:30:08]. This allows for a deeper understanding of how an individual operates under pressure, beyond superficial meetings [01:30:16]. The ultimate goal is to find individuals who embody the firm's values, especially an "underlying love of The Craft" [01:32:05] of venture capital and a total commitment to the work, doing it "even if I didn't get paid" [01:32:25].

### Generalists, Not Experts
Benchmark partners are inherently "generalists" [01:52:35] and "roving curious" [01:41:32] individuals, rather than rigid "thesis driven" [01:44:24] experts in specific sectors [01:44:26]. While the firm's portfolio may reflect current market trends (e.g., a tilt towards Enterprise [01:53:53]), the underlying "genotype" [01:53:57] remains generalist. This allows them to embrace areas of "high disruption" [01:41:19] like AI or crypto [01:40:05] without being constrained by prior specializations. The goal is to always be open to learning, as "every day people come in and talk to you about something their experts in" [01:45:15], providing opportunities to "learn something" [01:45:29] and "ask questions" [01:45:35].

Ultimately, Benchmark embraces the fact that they "don't know what we're doing" [01:47:11] in the sense of having a rigid playbook, instead prioritizing the ability to remain open and adapt to unique situations and individuals.

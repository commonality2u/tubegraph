Starbucks has achieved global scale, operating in over 80 countries with 39,000 stores worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a>. This international expansion was not without its challenges and unique strategies tailored to different markets.

## Initial International Strategy

Initially, Starbucks decided against expanding into Europe. Howard Schultz "wrote off Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a> because coffee was already established there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:33">[02:29:33]</a>, making it difficult for an American company to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:35">[02:29:35]</a>. This decision was compared to an American luxury leather goods company trying to compete with Herm√®s in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:55">[02:40:55]</a>. Instead, Starbucks prioritized markets where they perceived a greater opportunity.

## Expansion into Japan

Starbucks narrowed its focus to Japan, despite the board's initial resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:13">[02:30:13]</a>. The board questioned why they would expand internationally when there was still so much "white space in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:15">[02:30:15]</a>. An outside consultant reinforced this skepticism, concluding that Starbucks couldn't possibly succeed in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:41">[02:30:41]</a>, citing reasons such as:
*   The economics wouldn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:58">[02:30:58]</a>.
*   Japanese people would lose face by walking in the street with a cup of coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:04">[02:31:04]</a>.
*   Starbucks' no-smoking policy was a non-starter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:09">[02:31:09]</a>.
*   The rent economics were prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:14">[02:31:14]</a>.

However, a handwritten letter from a Japanese company, whose founder, Eugis son, was "enamored with Starbucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:47">[02:31:47]</a>, led to the formation of a joint venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The folklore suggests Japan was chosen as an international market because it had a direct flight to Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:12">[02:32:12]</a>.

The first store opened in Ginza, Tokyo, in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:24">[02:32:24]</a>, a hot and humid month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:26">[02:32:26]</a>. Despite concerns, 200 people were lined up for the opening, and the first customer ordered a "double tall latte" in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:22">[02:33:22]</a>. Japan was an "extraordinary success from minute one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:48">[02:33:48]</a>, largely due to the "iconic reputation and anticipation" of the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:05">[02:34:05]</a>. Within months, the Starbucks cup was "all over Tokyo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:25">[02:34:25]</a>. Today, Starbucks has 2,000 stores in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:51">[02:33:51]</a>.

## Entry into China

In 1999, Starbucks opened its first store in Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:53">[02:37:53]</a>. Starbucks initially lacked a clear understanding of the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:02">[02:38:02]</a> and started with a partner that proved unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:11">[02:38:11]</a>, as they didn't share Starbucks' values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:31">[02:38:31]</a>. Starbucks eventually bought out the partner and made the stores company-owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:38">[02:38:38]</a>.

The company struggled in China for almost a decade, losing money due to tremendous internal pressure to close operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:48">[02:38:48]</a>. China was a tea-drinking culture with no morning coffee business, and Starbucks initially "got real estate wrong" and "got breakfast wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:07">[02:16:07]</a> because decisions were controlled from Seattle by people who had never been to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:14">[02:16:14]</a>.

Belinda Wong, who had succeeded in Singapore and Hong Kong, became a pivotal figure in turning around the China business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>. She insisted on decentralizing control from Seattle, reporting directly to Howard Schultz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>. This allowed for local adaptation, such as designing menus with Chinese tastes in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:03">[02:17:03]</a>. Starbucks also demonstrated its commitment to humanity by working with the Chinese government and an insurance company to provide health insurance to the parents and grandparents of its partners, an unprecedented move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:12">[02:18:12]</a>. Today, China accounts for 18% of Starbucks' revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a>.

## Expansion into Italy

Starbucks chose to delay its entry into Italy for 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:16">[02:31:16]</a> out of respect for Italy's perfected coffee house concept and cultural relevance of espresso <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:26">[02:31:26]</a>. Howard Schultz knew "the knives would be out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:18">[02:32:18]</a> for Starbucks in Italy.

The entry was strategically timed with the opening of "The Roastery" concept. The Roastery is designed to be an immersive, theatrical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:11">[02:34:11]</a>, elevating the brand and fighting ubiquity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:53">[02:33:53]</a>. It is a creative project recalling "Willy Wonka" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:23">[02:33:23]</a>, featuring on-site coffee roasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:21">[02:34:21]</a>. Six Roasteries exist globally, including in Seattle, Chicago, New York, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Milan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:42">[02:32:42]</a>.

The Milan Roastery is considered the "shrine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:52">[02:34:52]</a> for Starbucks' entry into Italy. The ideal location in Milan, a former post office, was owned by Blackstone Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:18">[02:36:18]</a>, with whom Schultz directly negotiated a deal with John Gray, the firm's number two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:40">[02:36:40]</a>.

After opening the Roastery, Starbucks opened 30 traditional stores in Italy, in cities like Milan, Rome, and Florence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:06">[02:37:06]</a>. Starbucks has been "phenomenally well-received" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:34">[02:31:34]</a>, with straight espresso being the number one beverage in Italian Starbucks locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:32">[02:37:32]</a>, indicating that Italians, not just tourists, are choosing Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:54">[02:37:54]</a>. Schultz attributes this success partially to the perception that "coffee in Italy is not as good as it once was" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:49">[02:31:49]</a>, but primarily to the respect shown to Italian coffee culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:44">[02:37:44]</a>.

## Joint Venture and Licensing Models

Starbucks uses a variety of international growth strategies beyond direct ownership, particularly in non-English speaking markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:52">[02:17:52]</a>. These include:
*   **Joint Ventures (JVs):** Established with partners in the Middle East, Latin and Central America, Italy, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:24">[02:28:24]</a>. These can be 80/20, 50/50, or other structures depending on the country's economics and political issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:45">[02:28:45]</a>. In JVs, Starbucks is responsible for roasting coffee and recipes, while the partner controls operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:31">[02:29:31]</a>.
*   **Licensed Stores:** About half of Starbucks' 39,000 global stores are licensed or franchised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:58">[02:27:58]</a>. This includes master licenses for locations like airports and partnerships with retailers like Target, which operates 2,000 Starbucks stores within its locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:24">[02:30:24]</a>.
*   **No Traditional Franchising:** Howard Schultz stated that Starbucks intentionally avoided a traditional franchising model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:50">[02:12:50]</a> like McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:39">[02:13:39]</a>, believing it would dilute the company's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a>. This approach allowed Starbucks to maintain control over the customer experience and brand integrity.

These models demonstrate [[Capitalefficient growth strategies in technology companies|capital-efficient growth strategies]] by leveraging partners for local expertise and capital while retaining core control over the product and brand. However, managing diverse operational models across 80 countries creates significant [[Challenges and Strategies in the Global Payments Industry|complexity]] for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:12">[03:02:12]</a>.

Meta's approach to [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open source technology]] is a foundational element of its operations and strategic vision. The company views itself as a technology company focused on human connection, rather than just a social app company, which necessitates a strong underlying technological foundation that [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open source]] helps provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Historical Context and Benefits
Mark Zuckerberg acknowledges that Meta "wouldn't have been able to get built without [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open source]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Historically, Meta was the first major company to be built on the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. This reliance on [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open source]] allowed Meta to "develop stuff quickly and iterate quick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.

Meta's decision to embrace [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open source]] for its distributed computing infrastructure, such as with [[open_source_business_models_and_strategies | Open Compute]], was strategic. While Google, having built its infrastructure first, kept it proprietary for competitive advantage, Meta chose to make its equivalent systems [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This decision was based on the realization that it wouldn't provide a competitive edge against Google, but by making it [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open]], Meta could foster a community around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. This approach led to:
*   **Industry Standard:** [[open_source_business_models_and_strategies | Open Compute]] becoming an industry standard, with other cloud service platforms adopting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.
*   **Cost Savings:** Standardizing the supply chain around Meta's designs resulted in billions of dollars saved due to cheaper production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
*   **Improved Quality:** The quality of the technology Meta uses also increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

## Open Source in AI
Meta's [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open source]] philosophy extends to its [[open_source_ai | AI]] development, notably with models like LLaMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. Zuckerberg states that Meta is not an "[[open_source_business_models_and_strategies | open source]] zealot" and maintains a balance between [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open source]] and closed source projects, but believes [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open source]] is "very valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

Meta's position in the market makes an [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open]] approach to [[open_source_ai | AI]] sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. Having experienced restrictions on other platforms, Meta aims to build its own core technology platforms, including [[open_source_ai | AI]], to avoid full dependency on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. Ecosystems, including software, improve when more people use them, which aligns with Meta's philosophical stance and provides significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

## Competition and Future Platforms
Meta sees a competition between closed, integrated models (like Apple's) and [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open]] ecosystems (like Windows in the PC era) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>. Zuckerberg's goal for the next 10-15 years is to build and ensure that the next generation of [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open platforms]] wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>. He believes this will lead to a more vibrant tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. This ideological competition extends to platforms like [[open_source_ai | LLaMA]] in [[open_source_ai | AI]] and glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>. The aim is for developers, even individuals starting in a dorm room, not to require permission to build the next "awesome things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>.

## Self-Sufficiency and Long-Term Vision
Meta's strategy, particularly with its investments in [[metas_approach_to_the_metaverse_and_its_implications | Reality Labs]] and [[metas_approach_to_ai_and_ar_development | AI infrastructure]], is driven by a desire to control its own destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. This includes avoiding the "taxes" and restrictions imposed by other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. Zuckerberg estimates that Meta could be twice as profitable if it owned its own platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>. This long-term view, even through [[challenges_and_strategies_for_amazon_tsmc_and_meta | painful periods]] and short-term investor skepticism, is a core part of Meta's identity and its commitment to building the future of human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

Zuckerberg believes that the company "put[s] a flag down around what we're doing and we're going to go do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. This commitment to a clear vision and mission, even in the face of obstacles, defines Meta's approach to [[technological_innovation_and_challenges_at_meta | innovation]] and its strategic embrace of [[open_source_technologys_role_at_meta | open source]] principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

Slack's journey as a public company was significantly shaped by its intense competition with [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft Teams]], a dynamic that profoundly influenced its market perception and eventual acquisition by [[salesforces_strategy_and_vision_for_slack | Salesforce]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## The Bear Case and Microsoft's Influence
The primary reason for Slack's valuation being "beaten down" was the perceived threat of [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft Teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft]] actively targeted Slack by name, publicly stating they were "crushing Slack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. They even unusually put Slack's name directly on charts comparing user numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This aggressive stance highlighted [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft's]] view that Slack posed a direct threat to core products like Outlook if Slack were to displace email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

While Slack reported strong numbers—growing at 49% year-over-year, being the fifth fastest-growing company, and having the second-best net dollar retention among leading SaaS firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>—the market often viewed these unfavorably when compared to the explosive growth of companies like Zoom, which was growing at 300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This created a persistent bearish narrative around Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## User Base and Product Architecture Differences
A key point of contention was the comparison of user counts. [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft Teams]] has approximately 10 times the number of users as Slack, crossing the 100 million user mark recently, while Slack is in the 12 million range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

However, this comparison is often misleading:
*   **Distribution Advantage:** [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft]] is phenomenal at distribution, often pre-installing or automatically launching Teams on PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Their reported "active user" counts are potentially inflated, a long-standing practice seen previously with Azure and Office 365 numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft Teams]] is designed to be the hub for all things [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft]] within an organization, especially as a video conferencing tool during remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Slack, conversely, is built for deeper organizational chat and integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   **Platform Threat:** Slack's threat to [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft]] is its potential to become a hub for an "office suite comprised of best-in-class software" that integrates with tools like G Suite and Figma, potentially displacing Outlook and other core [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft]] Office products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Zoom, by contrast, is primarily a video product and not a platform threat to [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft's]] cash cow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

[[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft's]] strategy, reminiscent of [[microsofts_strategy_during_the_ballmer_years | the Ballmer years]], leverages its dominant distribution channel for enterprise software, especially through email, Word, and Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. They have heavily invested in Teams, rolling in Skype and consolidating other internal communication tools under its umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

## Slack's Strategy Against Microsoft
Slack's growth playbook involved initially acquiring small, innovative organizations and growing with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. The challenge was penetrating larger enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

### Slack Connect
A major strategic focus for Slack has been "Slack Connect," which facilitates communication channels between different companies and clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. This feature grew significantly, from 380,000 to 520,000 "endpoints" in one quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>, and is seen as a way to expand beyond internal communication to "kill email" for external interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

Slack Connect acts as a "try before you buy" mechanism, allowing potential clients to experience Slack's product quality through shared channels, encouraging broader adoption within their own organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.

### Product Positioning Challenges
Despite its strong underlying metrics, Slack faced challenges in clearly communicating its value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. Its marketing message changed several times, from "where work happens" to being a "virtual office" or an "email killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. This lack of a consistent, concise, and resonating message made it difficult for the market to fully grasp its long-term potential, especially against [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft's]] aggressive narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>.

## The Broader "Anti-Microsoft Alliance" and the [[future_of_collaboration_tools_in_enterprise | Future of Collaboration Tools]]
The acquisition of Slack by [[salesforces_strategy_and_vision_for_slack | Salesforce]] can be viewed as the emergence of an "anti-Microsoft" consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. It represents a move towards consolidating "best-of-breed" applications (e.g., Slack, Box, Dropbox) under one umbrella, offering an alternative to [[microsofts_challenges_and_adaptations_in_the_mobile_and_consumer_technology_sectors | Microsoft's]] integrated but arguably less specialized suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Microsoft's approach: "Microsoft is the full integrated system that's best at nothing but they're the best integrated." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>

However, Slack also faces a long-term "bear case" from the evolution of collaboration itself:
*   **Embedded Chat:** Many modern workflow applications (e.g., Figma, Notion) are building chat and collaboration directly into their platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. If chat becomes embedded directly within the apps where work happens, Slack could become a secondary tool for general announcements or emergencies, much like email is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.
*   **Next-Generation Tools:** New tools like Discord (though not enterprise-focused) or emerging "HQ-like" remote work products are building native collaboration experiences that might be better suited for the future of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.

The challenge for Slack, and now [[salesforces_strategy_and_vision_for_slack | Salesforce]], is to either compete with embedded chat by offering its API for in-app chat integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a> or to define its role as the central hub for distributed workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. The acquisition by [[salesforces_strategy_and_vision_for_slack | Salesforce]] may boost its enterprise adoption but could simultaneously "loosen conviction" among startups if it's perceived as losing its independent, agile appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:36">[01:20:36]</a>.

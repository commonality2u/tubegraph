## Meta's Current State and Challenges

[[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] has been a significant focus of analysis, with Ben Thompson noting it as one of his "long-standing best calls" alongside Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>. Despite initial market perceptions, Thompson has consistently argued that [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] (then Facebook) was "way more dominant and valuable than anyone thinks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>.

However, [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] faces significant challenges. The Apple privacy changes were "very devastating" and "structurally devastating," warranting a "significant haircut on their valuation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:12">[01:34:12]</a>. While these changes were "moat enhancing in the long run" by questioning if any other company could build a competitive top-of-the-funnel advertising product, [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]]'s continued success relies on retaining its audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a>.

A primary concern for [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] is its transition from a constantly growing company to one needing a "scarcity mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:44">[01:34:44]</a>. The company laid off 11,000 people, a move that only brings them "back like nine months" and is "very destructive to company culture and morale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:48">[01:34:48]</a>. Despite this, all of [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]]'s products are still growing, which Thompson believes is "underappreciated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:11">[01:35:11]</a>.

## The Metaverse Investment and its Critique

From a strategic standpoint, Thompson believes [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] is "broadly on the right track" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:15">[01:35:15]</a>. However, he considers the metaverse investment a "bad idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>. His criticisms include:

*   **Resource Drain**: It is consuming "so many resources and attention" from [[mark_zuckerbergs_vision_for_the_future_of_meta | Mark Zuckerberg]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:46">[01:35:46]</a>.
*   **Innovation Model**: Thompson doubts that "innovation is necessarily born of mass expenditures in large companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>. Instead of an ecosystem built through "experimentation" and "consolidation," [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] is attempting to "Brute Force this sort of bit" with a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:58">[01:35:58]</a>.
*   **Company Identity**: [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook]] is primarily a "Services Company" and a "social network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. Their metaverse strategy "works against that" core identity, as they need to sell headsets at a sufficient scale within existing friend networks to enable social networking on the devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>.
*   **Distance to Success**: [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]]'s "place of winning is even further away than I think people think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:25">[01:36:25]</a>. Thompson has been "anti them doing [the metaverse] from day one," including the acquisition of Oculus, which he previously deemed a "bad" decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>.

## Advertising and Niche Businesses

Thompson believes the market is "overly down on [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]]" partly because its branding was "too successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:47">[01:36:47]</a>. He maintains that [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] is "still a Powerhouse in social media and advertising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>, and the money they spend on the metaverse is "not that much" in the grand scheme, considering their five-billion-dollar quarterly profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:55">[01:36:55]</a>.

He advocates for [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] to "double down on what they are and consolidate that" by acquiring Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>. This move would "close the loop on e-commerce and advertising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:25">[01:37:25]</a>, despite potential antitrust challenges from the FTC, which he suggests they should "throw it to court" and fight for three years due to the potential payoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>.

Thompson is generally favorable towards [[metas_strategies_and_future_outlook | Meta]] because of its role as an "essential component in the broader ecosystem of Niche businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. He notes that [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook]] advertising has always been the best at helping these niche businesses advertise, which is crucial in a world where the internet enables new economic opportunities for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>. He highlights that while some content spreads organically (like his own through discussions on Twitter), other products, such as clothing, need advertising, a space where [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook]] excels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>.

### Historical Context

It's noted that the [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook]] IPO was initially a "disaster" in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>, and many believed [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook]] was "doomed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>. However, Thompson's early analysis suggested the company's dominance and value were "underestimated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>. The shift in market understanding regarding the internet's centralizing nature, rather than decentralizing, also supported [[history_of_meta_and_facebook | Facebook]]'s trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:29">[01:23:29]</a>.

Ultimately, Thompson's stance is to "double down on what they are" and focus on consolidating their strong position in social media and advertising, rather than extensive, speculative investments in areas like the metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>.

The "American Dynamism" thesis, led by Katherine Boyle, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, focuses on companies that support the national interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:07">[08:05:07]</a>. This includes traditional industrial sectors like aerospace and defense, which have supported government since the mid-20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>, but also encompasses crucial sectors affecting every citizen such as education, housing, transportation, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

The premise is that while there has been significant [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_venture_capital_and_startups | technological innovation]] over the past 30 years, software has largely not impacted these physical spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Many large and important companies, such as SpaceX, fall into this category outside of traditional consumer or enterprise technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. These companies often sell to, compete with, or are heavily regulated by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

## Why the American Dynamism Thesis Now?

The [[venture_capital_strategies_and_the_importance_of_optimism | American Dynamism thesis]] is considered particularly timely due to several tailwinds, especially coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

### The "Time to Build" Impetus
The thesis largely originates from Mark Andreessen's "Time to Build" blog post, which highlighted a fundamental shift in the world post-COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. There's a belief that the world fundamentally changed with COVID, with impacts that will be felt for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

### Shifting Talent and Entrepreneurial Spirit
Historically, Silicon Valley has excelled at consumer and efficiency-focused businesses but has largely avoided direct engagement with government, viewing procurement as nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. However, there's a growing founder appetite for innovating on 21st-century models, particularly in education, which still largely operates on a 19th-century model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

*   **Emergence of Non-Traditional Founders:** The talent landscape has changed, with people from diverse backgrounds, like former teachers or Department of Defense procurement officers, becoming founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>. This contrasts with the traditional profile of computer science majors or engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>.
*   **"The Social Network" Effect:** The movie *The Social Network* (released around 2011) inadvertently spurred a generation of young people to embrace the idea of being a founder, shifting technology from a counter-culture to a mainstream aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>. Young, ambitious individuals who previously might have sought careers in government or traditional jobs now opt to build companies, seeking to solve problems and have an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.
*   **Government's Need for Private Sector Tech:** Governments, particularly the Department of Defense, are realizing they need to partner more deeply with the private sector for software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. While individuals in government use modern consumer apps in their private lives (Uber, DoorDash), their professional tools often lag decades behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>. The best software builders are not entering government, necessitating external solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction in Startup Formation:** The cost of starting a startup has drastically decreased due to the availability of external tools and services, meaning founders no longer need to build everything from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>. Government, however, remains a "last holdout" in building internally, often using taxpayer dollars to develop expensive, inefficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>.

### Democratization of Tech and Decentralization
The post-COVID era has shown that companies can be built from anywhere, not just traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley or New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:38:00">[52:38:00]</a>. This "exporting of Silicon Valley" is an extraordinary development, combating the historical "brain drain" from other states to tech centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:47:00">[52:47:00]</a>. The remote work movement is expected to spur numerous great companies in "second and third cities" and even smaller towns across America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_dynamics_of_venture_capital | Challenges and Dynamics of Venture Capital]] in American Dynamism

Investing in the "physical world" or sectors like defense has historically been seen as difficult for [[venture_capital_models_and_partnerships | venture capital]] because these are not "pure software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   **Entrenched Interests and Regulation:** These sectors are often old, heavily regulated, and dominated by large, entrenched players, making innovation challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.
*   **Longer J-Curve:** Companies in this space are "harder to build" and often go "deeper down the j-curve" of initial losses before seeing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. SpaceX serves as a prime example, facing years of worry about investor returns and technical risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   **Capital and Talent Requirements:** These companies may require more upfront capital and longer periods of private or venture-backed existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. However, they often become holding companies more quickly and attract finite specialized talent, leading to less competition compared to consumer or enterprise tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

## Examples of American Dynamism Companies

*   **Flock Safety:** A Y Combinator company based in Atlanta, founded by Garrett Langley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>. It developed small, cost-effective license plate reader cameras to help eliminate crime, focusing on tracking cars rather than people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:20:00">[54:20:00]</a>. Initially sold to homeowners' associations, its success in solving crimes led police chiefs nationwide to adopt their technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:44:00">[54:44:00]</a>. Flock Safety now operates in 30 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:03:00">[55:03:00]</a>.
*   **Hadrian:** This Los Angeles-based company builds automated machine shops for aerospace and defense manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:08:00">[59:08:00]</a>. Founder Chris Power, an Australian immigrant, realized the existing machine shop industry was aging and inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:41:00">[59:41:00]</a>. He opted to build new, automated facilities from scratch and upskill American workers, rather than attempting to retrofit old ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Hadrian serves new space sector companies and larger aerospace and defense clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

## The Cultural Shift: Abundance vs. Scarcity

[[Venture Capital Dynamics | Silicon Valley's culture]] is fundamentally one of abundance, where incentives are aligned for growth and creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. In contrast, Washington D.C. operates on a "scarcity" mindset, where power is scarce and hierarchical, and success is often zero-sum, particularly within short political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

*   **Defining Success:** In Silicon Valley, the currency is equity, success, and building bigger businesses faster, with an understanding that multiple winners can exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. [[Venture Capital Partnership Dynamics | Venture capital]] creates new things from nothing, generating jobs and solving new problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This contrasts with private equity, often seen as consolidating old companies and cutting jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Pride in Creation:** There's a strong culture of pride in building and earning, especially in places like Miami, with its large foreign-born population, where capitalism is celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This contrasts with a perceived shame of success in some parts of Silicon Valley or Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The American Dynamism thesis aims to catalyze a "renaissance" where people work together across diverse skill sets, much like the innovation seen in Silicon Valley in the 1940s and 50s with the Department of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This includes upskilling a new generation of machinists who can collaborate with aerospace engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

This movement represents a "small business revolution" on the internet, enabling individual creators and founders to build new types of businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. While "Big Tech" often draws criticism, "small tech" companies are working to solve the country's big problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. The decentralization of talent, allowing founders to build from anywhere, is viewed as highly beneficial for the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

It is hoped that within the next decade, "American Dynamism" will become a standard investment category for every [[Venture Capital Models and Partnerships | venture capital]] firm, akin to enterprise or consumer tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This is not seen as impact investing or ESG, but as the future source of American innovation and a prime area for top [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture firms]] to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. As [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_venture_capital_and_startups | technology permeates]] all aspects of the world, even sectors without high gross margins can yield massive businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

> "America is the greatest experiment in human history. The vast majority of Americans come from somewhere else... The founders experience in this country looks a lot like what the founders did in this country where it is just like a rejection of everything they have known to build something new." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>

The American experience is fundamentally about misfits and contrarians coming to escape and build something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The goal is to see this incentive alignment and innovation spread across the country, not just remain a unique phenomenon in Northern California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

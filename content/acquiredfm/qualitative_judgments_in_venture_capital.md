Investing in private markets, particularly early-stage private market investing like [[Venture capital and investing strategies | venture capital]], relies heavily on qualitative judgments about the future, rather than solely on readily available current quantitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This approach is distinct from public market investing, which often involves extensive analysis of existing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Role of Qualitative Judgment

For some investors, [[qualitative_judgment_and_human_insight_in_investing | qualitative judgments]] about the future are a better fit for their skill set than traditional public market analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. In [[Venture capital dynamics and firm structure | venture capital]], a significant part of the process involves identifying substantial disparities between a company's current valuation and its potential future worth if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

This necessitates:
*   **Imagining the Future** Investors must envision what a business could look like ten years down the line if it achieves success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This requires a focus on potential and long-term vision, moving beyond current data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Visualization** It's helpful to visualize the future financials and "moats" (competitive advantages) of the business, even if it's currently nascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This includes considering the capital required to reach that future state, the likelihood of competition, and how the company might evolve after establishing itself in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Optimism and Futurism** An investor suited for [[Venture capital as a probabilistic endeavor | venture capital]] needs to be an optimist and a futurist, focusing on "what could this be if it works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This contrasts with investment strategies focused on finding undervalued assets or predicting a slow decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Knowledge Advantage

In markets where current company data is widely accessible, gaining a knowledge advantage requires a different approach than simply massaging existing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The key lies in being superior at making [[qualitative_judgment_and_human_insight_in_investing | qualitative judgments]] about what the future holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This represents an evolution from traditional "value investing" principles, such as "buying dollars for 50 cents," towards dealing with the challenging aspects of qualitative and future-oriented analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Contrasting Investment Styles

The nature of [[Venture capital as a probabilistic endeavor | venture capital]] is different from investment strategies focused on avoiding permanent capital loss, a core principle in some traditional investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. For some investors, a portfolio where returns are tightly clustered around an average (e.g., all companies returning roughly 20%) may not align with their skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Instead, the focus is on finding "extremely high expected value investments" where, on average, money might be lost on individual occurrences, but a portfolio of such bets yields a great return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

> "I also don't think that I would be particularly great at that. I mean if you told me I had to have an, you know, a portfolio of of 10 companies where, uh, not only would they the portfolio return be 20 but they'd all be roughly 20 or they'd go somewhere between 10 and 30 or something like that, I mean I just don't know if that would be as suited with my skill set." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

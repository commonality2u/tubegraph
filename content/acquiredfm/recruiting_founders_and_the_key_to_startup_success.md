## Aligning Strategy with Demeanor and Strengths

A fundamental principle for success, whether in investment or career, is to ensure one's strategy aligns with their demeanor and natural strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Pursuing what comes naturally leads to greater enjoyment, competitive advantage, and durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. When offering career advice, the recommendation is to seek opportunities that leverage strengths, avoid weaknesses, and are enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Choosing a path solely for money without enjoyment is considered a "world-class mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

However, it's equally important not to become too confined by one's comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. An example is [[Warren Buffett]], who largely ignored technology, failing to recognize that many tech companies operate with "moats" similar to non-technology businesses, which he typically understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While sticking to one's "last" is crucial, so is being open-minded and adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### The Paradox of Investing

Investing presents a conundrum where seemingly contradictory traits are necessary for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>:
*   **Confidence vs. Humility:** Investors must be confident enough to back uncertain ventures and stay with them, even buying more when they decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Yet, this confidence must not devolve into pig-headedness, leading to continued bad decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Concentration vs. Diversification:** Holdings need to be concentrated enough for good ideas to make a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, but also diversified to guard against unforeseen risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

These complexities highlight that success in fields like investing cannot be reduced to a simple algorithm; human judgment is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## The Essence of Judgment

Ultimately, everything comes down to judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. As [[Charlie Munger]] once noted, "None of this is meant to be easy. Anybody thinks it's easy is stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The tasks involved in investing are simple to describe but difficult to execute consistently and better than others over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Superior judgment often stems from "second-level thinking" – thinking at a higher level than others, not just differently, but more correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This intangible quality encompasses perception, knowledge advantage, insight, and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. While difficult to teach directly, like coaching height in basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, judgment likely arises from:
*   **Deep knowledge:** A thorough understanding of what matters and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Rationality:** The ability to think logically rather than emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Self-awareness:** Understanding one's own biases that might influence decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Intellectual humility:** Recognizing the possibility of being wrong and knowing the limits of one's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Computers currently cannot evaluate business plans to identify the next [[Amazon]] or recognize the next [[Steve Jobs]], emphasizing the enduring value of human qualitative judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Evaluating Judgment and Recruiting Exceptional Founders

In roles requiring the evaluation of others' judgment, such as recruiting, it's essential to look for "smart eyes" – exceptional people who intuitively grasp important concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. They go beyond readily available quantitative data and understand underlying dynamics, like the intuitive understanding that "the cure for low oil prices is low oil prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

Beyond intellect, **teamwork** is crucial. Desirable individuals are team players who can effectively exchange ideas and incorporate input from peers, superiors, and subordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Lone wolves or "eat what you kill" types are generally not desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### The Founder as the Key in Venture Capital

In venture capital, a significant portion of the investment decision-making revolves around understanding and assessing [[founders_insights_and_mentorship_at_y_combinator | Founders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The firm belief is that the "vast, vast majority of the investment consideration is backing the right people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

To evaluate a founder's judgment, it's more effective to delve into their past decisions and background rather than relying on prepared statements about future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This process involves:
*   Understanding *why* they made past decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   Assessing if they've learned and evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   Determining if their decisions were based on first principles and a willingness to go against the herd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   Confirming their ideas stem from specific knowledge of a real problem and deep understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

Recruiting also benefits from understanding what candidates have done and why, alongside testing for specific skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### The Need for Unconventional Founders

For startups, which lack a clear roadmap and often involve doing things for the first time or uniquely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, founders need to be "weirdos" or unconventional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. They must possess "real conviction in yourself" and be willing to operate based on their own views rather than conventional approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. As a key memo suggests, "the path to exceptionality cannot come through doing what everybody else does" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

Being "uncomfortably idiosyncratic" is essential to outperform competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Even with an outstanding idea like [[Google]]'s PageRank algorithm, a mediocre or even talented conventional person would likely fail to build a successful company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This is because building a company is inherently difficult, and success attracts intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Exceptional [[founders_insights_and_mentorship_at_y_combinator | Founders]] are required to exhibit exceptional judgment, attract and retain other exceptional people, and ultimately out-compete rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

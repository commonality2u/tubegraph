[[the_impact_of_market_evolution_on_investing | Learning and evolution]] are considered really important in the investment field, both for firms and individuals [00:01:09]. It involves continuously trying to expand competencies and acknowledging mistakes [00:01:17].

## Balancing Personal Demeanor and Open-Mindedness

An [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investment strategy]] should suit an investor's demeanor [00:00:03]. It's advisable to find something that utilizes one's strengths, avoids weaknesses, and is enjoyable [00:00:34]. Pursuing an activity that is natural offers competitive advantage and durability [00:00:18]. Sacrificing enjoyment solely for greater financial gain is considered a "world-class mistake" [00:01:00].

However, investors cannot remain too fixed within their comfort zone [00:01:26]. There's a dichotomy in investing: while it's important to stick to what one is good at, it's also essential to be open-minded and willing to change [00:02:43].

A critique of figures like Warren Buffett is that he "totally ignored technology," which became pervasive [00:01:40]. Although Buffett is highly intelligent and understands many business elements, he might have viewed technology as "science projects" where technical advantage is the sole driver [00:01:48]. However, many technology companies succeed due to "moats" similar to non-technology businesses, which Buffett could have understood if it were within his comfort zone [00:02:09].

## The Role of Judgment

The field of investing is complex and cannot be reduced to an algorithm [00:03:41]. Humanity plays a role in making better qualitative judgments about the future [00:03:46]. Ultimately, everything in investing comes down to judgment [00:05:01].

It's a "simple but not easy" endeavor to perform consistently better than others over time [00:05:38].

### Components of Superior Judgment

Superior judgment, often referred to as "second-level thinking," involves thinking at a higher, more correct level than others [00:06:01]. It means diverging from consensus thinking, but doing so correctly [00:06:09]. This intangible quality encompasses perception, knowledge advantage, insight, and context [00:06:22].

Key elements contributing to judgment include:
*   **Deep knowledge and understanding** of the framework for what truly matters [00:06:51].
*   **Rationality**: The ability to think logically rather than emotionally [00:06:59].
*   **Self-awareness**: Knowing one's own biases that might affect decision-making [00:07:07].
*   **Intellectual humility**: Acknowledging the possibility of being wrong, knowing what one doesn't know, and seeking input from others [00:07:16].

### Evaluating Judgment in Others

When recruiting, evaluating judgment involves looking for "smart eyes" â€“ exceptional people who grasp things better than others [00:08:04]. These individuals understand what is important, can go beyond quantitative information, and intuitively understand market dynamics (e.g., "the cure for low oil prices is low oil prices") [00:08:16]. Team players who can exchange ideas and incorporate input from peers, managers, and subordinates are preferred over "lone wolves" [00:08:37]. Compensation should not solely be based on individual quantitative performance [00:09:03].

In venture capital, a significant part of the [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | investment decision-making]] revolves around understanding and backing the right founders [00:09:14]. Evaluating founders' judgment involves:
*   Spending time understanding their story and background [00:09:55].
*   Analyzing *why* they made past decisions [00:10:05]. It's difficult to fake past actions, unlike prospective answers [00:10:29].
*   Determining if they've made decisions based on their own judgment, learned and [[the_impact_of_market_evolution_on_investing | evolved]], acted on first principles, and were willing to go against the herd [00:10:36].
*   Assessing if their ideas stem from specific knowledge of a real problem and deep understanding [00:10:49].

Great founders are often "weirdos" or "unconventional," demonstrating traits that are "four standard deviations from the mean" in some crucial area [00:11:36]. They must think for themselves, have real conviction, and be willing to do things based on their own views rather than simply excelling at conventional approaches [00:12:22].

## The Need for Unconventionality

Success, particularly in startups where there isn't a clear roadmap [00:12:10], often requires doing things differently [00:12:46]. The path to exceptionality cannot come from merely doing what everyone else does [00:12:52]. In fields where there is no simple algorithm for consistent success, the person who "sees differently and better" will win [00:13:07].

David Swensen, who managed Yale's endowment, emphasized the need to do things that are "uncomfortably idiosyncratic" to achieve an edge [00:13:24]. While this may involve being "out of step with so-called common sense," it is necessary to succeed [00:13:37].

Consider the idea of providing a mediocre, conventionally talented person with a groundbreaking concept like Google's PageRank algorithm [00:13:55]. The likelihood of that person building Google is "zero" [00:14:11]. This is because:
1.  Building a company, even with a great idea, is incredibly difficult and requires exceptional execution [00:14:18].
2.  Success attracts competition, necessitating the ability to out-compete others [00:14:24].

It takes exceptional people who can exhibit [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | exceptional judgment]] and attract and retain other exceptional individuals to build successful ventures [00:14:37]. This goes beyond mere [[the_role_of_luck_in_investment_success | luck]] and points to [[investment_strategies_resilience_and_optionality | skill]] [00:04:45].

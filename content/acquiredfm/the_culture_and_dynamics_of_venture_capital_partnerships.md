From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The venture capital (VC) landscape is characterized by its dynamic and often intensely personal nature, especially within the partnerships that drive investment firms. The firm [[benchmark_venture_capital_firms_structure_and_strategy | Benchmark]] stands out as a unique case study in the [[the_role_of_venture_capital_and_its_challenges | venture capital]] industry, fundamentally shaped by its adherence to an "equal partnership" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. Unlike many of its peers, Benchmark has famously asserted that [[venture_capital_strategies_and_firm_architecture | venture capital doesn't scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>, choosing not to grow its fund size, employ junior partners, or develop a platform team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>. This deliberate counter-positioning has profoundly influenced its [[venture_capital_strategies_and_firm_architecture | firm architecture]] and its approach to [[venture_capital_investment_strategies | investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:28">[01:38:28]</a>.

## The Genesis of an Equal Partnership Model

In the early 1990s, the venture capital ecosystem in Silicon Valley was dominated by powerful individual figures like John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Kleiner Perkins operated with a "guy" model, where John Doerr was the undisputed leader and top performer, often aggressively pursuing deals and then attempting to pass off board seats to junior partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. This firm also adopted a "modern Keiretsu" approach, facilitating (and sometimes forcing) partnerships and business development relationships among its portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a>.

This established structure, where management companies were owned and controlled by founders with little equity for junior partners, led to significant resentment among younger venture capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. Robert Kagle, then a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI), passionately believed that anything other than an equal partnership was morally wrong for a VC firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Kagle, who came from a humble background in Flint, Michigan, and was the first in his family to attend college (General Motors University) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>, sought to establish a new model.

When Kagle's firm, TVI (notable for its early investment in Microsoft) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>, decided to "declare victory" and cease operations due to internal disagreements over economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a>, Kagle approached Bruce Dunleavy of Merrill Pickard, Anderson & Eyre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Despite Dunleavy having interned for Kagle, Kagle offered him an equal partnership, demonstrating an "obsessive sense of fairness" and "absurd amount of self-confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

### Formation of Benchmark

The initial recruitment faced skepticism from other young GPs in the valley, who viewed the idea as "nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. However, Kagle and Dunleavy, along with Andy Ratcliffe (also from Merrill Pickard) and Kevin Harvey (an entrepreneur) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>, eventually formed the core of Benchmark Capital in late 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. They ambitiously named the firm "Benchmark Capital," signaling an aspiration to "set a new Benchmark for performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.

Their audacious prospectus demanded 30% carry (profit share) compared to the industry standard of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. This premium carry, for an unproven firm, was "quite laughable" to some LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Stanford University, for example, not only declined to invest but actively organized against Benchmark, temporarily blackballing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. Despite this, firms like Horsley Bridge made a significant bet, and Benchmark Fund One (an $85 million fund) became one of the best-performing venture funds in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.

The founders embraced "Built to Last" by Jim Collins, even handing copies to prospective LPs, symbolizing their commitment to longevity despite being a new firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

## Evolution and Challenges of the Partnership

The early years of Benchmark were not without internal struggles. After a "letdown" period in 1995-1996, the fifth founding partner, Val Vaden, whose buyout investment style didn't align with the firm's focus on formation-stage tech investments, departed amicably at the end of 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

### Rekindling "Swagger" and the eBay Win

The remaining four partners (Kagle, Dunleavy, Ratcliffe, Harvey) decided to recruit a new fifth partner to "re-inject that DNA" of competitiveness and "swagger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. They brought in David Beirne, a leading executive recruiter, known for his relentless drive and ability to "will his way to the top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. Beirne's first major deal was Webvan, a seemingly audacious bet to build an "online Walmart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. Although Webvan is now a cautionary tale of the dot-com era, Benchmark's $3.5 million investment, alongside Sequoia, was a "great risk-adjusted bet" at the time, briefly soaring to an $800 million public valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

The firm's defining moment came with its investment in eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. Despite eBay having "hair on it" (e.g., founder Pierre Omidyar still working full-time at General Magic, basic website design) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a> and other VCs passing, Benchmark's entire partnership championed the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a>. They invested $6.7 million at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. They also reportedly provided equity-backed loans to Omidyar and Jeff Skoll, allowing them to take some money off the table and resist a $50 million acquisition offer from Knight Ridder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. This "highly untraditional" approach, later seen in deals like Clubhouse, demonstrated their willingness to break norms to secure great companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>.

By September 1998, eBay IPO'd, and Benchmark's stake was worth $400 million, soaring to over $4 billion by spring 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>. This meant a staggering $1.5 billion in carry for the partners, demonstrating the immense payoff of their equal partnership and premium carry model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>.

### The Imperial Era and Its Contradictions

Post-eBay, Benchmark faced new challenges. Having achieved "highest performing Venture fund of all time" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>, partners had made hundreds of millions, raising the question: "Why are we raising from LPs again?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>. They were also overwhelmed with opportunitiesâ€”from "dot-comification" joint ventures with Fortune 500 companies (like Nordstrom, Toys R Us, Goldman Sachs, GM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a> to a desire to expand internationally.

Contrary to its current lean image, Benchmark "tried everything" during this "Imperial Era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:07">[02:00:07]</a>. They raised a $1 billion fund (Fund Four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">[02:17:59]</a>, expanded to Europe (Balderton Capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:34">[02:30:34]</a> and Israel (Ofer Investments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:38">[02:30:38]</a>, and even formed a "corporate network" of industry executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>. The one thing they consistently avoided was bringing in junior partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>, a decision hard to undo.

This period, from roughly 2001-2010, saw Benchmark miss major opportunities like Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>, Skype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:56">[02:24:56]</a>, and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:36">[02:25:36]</a>, often due to internal conflicts, handing off deals, or existing portfolio conflicts (e.g., Friendster for Facebook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:13">[02:26:13]</a>. These "sins of omission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a> highlighted the pitfalls of over-extension and losing focus. The question "Is it still The Benchmark to bet on?" began to circulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:55">[02:28:55]</a>.

### The Refounding: The Fab Four Era

Around 2004-2005, the partners decided to re-center the firm, spinning off their international operations and returning to their core focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:26">[02:30:26]</a>. This marked a crucial generational transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:02">[02:31:02]</a>. Original partners David Beirne and Andy Ratcliffe stepped back without taking "tail economics" (carry in new funds), living up to the equal partnership principles they had advocated for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:55">[02:31:55]</a>.

The "Fab Four" era began with the recruitment of Peter Fenton (from Accel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:14">[02:34:14]</a>, Mitch Lasky (an entrepreneur and games industry veteran) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:09">[02:39:09]</a>, and Matt Cohler (employee #5 at Facebook and early LinkedIn employee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:17">[02:41:17]</a>. These new partners, alongside Bill Gurley (who joined in 1999, known for his analytical "Above the Crowd" writings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:21">[02:05:21]</a>, created a "most impressive lineup of venture capitalists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:05">[02:33:05]</a>.

The "Fab Four" brought a new dynamic:
*   **Bill Gurley:** Became known for his analytical approach to marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:10">[02:14:10]</a>, investing in companies like OpenTable, Zillow, and GrubHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:12">[02:14:12]</a>. He recognized the "mispricing" in Series A investments post-product market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>.
*   **Peter Fenton:** Excelled in enterprise software and open-source, investing in Twitter, Docker, Zora, and New Relic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:56">[02:51:56]</a>.
*   **Mitch Lasky:** A games industry expert who led investments in Snap and Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:54">[02:40:54]</a>.
*   **Matt Cohler:** Brought unparalleled insight into consumer social products and understood the potential of mobile advertising and the "smartphone as a remote control for the real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:56">[02:42:56]</a>. He led the investment in Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:09">[02:46:09]</a>.

Fund Seven (2011), a $550 million fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:28">[02:47:28]</a>, was the culmination of this era, described as "speed running in [[the_role_of_venture_capital_and_its_challenges | Venture Capital]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:41">[02:47:41]</a>, with investments in Uber, Snap, Discord, and Stitch Fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:17">[02:49:17]</a>. This fund achieved a 25x return before fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:13">[02:50:13]</a>.

### The Uber Saga and Its Aftermath

The Uber investment, while immensely profitable (worth $8 billion to Benchmark in 2018) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:17">[02:54:17]</a>, became the ultimate test for the partnership and the firm's principles. As Uber's valuation soared in the private markets (hitting $70-80 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>, and a series of controversies (e.g., Susan Fowler, delete Uber campaign) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:11">[03:00:11]</a> embroiled the company, Benchmark ultimately sued founder Travis Kalanick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:23">[03:00:23]</a>.

This unprecedented move, suing an iconic founder, created "existential risk to their reputation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:51">[03:06:51]</a>. While the direct impact on Benchmark's deal flow has been debated, it undeniably "precipitate[d] the end of the Fab Four era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:34">[03:09:34]</a>. Matt Cohler and Mitch Lasky stepped back from active GP roles in Fund Nine (2017), with Bill Gurley following later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:11">[03:10:11]</a>.

## The Current Benchmark Partnership

Today, the Benchmark partnership continues its generational transfer. Peter Fenton remains as an elder statesman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:35">[03:19:35]</a>. New partners include:
*   **Eric Vishria** (joined 2014): Former VP of Marketing at Loudcloud/Opsware, known for his "understated" yet "Class Act" demeanor and killer investments like Confluent and Benchling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:32">[03:11:32]</a>.
*   **Sarah Tavel** (joined 2017): The first woman GP at Benchmark, a "spec hire" from Greylock (after stints at Bessemer and Pinterest), known for her analytical approach and marketplace investing, with a notable early investment in Chainalysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:02">[03:15:02]</a>.
*   **Chethan Puttagunta** (joined 2018): Another "spec hire" from NEA, with early successes in enterprise like Elastic, MuleSoft, and MongoDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:49">[03:17:49]</a>.
*   **Miles Grimshaw** (joined 2021): From Thrive Capital, with early investments in companies like Benchling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:46">[03:18:46]</a>.

This current five-partner team maintains the core principles of the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:45">[03:19:45]</a>.

## Key Dynamics of Benchmark's Partnership Culture

Benchmark's enduring success stems from several unique cultural and dynamic elements:

### 1. [[venture_capital_strategies_and_firm_architecture | Counter-Positioning]] and [[importance_of_curiosity_and_collective_dialogue_in_venture_firms | Equal Partnership]]
Benchmark's model is a pure illustration of [[the_role_of_venture_capital_and_its_challenges | counter-positioning]] against traditional VC structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:01">[03:28:01]</a>. The equal partnership, with equal economics for all GPs, eliminates internal competition for credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a>. This fosters "unbelievable trust" and forces "even the most competitive people... to have a sense of teamwork" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. It creates a culture where partners feel "psychological safety" to take risks, knowing their peers support them without conflicting incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:30">[01:52:30]</a>. This also acts as a barrier to entry for imitators, as it requires every partner to "bring it at an equal level" of effort and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:12">[01:46:12]</a>.

### 2. The "All-Star Team" Dynamic
Unlike firms structured like a "Yankees" organization with a clear CEO, Benchmark operates as an "All-Star team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:26">[03:26:26]</a>. This requires constant high performance from all partners and an implicit understanding that partners "retire once they sort of age too far out of their 40s" to maintain the firm's intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:53">[01:46:53]</a>. The firm's partners are not managers, nor do they have other career aspirations, allowing them to dedicate "100% of their time to their portfolio companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:03">[03:38:03]</a>.

### 3. Adaptability and Continuous Learning
Benchmark is not a "thesis-driven firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:04">[03:09:04]</a>. Instead, its partners are "learning machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:48">[03:39:48]</a>. They famously host dinners where they invite CEOs of companies they missed to understand their mistakes and adjust their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:23">[03:40:23]</a>. The firm is "experimental," constantly willing to "break [its] rules when it makes sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:22">[03:41:22]</a>, as seen in their past forays into growth or public market investing. This [[importance_of_curiosity_and_collective_dialogue_in_venture_firms | collective dialogue]] is key.

### 4. Focused Approach and Founder Relationship
Benchmark operates with a philosophy of not scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:52">[01:39:52]</a>, believing that this allows them to provide "maximum investment flexibility" and "right level of partner attention" to portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:28">[03:31:28]</a>. Their money is valued by founders not just for the capital, but for the "guarantee" of a subsequent Series B round at good terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:51">[03:33:51]</a>. This also means their board meetings are not "pitches" for the next round, fostering a more genuine relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:41">[03:36:41]</a>. The firm generally focuses on a high conviction, active board seat strategy, with partners taking about one board seat per year and aiming for 15-20% ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:46">[02:53:46]</a>.

## The Future: Consumer or Enterprise?

Historically, Benchmark's biggest wins have been in consumer companies (e.g., eBay, Uber, Snap, Discord, Riot Games) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:12">[02:42:12]</a>, often from "contrarian bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. The current partnership, while including a strong consumer investor in Sarah Tavel, appears to have a significant focus on enterprise and B2B SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:22">[03:43:22]</a>. The question remains whether Benchmark will continue its legacy of breakout consumer investing or if its future will primarily be defined by high-performing enterprise investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:47">[03:43:47]</a>. The ability to navigate this shift while [[maintaining_focus_in_venture_capital_amidst_growth_opportunities | maintaining focus]] will be key to their continued success in the evolving landscape of [[exploration_of_themes_in_venture_capitalism_and_entrepreneurship | venture capitalism and entrepreneurship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>.

The purpose of copyright law is to stimulate innovation and creativity across various forms of intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, and patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This foundational principle is important when considering how the music industry's business models have evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Two Core Copyrights in Music
When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:

1.  **Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording)**
    This copyright protects the literal recording of the music as it was produced in a studio and can be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Traditionally, the master recording is owned by the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Labels acquired ownership in exchange for assuming the financial risk involved in distributing and promoting the artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

2.  **Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)**
    This copyright covers the underlying written lyrics and melody of a song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It represents the "idea of the song" as if it could be put on sheet music, before it is actually played and recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. These rights are traditionally held by the songwriters themselves, often managed through music publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Songwriting credits and associated splits can be privately negotiated among co-writers, with arrangements ranging from 50/50 to flat fees or variable royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Historical Power Dynamics and Splits
The use of music often requires approval from either one or both of these copyright holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Both the owner of the sound recording master and the owner of the publishing right can have a veto on how the final product is used for cases requiring both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The income splits generated from different uses vary wildly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Publishers' Role
Historically, music publishers were incredibly powerful before recorded music became prevalent, as publishing rights (sheet music rights) were the major source of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. In that era, singers and songwriters were often not the same, leaving artists and recording labels at the mercy of publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Publishers would traditionally take 50% of the royalties from the composition copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Today, their share is significantly less, sometimes just a fixed fee for administrative services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Record Labels' Dominance
When artists signed distribution deals with record labels, receiving an advance to make an album, the labels would then own the master recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The artist's royalty stream, though independently negotiated, typically amounted to only 10-15%, possibly up to 20-22% for very big artists, with the vast majority going to the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Even this split for artists was considered "very good" compared to the deals with labels on the master side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Recoupment Model
A crucial aspect of these deals was the concept of [[economic_splits_and_recoupment_in_music_deals | recoupment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Artists only began to participate in revenues after the initial advance provided by the record label was "recouped" or paid back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. For example, if a label gave an artist a $500,000 advance, the label would keep the first $500,000 generated from album sales or streaming before the artist received any of their royalty share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This system is analogous to a [[business_models_in_the_digital_media_and_subscription_space | VC preference stack]] on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## The Rationale Behind Old Models
These seemingly "predatory" deals were a product of their era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. In the past, it cost a significant amount of money to produce an album, and even more to distribute it, get it on radio, and acquire fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

[!NOTE] High Failure Rate
Similar to startups in venture capital, most artists would fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Record labels, like [[business_models_in_the_digital_media_and_subscription_space | VCs]], would sink substantial money into numerous projects, with the expectation that the few successful ones would generate enough profit to cover the losses from the many failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Shifting Landscape
The need for such economic splits was based on the "old world" model where significant upfront investment was required before an artist's audience potential was known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. However, it is noted that [[the_evolution_of_record_deals_in_the_music_industry | this dynamic has completely changed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, implying a major shift in the underlying economics of the music industry. This hints at the ongoing [[importance_of_adapting_business_models | importance of adapting business models]] in response to technological and market changes.

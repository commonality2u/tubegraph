The story of [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Uber]], leading up to its [[fundraising_and_initial_public_offering | IPO]] and the subsequent "implosion," is the subject of a Showtime series titled "Super Pumped," which premiered on February 27th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This story, described as "insane," has become a part of entertainment and pop culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## The Story of Uber: Themes and Depictions

The show "Super Pumped" explores [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Uber]] as an example of a broader trend where the primary focus is "profits above all" and "shareholder value up before everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This mentality emphasizes "growth growth growth" without regard for impact or consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Silicon Valley is depicted as excelling in this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

The series aims to raise questions about the cost of disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. It asks whether the benefits of new utility and changing infrastructure, such as convenience, are worth the consequences on the other side of the ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Another key question posed is whether revolutionaries, in their effort to unseat established systems, can avoid becoming destructive themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

The show's creators believe that the [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Uber]] story is crucial for telling a significant narrative about America at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. It highlights the fascinating, albeit sometimes problematic, nature of the individuals involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Key Figures in Uber's Narrative

### [[the_influence_of_travis_kalanick | Travis Kalanick]] (TK)
[[the_influence_of_travis_kalanick | Travis Kalanick]], played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in "Super Pumped," is portrayed as a figure driven by an "animal instinct" to take what he wants without regard for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The show depicts the consequences he faced for indulging this urge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. While the series does not shy away from his questionable decisions and arguably unethical behavior, it also aims to show him as a whole human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. Many people who worked with [[the_influence_of_travis_kalanick | Travis Kalanick]] found him inspiring, compelling, and full of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

### Bill Gurley
Bill Gurley, a prominent venture capitalist, is a primary character in "Super Pumped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. The show explores the challenging moral questions he faced, particularly regarding his role in removing [[the_influence_of_travis_kalanick | Travis Kalanick]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. The question is posed: which is the worst costâ€”leaving a situation that might imperil the entire endeavor, or engineering the removal of a person, thereby cementing one's own reputation in a way that harms the overall project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>?

### Garrett Camp
Garrett Camp is identified as a more "artist-like" figure within the [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Uber]] story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. His previous venture, StumbleUpon, is described as an "art project" that was "not a business" but provided a "total adventure on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Garrett's initial inspiration for [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Uber]] reportedly came from a scene in *Casino Royale* where James Bond summons a car with his phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>.

## Production of "Super Pumped"

The series is based on Mike Isaac's book, and Isaac was actively involved in the production, serving as a co-executive producer and frequently present in the writer's room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. He provided notes and sometimes brought in sources directly to share their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. The show's creators intentionally did not interview the real-life individuals portrayed in the series, instead relying solely on Mike Isaac's book for source material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

Most of the filming was done in Los Angeles, primarily on the Paramount lot in sound stages, with only a few days of exterior shots in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. The series employs non-mainstream filmmaking techniques and takes bold risks with storytelling conventions, such as showing [[the_influence_of_travis_kalanick | Travis Kalanick]]'s apocryphal memories before revealing what "really happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. This approach leverages the theme of disruption within the story itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

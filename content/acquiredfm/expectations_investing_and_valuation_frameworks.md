In this special episode of the Acquired podcast, hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal sat down with Michael Mauboussin, an influential figure in the world of investment and the head of Consilient Research at Counterpoint Global. With extensive experience and a deep understanding of markets, Michael shared insights into expectations investing, valuation frameworks, and the impact of macroeconomic conditions.

## What is Expectations Investing?

Expectations investing is an investment strategy focused on understanding the expectations embedded in a stock price and determining whether they are too high, too low, or just right. Michael Mauboussin highlights that the core idea revolves around reverse engineering a stock's current price to ascertain the expectations implied by the market.

> A stock price reflects a set of expectations about future financial performance. The essence of expectations investing is to identify those expectations and assess whether they are reasonable or misaligned. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>)

### Steps in Expectations Investing

1. **Reverse Engineering Expectations**: Investors start by asking, "What do I have to believe for this stock price to make sense?" This involves dissecting the stock price to uncover the expectations about future performance. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>)

2. **Strategic and Financial Analysis**: The next step involves a comprehensive analysis to judge whether the identified expectations are overly optimistic, pessimistic, or accurate. This includes evaluating a company's strategic position, competitive landscape, and financial health. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>)

3. **Take Action**: Based on the analysis, investors decide whether to buy, sell, or hold the stock. An investor's view on whether the stock is over or underpriced will guide their decision-making process. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>)

## The Evolution of Valuation Frameworks

One significant advancement in valuation frameworks is the increasing importance of intangible assets. Mauboussin emphasizes that traditional valuation often focused on tangible assets, but today's economy is largely driven by intangibles such as intellectual property, branding, and human capital. This mirrors how the [[nvidias_evolution_and_future_potential | evolution of Nvidia]] transitioned from focusing on hardware to leveraging its technological advancements in AI and machine learning.

### Intangibles versus Tangibles

- **Historical Perspective**: In 2001, capital expenditures and intangible investments were roughly equal among public companies. By 2021, intangible investments had doubled those of tangible investments, highlighting a dramatic shift in how companies derive value. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>)

- **Implication for Valuation**: This shift necessitates different considerations in valuation, where understanding the true drivers of a company's economic performance requires looking beyond traditional financial measures. Companies like [[nvidia | Nvidia]] have integrated intangible assets like software and AI capabilities into their valuation strategy, leading them to a prominent position in the tech industry.

## Complexity in Market Expectations

Today's tech-driven world makes market expectations more complex than the cash flow analysis of the past. As David Rosenthal points out, expectations embedded in valuations often include broader strategic goals, synergies, and market dominance aspirations rather than just next year's financial performance.

## Conclusion

Expectations investing and evolving valuation frameworks provide modern investors with robust tools to navigate today's complex markets. By reverse-engineering market expectations and understanding the pivotal role of intangible assets, investors can make more informed decisions in a world where financial analysis must adapt to rapid innovation and changing economic landscapes. This approach is reminiscent of [[strategic_investing_perspectives | strategic investing perspectives]] that align with successful tech giants' pathways like Nvidia.

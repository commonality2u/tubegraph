Costco's unique business model heavily relies on its distinctive approach to [[Costcos Business Model and Success | supplier relations]] and strategic vertical integration, aiming to provide [[Costcos Business Model and Success | extreme value]] to its members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:23">[02:01:23]</a>.

## Supplier Relations: Tough But Fair

Costco's relationship with its [[Costcos Business Model and Success | suppliers]] is fundamentally different from other large retailers like [[Walmarts operational strategies and innovations | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>. While [[Walmarts operational strategies and innovations | Walmart]]'s approach is designed to squeeze [[Costcos Business Model and Success | suppliers]] as much as possible, Costco's is characterized by being "tough but fair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a>.

A core tenet of Costco's code of ethics is to "respect our [[Costcos Business Model and Success | suppliers]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. This means Costco buyers work closely with [[Costcos Business Model and Success | suppliers]] to understand their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. When a [[Costcos Business Model and Success | supplier]] attempts to increase a price, Costco buyers ask "why" and are deeply knowledgeable about commodity prices of ingredients, like cocoa for a chocolate product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>. This allows them to challenge price increases when commodity prices fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:34">[01:27:34]</a>.

The ability to maintain this tough-but-fair stance is directly linked to Costco's low SKU count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:16">[01:27:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>. Each buyer manages a very tight set of relationships, adding only 3-15 new SKUs annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>. This focus ensures deep product knowledge and negotiation leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>.

Because Costco caps its gross margins at a maximum of 14% (and often lower, around 11% for general merchandise and 6-8% for electronics), most of the savings gained from [[Costcos Business Model and Success | supplier]] negotiations are passed directly to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>. For every dollar a [[Costcos Business Model and Success | supplier]] reduces a price, members see approximately 89 cents of that benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>.

Costco's massive purchasing volume, despite its lower overall revenue compared to [[Walmarts operational strategies and innovations | Walmart]], makes it a critical customer for many [[Costcos Business Model and Success | suppliers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. The average revenue per product at Costco is about ten times that of [[Walmarts operational strategies and innovations | Walmart]] due to fewer SKUs, creating a lopsided relationship where Costco is often the largest buyer for a given [[Costcos Business Model and Success | supplier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:52">[02:11:52]</a>.

Some [[Costcos Business Model and Success | suppliers]] are mandated to create unique SKUs for Costco that cannot be purchased elsewhere, such as a blender with extra cups or a two-pack of Sonicare toothbrushes with additional heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:05">[02:26:05]</a>. This creates a "Walled Garden" effect within Costco, where customers cannot easily comparison shop identical items outside the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:38">[02:25:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>. Even brands like Nike, which typically refuse to sell on [[Amazons strategic intentions | Amazon]], sometimes sell through Costco to manage inventory challenges, highlighting Costco's unique position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:32">[02:26:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:51">[02:26:51]</a>.

## Strategic Vertical Integration

While Costco generally maintains a low-overhead, operationally lean model, it strategically engages in vertical integration when it believes it can deliver greater value to its members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:19">[02:27:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:57">[02:27:57]</a>.

### The Chicken Business

One of the most notable examples of Costco's vertical integration is its chicken processing operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:42">[02:27:42]</a>. Costco sells 500 million chickens a year in the U.S. and Canada, with 130 million of those being its famous rotisserie chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:09">[02:28:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:16">[02:28:16]</a>. Recognizing that a few large chicken processing companies in America could artificially inflate prices due to [[Costcos Business Model and Success | supplier]] concentration, Costco decided to take on the complex work of processing chickens itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>.

Initially, they rented 100% of the capacity of a plant in Alabama to learn the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:08">[02:29:08]</a>. They then built their own fully-owned facility in Fremont, Nebraska, establishing relationships with 150 local farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:30">[02:29:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:37">[02:29:37]</a>. This facility alone processes two million chickens per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:42">[02:29:42]</a>. With two other dedicated facilities that operate exclusively for Costco, they can now process 200 million chickens annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:50">[02:29:50]</a>. This vertical integration allows Costco to keep other large chicken processors honest on pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:01">[02:30:01]</a>. The chickens are also used in their food court items, such as the chicken bake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:37">[02:28:37]</a>.

### Other Examples

Costco also applies vertical integration in other areas where they can "clean up" the [[Costcos Business Model and Success | supply chain]] and provide a better product for less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:22">[02:30:22]</a>. This includes:

*   **Fancy Mixed Nuts**: They work directly with farmers and [[Costcos Business Model and Success | suppliers]] to ensure quality and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:20">[02:30:20]</a>.
*   **Coffee**: They source and process their own coffee to bring down prices and increase fair trade options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:29">[02:30:29]</a>.
*   **Eyeglasses**: To combat artificially high prices in the eyeglass industry, Costco owns and operates three optical grinding labs to produce prescription eyeglasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:45">[02:52:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:02">[02:53:02]</a>.
*   **Baked Goods**: Muffins and other baked goods sold at Costco are prepared in their in-store bakeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>.
*   **Hot Dogs**: Costco vertically integrates its hot dog production to maintain the famously low $1.50 price for a hot dog and soda combo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:13">[02:30:13]</a>.

This willingness to take on additional complexity and overhead demonstrates Costco's commitment to prioritizing member value, even if it means venturing outside traditional retail operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:37">[02:30:37]</a>.

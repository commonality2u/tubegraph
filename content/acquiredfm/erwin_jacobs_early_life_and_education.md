[[Irwin Jacobs]] was born in 1933 in New Bedford, Massachusetts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. New Bedford was once considered the wealthiest town in America during the whaling era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He grew up in a middle-class family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, where his father managed a local restaurant called the Boston Beef Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Academic Path

From a young age, Jacobs showed exceptional talent in math and sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Despite his interest, his high school guidance counselor advised him that there was "no future for Math and Science in New Bedford" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Given his strong grades, the counselor encouraged him to attend the Cornell School of Hotel Management with the intention of him returning to work in his family's restaurant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Jacobs initially enrolled in the hotel management program at Cornell, spending a year and a half there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. He later credited this period with providing him valuable knowledge in business accounting and real-world applications, which proved instrumental in his later ventures, including starting his first company and ultimately Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

After realizing that engineering offered a viable path to apply his math and science skills, Jacobs sought to transfer to electrical engineering. When he informed the dean of his desire to switch from hotel management to electrical engineering, the dean was surprised but eventually allowed the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Advanced Degrees and Early Career

Following his time at Cornell, Jacobs pursued a PhD at MIT, completing the program in an impressive three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. He finished his PhD in 1959, studying under [[Jim Simons and his career | Claude Shannon]], the "father of information theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This mentorship under Shannon was critical to his future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Immediately after earning his PhD, Jacobs was asked to remain at MIT as a professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He taught there for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, during which he taught what is believed to be the world's first course on digital communications, applying Shannon's theories for practical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. He also co-authored the first textbook on digital communications, which remains a foundational text in the field today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California, where he worked on communications for the U.S. Space Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It was at JPL that he met Andrea Viterbi, another recent MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate, who became a close friend and future collaborator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Move to UC San Diego and Linkabit

Upon returning to Boston, Jacobs received an offer from a former Cornell professor to help establish the electrical engineering department at the newly forming UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. He accepted the offer, moving his family to San Diego, influenced by his positive experience in California and the presence of his friend Viterbi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

While working as the first electrical engineering professor at UCSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, Jacobs continued his consulting work with defense contractors and JPL, particularly on the U.S. space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. During a flight back from a consulting trip at NASA Ames, Jacobs, Viterbi, and a third professor from UCLA, Len Kleinrock, decided to form a "shell company" to manage their growing consulting work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. They humorously named it Linkabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

Kleinrock eventually left Linkabit, but went on to become a core founding father of the internet, notably by sending the first message on ARPANET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Jacobs and Viterbi continued with Linkabit, focusing on NASA and Navy defense projects, specifically satellite communications that required highly efficient use of narrow bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This work led them to utilize spread spectrum technology, patented by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

Linkabit grew, bringing in other professors and graduate students, forming a team of experts in information theory and wireless signals for defense contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. By 1971, the company's activities were so substantial that Jacobs took a sabbatical from UCSD to organize the company, and he never returned to academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Recognizing that primary contractors earned more than subcontractors, Linkabit transitioned from solely consulting to bidding on projects themselves, aiming to become a "product-like, contract-focused services company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This shift led them into the commercial sector. Linkabit's first commercial project was designing and implementing the satellite communication system for Walmart, enabling the retailer to connect its headquarters with its stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

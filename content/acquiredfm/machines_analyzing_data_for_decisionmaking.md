The evolution of software has seen a consistent theme: not all software, and not all [[ai_and_machine_learning_in_eda | AI]], is created equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This perspective highlights a shift in focus towards more sophisticated and purpose-built solutions, especially concerning data and its analysis.

## Historical Context: The Database Era

Rewinding to the year 2000, the largest sector of software was databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. At that time, the aggregate total enterprise value of companies primarily deriving revenue from databases amounted to approximately a trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Future of Data and Decision-Making

A significant challenge arises from the exponential growth of data; every year, more data is produced than in all previous years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This ever-increasing volume of data necessitates a suitable home, and the trend suggests that more sensors will be built in the future to gather even more data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Bill Gates' Vision

Bill Gates once articulated a transformative vision regarding [[evaluating_judgment_and_decisionmaking_in_potential_hires | decision-making]]. When asked if all interesting developments were already done, he emphasized the "barbaric" nature of current decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He predicted a future where:
> [!quote] Bill Gates on Future Decisions
> In the future, we will have all this data stored, and machines will analyze the data and help us make better [[evaluating_judgment_and_decisionmaking_in_potential_hires | decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
>
> These machine-aided [[evaluating_judgment_and_decisionmaking_in_potential_hires | decisions]] would span various domains, including:
> *   Diagnosing an illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
> *   Educating a dyslexic child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
> *   Maintaining an aircraft's engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
>
> He concluded that all future [[evaluating_judgment_and_decisionmaking_in_potential_hires | decisions]] would be made by machines analyzing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Cloud Infrastructure and Data Enablement

This vision strongly supported the view that the entire database market would undergo a significant transformation, being remade in the cloud and purpose-built for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Therefore, a primary focus was on the cloud infrastructure layer and all the necessary enablement to bring [[impact_of_ai_on_financial_services_and_operational_efficiency | enterprises]] into the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This strategic emphasis on integrating machine learning with [[importance_of_integrating_machine_learning_with_data_storage | data storage]] within cloud environments proved to be a "rich vein" for technological development and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

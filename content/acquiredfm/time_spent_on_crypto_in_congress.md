A member of the House Financial Services Committee estimates that roughly a third of their time during their term has been dedicated to cryptocurrency-related matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Beyond crypto, other primary areas of focus include work on China and capital markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Early in the term, significant effort was also directed at reforming international financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF, which were seen as largely influenced by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Focus on Capital Markets and Meme Stock Mania

A considerable amount of time was also spent on capital markets, particularly during the [[legislation_attempts_during_meme_stock_mania | GameStop meme stock craze]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This period was described as "interesting and fun" to follow on Wall Street Bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Despite extensive work, including four [[congressional_hearings_and_challenges_in_passing_reform_bills | hearings]] and national media attention, no new legislation emerged directly from the [[legislation_attempts_during_meme_stock_mania | meme stock mania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This outcome was disappointing given the effort invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

One proposed bipartisan solution was to shorten the settlement time for trades from two days to one, which would have reduced systemic risk and potentially prevented actions like Robinhood halting trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, instead of pursuing this, a bill was passed by the House that incorporated a collection of long-standing Democratic policy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This bill was not expected to advance in the Senate, meaning "nothing changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The issue ultimately became a "political casualty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Congressional Hearings and Public Reaction

The [[congressional_hearings_and_challenges_in_passing_reform_bills | hearings]] on the meme stock craze were particularly engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. During remote sessions, the committee member monitored real-time reactions on the Wall Street Bets forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Initially, members speaking during the [[congressional_hearings_and_challenges_in_passing_reform_bills | hearings]] were "absolutely eviscerated" by online comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, with one committee member even being compared to the character "Hitman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. However, once the committee member began asking questions, the tenor of the online comments shifted, indicating a more positive reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

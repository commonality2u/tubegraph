From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Walmart, a creation of Sam Walton, ushered in a new era of American and global retail, evolving from the post-World War II period to the present day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>. Today, Walmart is the largest company by revenue in the world, generating nearly $600 billion a year in sales, with Amazon close behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. It is also the world's largest employer, excluding public entities like governments, with approximately 2.3 million people employed globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. The company remains controlled by the Walton family, who own just over 50% of the business, a full 60 years after its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:51">[02:11:51]</a> 90% of America lives within 10 miles of a Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, with notable exceptions being San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and, spiritually, Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Sam Walton's Early Life and Influences

Samuel Moore Walton was born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, in March 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. His parents, Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, were farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. As America modernized post-World War I, Sam's father transitioned from farming to farm financing, becoming a mortgage broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. In December 1921, Sam's brother, James Lawrence "Bud" Walton, was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. The family later settled in Columbia, Missouri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl significantly shaped Sam and Bud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. During this period, their father, a farm financer, had to foreclose on farms, often bringing Sam and Bud along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. This experience instilled in Sam a deep understanding of money, as his parents "just didn't spend it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. This frugality would later define the Walton family, who became the wealthiest family in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.

As teenagers, Sam and Bud undertook various odd jobs to help their family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. Their mother started a milk business, which they helped with by milking cows and delivering to neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>. Sam also sold magazine subscriptions and raised and sold rabbits and pigeons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:15:00]</a>. Like [[warren_buffett_berkshire_hathaway | Warren Buffett]], Sam also had a newspaper route for the Columbia Missourian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. By the end of college, his newspaper activities earned him $4,000-$5,000 a year, a significant sum during the Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>. He became the Missourian's chief salesman, excelling at getting fraternity and sorority subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>.

At age 13, Sam became the youngest Eagle Scout ever certified in Missouri history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. He was also the quarterback of his high school football team, which won the state championship every year, and he never lost a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. This taught him "to expect to win, to go into tough challenges always planning to come out victorious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.

## Entry into Retail and Early Ventures

Sam attended the University of Missouri on an ROTC scholarship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. Though he initially planned to attend the Wharton School of Finance, he decided to get a "real job" due to financial constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. He accepted an offer from JCPenney (which he called "Penny") in Des Moines, Iowa, as a floor salesman, where he excelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. He even met James Cash Penney himself, who taught him efficient packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:00">[23:15:00]</a>.

His time at JCPenney lasted only 18 months, as he joined the Army after Pearl Harbor in December 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>. His brother Bud became a decorated bomber pilot in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:46:00">[23:46:00]</a>, but Sam failed the physical for combat duty due to a heart irregularity and stayed stateside for a desk job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.

While depressed in Claremore, Oklahoma, Sam met and fell in love with Helen Robson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>. Helen's father, L.S. Robson, was a wealthy financier who greatly influenced Sam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>. Helen, unusually for a woman at the time, had a college degree in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a>. Her family advised them to organize their businesses as a partnership, which they did in 1953, forming Walton Enterprises, which still owns 36% of Walmart today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>. This structure ensured family control and prevented corporate takeovers, a point Sam stressed to his descendants in his autobiography, *Made In America* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.

After the war, with Helen's family's financial support, Sam decided to become an entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>. His initial ambition to buy a Federated Department Store franchise in St. Louis was vetoed by Helen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>. She insisted on a family-owned and controlled business in a small town with a population of no more than 10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a>. This seemingly accidental decision became a [[walmarts_operational_strategies_and_innovations | core strategy]] for Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>.

### The Newport Ben Franklin Store

Sam approached Butler Brothers, a Chicago-based franchiser of Federated stores, who suggested a Ben Franklin Variety Store franchise in Newport, Arkansas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>. At the time, variety stores were glorified general stores, largely untouched by modern retail concepts like self-service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>. Most items were priced at five or ten cents, and customers relied on clerks to retrieve merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>.

In 1945, Sam and Helen purchased the distressed Newport store for $25,000, with $5,000 from their savings and a $20,000 loan from Helen's father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>. The store was losing money, had only $72,000 in annual sales, and faced stiff competition from a Sterling store doing double its sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:22:00">[37:22:00]</a>. Sam set an audacious goal: make it the most profitable variety store in Arkansas within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[36:58:00]</a>.

Sam's immediate action was to visit competitor stores, like Dunham's across the street, taking notes on their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>. This became a lifelong habit, as he would notoriously visit Kmart and other competitors with a notebook or tape recorder, observing and gathering insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:24:00">[38:24:00]</a>. He learned that aggressively cutting prices on "big marquee" items like health and beauty aids could drive customer traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13:00">[40:13:00]</a>.

To circumvent Butler Brothers' 25% markup on inventory, Sam began directly sourcing goods from manufacturers in the South and Midwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:32:00">[40:32:00]</a>. He would drive his pickup truck with a trailer to collect merchandise, price it low, and "blow that stuff out of the store" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a>. This aggressive "loss leader" strategy was a key [[discount_retail_evolution_and_walmarts_role | Sam Walton invention]], aiming to get people in the door to buy other items, a cornerstone of Walmart's future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. Sam's simple lesson: "by cutting your price you can boost your sales to a point where you can earn far more at the cheaper retail price than you would have by selling the item at a higher price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:55:00">[44:55:00]</a>.

By year five, the Newport store achieved $250,000 in sales with a $30,000-$40,000 annual profit, making it the most profitable and largest store by sales in Arkansas, and even the entire Midwest and South Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:37:00">[46:37:00]</a>. However, the landlord, recognizing Sam's success, chose not to renew his lease, forcing him to sell the business for $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:58:00">[47:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:00">[49:01:00]</a>.

## Founding of Walmart

In 1950, Sam and Helen relocated to Bentonville, Arkansas, a small town of 3,000 people with three existing variety stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:08:00">[50:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:32:00">[51:32:00]</a>. Sam's decision to move there was influenced by its proximity to Helen's family and good quail hunting opportunities in the four-state area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:19:00">[50:19:00]</a>.

Sam heard about a radical new concept being tried by two Ben Franklin stores in Minnesota: self-service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:26:00">[53:26:00]</a>. He traveled to Minnesota, observed the stores, and adopted the idea, stating, "I liked it so I did it too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:52:00">[53:52:00]</a>. On July 29, 1950, they reopened their Ben Franklin franchise in Bentonville as "Walton's Five and Dime," becoming the third self-service variety store in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:55:00">[54:55:00]</a>.

Walton's Five and Dime generated $90,000 in sales in its first year, demonstrating that shock value and novelty could attract customers even from other towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:51:00">[56:51:00]</a>. Sam realized that customers, even in small towns, desired first-class shopping experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:00">[58:47:00]</a>.

To expand, Sam and Helen made store managers partners in their individual stores, offering them a percentage of the profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. Existing store managers were also given the opportunity to invest in new store partnerships, aligning incentives for overall network success and information sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

Sam and Bud also opened a large Ben Franklin store in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of Kansas City, which generated $250,000 in annual sales in its first year, confirming the future of suburban shopping centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. They started building their own "family centers" – larger, self-service Ben Franklin franchises – achieving unheard-of sales numbers of $1-2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

In 1962, Sam approached Butler Brothers to partner on a new discounting model, but they declined, fearing cannibalization of their existing franchise network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. This rejection, reminiscent of Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum, led Sam to go it alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.

On July 2, 1962, the very first Walmart opened in Rogers, Arkansas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. The name "Walmart" was suggested by an early store manager, Bob Bogle, for its cost-effectiveness in neon signage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. Sam admired [[history_of_costco_and_price_club | Saul Price]]'s FedMart, influencing his choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

The first Walmart store was chaotic but appealing, offering "real discounting" where every item was priced lower than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:49">[01:22:49]</a>. It achieved $1 million in sales in its first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>. Subsequent Walmarts in Springdale and Harrison, Arkansas, confirmed the viability of the model in both larger and smaller towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>.

## Operational Strategies and Growth

Walmart's growth was fueled by relentless [[walmarts_operational_strategies_and_innovations | operational strategies and innovations]]. Sam initially believed he could only manage 10-20 stores, but his methods allowed for massive expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>. The legendary "Saturday morning meeting" (later monthly) was mandatory for all store managers to share P&L information and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>.

### Embracing Technology

In 1966, just four years after the first Walmart, Sam Walton, then 48, attended an IBM seminar in Poughkeepsie, New York, to learn about computing technology in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:54">[01:43:54]</a>. He recognized that computers would disrupt classic retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:20">[01:44:20]</a>. This marked Walmart's transformation into a technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:22">[01:45:22]</a>.

In 1987, Walmart invested $24 million in a proprietary satellite network to link all stores with two-way voice and data transmission and one-way video from Bentonville <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:48">[01:46:48]</a>. This allowed Sam to "virtually visit" stores and broadcast the Saturday morning meeting, enabling rapid information sharing and learning across the growing network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>.

### Distribution Network and Efficiency

Walmart's investments in technology led to the creation of its own sophisticated [[walmarts_operational_strategies_and_innovations | distribution center]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:39">[01:48:39]</a>. Unlike traditional warehouses, Walmart's distribution centers received bulk shipments from vendors, re-boxed items for individual store orders daily, and shipped them out using their own trucking lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:12">[01:49:12]</a>. This "go slow to go fast" approach, as Benchmark's Bill Gurley describes it, focused relentlessly on lowest possible cost and maximum efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a>. This allowed Walmart to price lower than competitors and still be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>. They strategically built distribution centers as hubs and then expanded stores outward within a one-day truck drive radius, filling in the territory back towards the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>.

### Public Offering and Explosive Growth

Walmart filed to go public in 1970 with 32 stores and about 1,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. The IPO, on October 1, 1970, raised $4.5 million, with 300,000 shares sold at $15 each to only 800 shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:54">[01:40:54]</a>. Initially, there was skepticism, but Walmart's top-line revenue grew 77% in its first year post-IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:34">[01:41:34]</a>.

For the entire decade of the 1970s, Walmart's compound annual revenue growth rate was an astonishing 40.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>. In the 1980s, it continued at 32.4%, even from a $25 billion revenue base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:06">[01:43:06]</a>. These two decades propelled Walmart to become, and remain, the highest-revenue company in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:10">[01:43:10]</a>.

### Competition and Market Dominance

In 1962, the same year as the first Walmart, other major retailers launched their own discounting concepts: Woolworth launched Woolco, Dayton Hudson Company (Target's parent) launched Target, and S.S. Kresge launched Kmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>. While Kmart became the dominant "gorilla" initially, leveraging existing supply chains to quickly open 250 stores doing $800 million in sales by 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>, Walmart's lean, purpose-built operations eventually allowed it to surpass them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>.

By 1990, Walmart passed Sears to become the largest retailer in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:55">[01:51:55]</a>. In the mid-to-late 1980s, Kmart, at its peak, made a series of "drunken acquisitions" including Sports Authority, OfficeMax, Waldenbooks, and Borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:05">[01:53:05]</a>. This distracted Kmart, which eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and merged with Sears in 2004, ultimately leading to their combined bankruptcy in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Later Innovations and Global Expansion

### Supercenters and Grocery Dominance

Sam Walton, after observing Carrefour's "hypermarkets" in Brazil in the late 1980s, sought to combine general merchandise with groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. His initial attempt, "Hypermart USA," was too large and didn't catch on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>. After his death in 1992, Walmart launched the "Supercenter" concept, a smaller-scale hypermarket that became dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:40">[01:57:40]</a>. Today, most Walmarts are Supercenters, which are no longer explicitly named as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>.

Walmart's Supercenters brought their low-price approach to groceries, making items typically 15% cheaper than comparable grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>. Walmart went from zero market share in U.S. groceries in the early 1990s to becoming the largest grocer in America by the end of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>. Today, Walmart holds over 20% of the U.S. grocery market, more than double its closest competitor, Kroger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a>. In its most recent fiscal year, grocery accounted for 55% of Walmart's total revenue, exceeding $300 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:22">[02:00:22]</a>.

### Sam's Club

Walmart launched Sam's Club in 1983, a membership-based warehouse club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:50]</a>. Sam's Club has been a successful part of the company, though it lags behind [[history_of_costco_and_price_club | Costco]], which operates on even thinner margins to offer lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:08">[02:19:08]</a>. The original target market for clubs like Sam's and Costco was small businesses, later expanding to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:43">[02:21:43]</a>.

### International Expansion

Walmart operates in 24 countries with 10,500 stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18">[02:17:18]</a>. International sales account for 18% of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>. While Mexico and Canada have been successful, Walmart pulled out of Germany and its acquisition of Asda in the UK was ultimately sold off for a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:36">[02:22:36]</a>. In 2018, Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart in India for over $16 billion, aiming to enter the Indian market, though its physical presence there remains small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:16">[02:23:16]</a>.

## [[walmarts_challenges_with_ecommerce_and_competition | Walmart's Challenges with E-commerce and Competition]]

Walmart was slow to adapt to the internet in the 1990s and early 2000s, not initially viewing it as an existential threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:13">[02:02:13]</a>. To bolster its e-commerce capabilities, Walmart made significant acquisitions, including Kosmix for $300 million in 2011 (which became Walmart Labs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:27">[02:03:27]</a> and Jet.com for $3.3 billion in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:43">[02:04:43]</a>. While Jet.com itself was eventually shut down, it served to bring talented e-commerce engineers and product people into Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:12">[02:05:12]</a>.

Walmart's e-commerce revenue (around $75 billion) is growing much faster than its overall revenue, but it's still only about 13% of total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:17">[02:06:17]</a>. The company's strategy leverages its physical stores and distribution centers for same-day grocery delivery and in-store pickup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:42">[02:06:42]</a>. They also launched Walmart+, a Prime competitor, which includes features like in-store phone scanning and checkout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:24">[02:07:24]</a>.

Despite these efforts, [[amazons_early_history_and_growth | Amazon's Early History and Growth]]'s e-commerce business is still five to six times larger than Walmart's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:33">[02:06:33]</a>. Walmart faces fierce [[walmarts_challenges_with_ecommerce_and_competition | competition]] from [[history_of_costco_and_price_club | Costco]], which wins on lower margins, and Amazon, which excels in convenience and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>. Traditional grocers like Kroger and Albertsons remain strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:21">[02:34:21]</a>. The proliferation of dollar stores (Family Dollar, Dollar General), which originated from remnants of old variety stores, also presents a different type of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:31">[02:34:31]</a>.

## [[walmarts_impact_on_communities_and_global_market | Walmart's Impact and Legacy]]

Walmart's impact on communities and the global market is complex. On one hand, it significantly saves consumers money, especially for middle and lower-income families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>. It also provides a large number of jobs, with opportunities for employees to invest in Walmart stock and profit-sharing incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:50">[02:48:50]</a>.

On the other hand, its relentless pursuit of lower prices with suppliers led to the offshoring of American manufacturing, with a significant portion of items sold in Walmarts being made in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:05">[02:50:05]</a>. This pressure also impacted product quality and labor costs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:08">[02:51:08]</a>.

In terms of environmental impact, Walmart, in the mid-2000s, embraced sustainability as a means to generate efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:49">[02:51:49]</a>. It became the largest U.S. commercial producer of solar power by installing panels on its roofs and parking lots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:25">[02:52:25]</a>. They also significantly improved the efficiency of their trucking fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:36">[02:52:36]</a>.

Walmart's scale makes it a "microcosm of America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Issues like labor relations, environmental impact, and gun sales are amplified due to its vast network of employees and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:17">[02:43:17]</a>. The company has adjusted its gun sales policies over time, for example, stopping the sale of handguns in the 1990s and assault rifles in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:55">[02:53:55]</a>.

## Sam Walton's Playbook Lessons

Sam Walton's journey and Walmart's success offer several key lessons:

*   **Learn from Competitors**: Sam famously advised his managers to "go in and check our competition... Don't look for the bad, look for the good... we're concerned with what they're doing right and the reason that this grabbed me so much organizational Dynamics and behavior and just human behavior is such that your competitors you always want to like look for what they're doing wrong and make yourself feel better by like oh like they suck look how much better we are than them oh that's such a good point especially I don't know if you see this but being VCS and you know we invest in so many wonderful Founders and work with folks but this is really like a disease that I've noticed over the years that startup Founders and management teams they look for the worst in their competition and they make themselves feel better about how great they're doing we're guilty of it too but that is so the wrong way to look at it right a much better way to look at it is it doesn't matter what they're doing wrong look at what they're doing right and steal it most time you talk to a founder and of course like most times we talk to Founders they're pitching for investment so they're gonna have a different posture but it's oh yeah that is another company in our space yeah here's why they're doing it wrong here's why that's the wrong approach if you look at a Jensen Huang take on this his would be like oh it turns out actually everyone else doing three-sided polygons that was right so we're gonna do everything we can to immediately move to that you're right Sam woke up every day and thought how can we go find something a competitor is doing right and steal it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:57">[02:37:57]</a>.
*   **Identify and Ride a Wave**: Sam recognized the emerging wave of [[discount_retail_evolution_and_walmarts_role | discounting]] and built his company to capitalize on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:12">[02:40:12]</a>.
*   **Don't Buy Inefficiency**: To compete on price, companies must ruthlessly avoid purchasing anyone else's inefficiency, often leading to contentious relationships with suppliers but ensuring the lowest possible costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:08">[02:41:08]</a>.
*   **Price Matters (in certain industries)**: In industries like retail, price is paramount, necessitating a constant focus on margins and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">[02:42:04]</a>.
*   **Build Core Infrastructure (when necessary)**: While often advised to focus only on core competencies, Walmart demonstrated that if best-in-class infrastructure for a new area doesn't exist, building it in-house can be crucial for competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:46">[02:44:46]</a>.

## Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers Analysis

*   **Counter Positioning**: In its takeoff phase, Walmart successfully counter-positioned itself against established retailers by focusing on small towns, an overlooked and underserved market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:09">[02:26:09]</a>. Big companies were not set up to serve these customers or their distribution chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:31">[02:26:31]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies**: Walmart is a prime example of scale economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:10">[02:27:10]</a>. Its massive scale allows it to purchase goods in larger quantities, negotiate lower prices from suppliers, and operate its own efficient distribution and logistics network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:21">[02:27:21]</a>. This enables it to price lower than competitors and maintain profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:21">[02:27:21]</a>.
*   **Branding (lack thereof)**: Unlike some companies that can charge more for their brand, Walmart's brand does not command a premium; customers shop there primarily for the lowest price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:43">[02:28:43]</a>.
*   **Process Power**: Walmart developed unique operational processes, particularly in its distribution and inventory management, that are difficult to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:03">[02:30:03]</a>. Its ingrained culture of ruthlessly driving down costs and passing savings to consumers (rather than taking higher margins) further cemented this power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:40">[02:30:40]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a> Each week, 230 million customers visit one of Walmart's stores globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:29">[02:17:29]</a>.

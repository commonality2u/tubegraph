Jim Weber is the CEO of Brooks Running, a company that has been described as having an "absolutely unbelievable and extremely undertold" story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Under Weber's [[Corporate Governance and Leadership | leadership]], Brooks transformed from a struggling shoe company into a thriving, billion-dollar enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. His journey is documented in his book, *Running with Purpose* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Early Career and Brooks' Dire State
Jim Weber's career prior to Brooks involved consumer products, banking, and turning around various businesses in the outdoor sporting goods sector, including divisions of Coleman Company (like O'Brien Water Sports) and Sim Sports (a snowboard company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This established a pattern of turning around struggling companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

He joined the board of Brooks in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. When he took the helm as CEO in April 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, Brooks was in crisis:
*   Losing $5 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   $30 million in debt and a week away from missing payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   A modest $60 million revenue business with extremely real costs in manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   The company, almost 90 years old, sold a random assortment of products at every price point to a diverse set of consumers, not just runners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This multi-category approach stemmed from an old industry mindset of keeping factories busy year-round, leading to low margins and tied-up inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Strategic Turnaround and Focus
Weber recognized an opportunity to play the long game and build a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. He bet the company exclusively on serving active runners, cutting all other business lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This decision to "burn the boats" was unprecedented in the industry, with many believing the company wouldn't survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Key aspects of the turnaround:
*   **Focus on Profitability**: Weber immediately reduced the overly ambitious profit plan to a more realistic one, leading to the team earning a bonus for the first time in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. This helped gain trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
*   **Cash Flow Generation**: Brooks generated $10 million in cash in the first nine months by shrinking the balance sheet and focusing the product mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
*   **Product Refinement**: A critical step was refining the Adrenaline shoe in 2001 for 2002, which became an "incredibly balanced shoe" and helped save the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
*   **Targeting Frequent Runners**: The insight was that running shoes are consumables, with frequent runners going through 2.6 pairs a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. Earning loyalty from these customers creates stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. The business is in "trainers," not just racing shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.
*   **Brand Positioning**: Brooks positioned itself around the individual runner, focusing on fitness and health rather than just podium finishes or Olympic victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. The brand is approachable and inclusive, welcoming everyone from beginners to marathoners, and emphasizes biomechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. This was in contrast to brands like Nike, whose name means victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

## Acquisitions and Berkshire Hathaway
Brooks' consistent performance and growth attracted attention.
*   **Russell Athletic Acquisition**: Brooks was sold to Russell Athletic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. Weber negotiated independence for Brooks within Russell, pitching them as "the crazy uncle out in Seattle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.
*   **Berkshire Hathaway**: Russell Athletic was later acquired by Fruit of the Loom, which was already owned by Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. Weber had a background knowledge of Warren Buffett's strategies from an internship in the 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. Although Fruit of the Loom initially wanted to integrate Brooks into their operations, which would have "killed Brooks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>, Weber again negotiated to retain independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.
*   **Direct Report to Buffett**: In 2012, after seeing a Wall Street Journal article mentioning Mark Zuckerberg wearing Brooks Adrenaline shoes, Warren Buffett reached out to Weber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Buffett decided to spin Brooks out from Fruit of the Loom, making it a standalone subsidiary reporting directly to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>. This offered Brooks a significant advantage with confident support and the ability to work through uncontrollables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

## Growth, Scrappy Marketing, and Pandemic Leadership
Under Weber's [[experiences_and_insights_from_leading_tech_founders | leadership]], Brooks grew significantly, reaching $160-170 million in revenue by 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>.

*   **Guerrilla Marketing**: In 2012, at the U.S. Track and Field Olympic Trials, Brooks flew a "Run Happy" banner on an airplane around the stadium, despite Nike's extensive sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. This led to Weber and his team being kicked out of the event, a story that "lived on in the industry forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
*   **Pandemic Response**: Brooks had a significant advantage during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its laser focus on runners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>. They observed Strava data showing increased activity and had field marketing teams counting runners in parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. Recognizing running as "COVID friendly," they turned their supply chain back on 6 to 12 weeks before others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. This strategic decision, enabled by their exclusive focus on performance running gear, led to 27% growth in 2020 and 31% in 2021, cracking the billion-dollar revenue mark (ending at $1.13 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>. Brooks became the number one running shoe brand in the U.S. in 2022, with a 21.5% share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

## Building a Moat and Future Vision
Weber emphasizes that Brooks' moat lies in its "business model execution at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.
*   **Product Excellence**: Consistently building great products with "runability, fit, feel, and ride" is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.
*   **Retail and Digital Partnerships**: Brooks has deep, broad partnerships with retailers and excels in digital marketing, reaching runners in active evaluation mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.
*   **Future Digital Strategy**: While major competitors struggled with digital apps, Brooks is building a "Brooks Run Club" to engage its loyal customers and is seeking sensor and data capture systems to understand runner biomechanics in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>.

Looking ahead, Brooks aims to be a global brand with 60 million customers (up from 15 million) and $4 billion in revenue, maintaining its premium positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. The riskiest part of the business is operational, particularly supply chain resilience and agility, as demonstrated by distribution center issues in 2019 and factory shutdowns in Vietnam during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

## Personal Perspective and [[Brad Gerstners career and entrepreneurial background | Leadership Insights]]
Jim Weber also shared how his battle with esophageal cancer changed his perspective. Despite a 20% five-year survival rate, he decided not to live in fear or bitterness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. He chose to "soak in everything" and enjoy his roles as CEO, father, husband, and papa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>. This personal challenge reinforced his commitment to enjoying the journey, not just focusing on fleeting finish lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

His story showcases significant [[Corporate Governance and Leadership | leadership]] acumen, strategic vision, and resilience, turning a failing company into a market leader.

> [!NOTE] Insights from Vanta CEO
> Christina Cassiopo, CEO and co-founder of Vanta, shared her belief that product development is more akin to art than industrial engineering, where outcomes can't be prescribed. In contrast, the go-to-market side (marketing, sales, customer success) for SMB/mid-market businesses should be run like industrial engineering, with predictable processes and metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>. She is proud of Vanta's ability to cross-pollinate between these two sides of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:26">[03:51:26]</a>.

Visa, along with Mastercard, has spent decades connecting banks, merchants, and consumers to enable global transactions with plastic cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Despite its global presence and recognition for reliability and security, most people cannot articulate what Visa does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Visa is not a bank; it does not extend credit, issue cards, or work directly with merchants or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. It bears no risk and functions purely as a network connecting banks to other banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Origins of BankAmericard

The story of Visa begins in 1958 in Fresno, California, with an event known as "the drop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Bank of America, then the largest bank in America and primarily a consumer bank based in California, mailed 65,000 unsolicited rectangular pieces of plastic to every customer in Fresno <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This initiative, called the BankAmericard, aimed to consolidate Bank of America's diverse small consumer lending programs (like washing machine or "buy now pay later" loans) into one efficient card, significantly reducing overhead and increasing loan volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Historically, transferring money in the U.S. was cumbersome, relying on cash or checks, which incurred discounts and long processing times due to manual clearing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Merchants often ran charge accounts for regular customers to streamline payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This evolved into brand-specific cards (e.g., Standard Oil of Indiana mailing 250,000 unsolicited cards in 1939) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, and later, local retailer consortiums for shared credit histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

Independent third-party networks emerged with Diner's Club in 1949 and American Express (AMEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Diner's Club focused on business travelers, charging restaurants 5-7% of the gross bill and later adding cardholder fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. AMEX, originally an express mail company founded by Henry Wells and William Fargo in 1850 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>, entered the charge card market in 1958, leveraging its existing relationships to quickly gain members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. These early systems were "closed loop," with one entity managing both the card issuance and merchant acquiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

BankAmericard's key innovation was allowing users to roll over balances into a loan, pioneering the modern credit card model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. This also meant that money often stayed within Bank of America's system, as both consumer and merchant frequently banked with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Despite initial losses of $20 million due to fraud and high delinquency rates (22% in Fresno) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>, Bank of America, due to its size, could absorb these losses and expand the program across California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. By 1961, the program became profitable, a secret that encouraged competitors to abandon similar efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

## Birth of Visa

In 1966, Bank of America unveiled phase two of its plan, creating the BankAmericard Service Organization to license the program to banks nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. Licensees paid a franchise fee and a percentage of gross transaction revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. By 1968, hundreds of banks and 6 million cardholders had signed up, including Barclays Bank in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

However, the rapid expansion highlighted operational challenges for licensees, particularly "interchange" – the process of settling transactions between different issuing and acquiring banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Bank of America had no solution as their in-state operations were "closed loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. This led to high costs and inefficiencies, as banks resorted to physically mailing sales drafts and negotiating individual discount fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

These tensions culminated in an October 1968 summit in Columbus, Ohio, where licensees confronted Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. Dee Hock, a relatively unknown program manager from Seattle National Bank of Commerce, proposed that a committee of licensees investigate and design a new operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

Dee Hock envisioned a "transcendental organization" to link diverse institutions into a global payment and credit network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. His pitch to Bank of America was that a fractional ownership of a global network would be far more valuable than full ownership of a limited one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

### National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI)

In Sausalito, California, Dee Hock and his committee designed the structure for National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI), the predecessor to Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. Key principles included:
*   **For-profit Non-stock Membership Corporation**: Ownership was based on "irrevocable, non-transferable rights of participation" and transaction volume contributed, ensuring members' long-term alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>.
*   **Self-organizing Body with Democratic Governance**: Every member had a vote, with an 80% threshold for changes, effectively centralizing power in Dee Hock's hands due to the difficulty of achieving consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>.
*   **Mission of Cooperation**: The organization facilitated cooperation among competing banks to grow the network beyond what any single institution could achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a>.
*   **Universal Operating Procedures**: Members agreed to be bound by a singular, modifiable set of rules, creating a standardized environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.

Miraculously, all 200+ BankAmericard franchisees signed up for NBI, partly due to Bank of America's support and Dee Hock securing a "hall pass" from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for the collaborative venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. This antitrust exception allowed the formation of a unified national payments network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>.

### Global Expansion and the "Visa" Name

In 1972, Dee Hock established a parallel international organization, making Visa global from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:59">[01:25:59]</a>. The name "BankAmericard" was unsuitable for international use, so an internal contest led to the adoption of "Visa" – a universally recognized word implying entry and ubiquity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>.

The rebranding also became a growth hack. New operating regulations mandated that all existing BankAmericards migrate to Visa cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:40">[01:35:40]</a>. Banks began sending unsolicited letters to existing cardholders to switch their accounts, sparking an "arms race" that saw the number of participating banks grow by 20% and active cardholders by 45% in just one year (1977-1978) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>. This propelled Visa past Master Charge (formerly Interbank) in scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>.

### Marketing Strategy

Under new CMO John Bennett, formerly of AMEX, Visa strategically positioned itself against American Express, leveraging AMEX's smaller merchant network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>. The campaign tagline, "It's everywhere you want to be," highlighted Visa's ubiquity and aimed to eliminate the social stigma associated with using credit cards for everyday purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:22">[02:21:22]</a>.

A pivotal moment was the 1986 global Olympic sponsorship. After AMEX declined the offer, Visa seized the opportunity, investing $40 million for the 1988 Olympics alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>. Becoming the exclusive payment provider at the Olympics further cemented Visa's global brand and normalized card usage, particularly among affluent travelers who might have previously favored AMEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:24">[02:23:24]</a>.

## Technological Innovation

Beyond its organizational innovations, Visa developed critical technology infrastructure:
*   **Transaction Authorizations (BASE I)**: Initially, transactions above a "floor limit" required manual phone calls between merchant banks and cardholder banks, taking up to 20 minutes and limited by business hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>. Dee Hock launched BASE I (BankAmericard Authorization System Experimental) in 1971 to automate this process via a nationwide telecommunications network and centralized data center in San Mateo, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:31">[01:57:31]</a>. This was built in-house in nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:25">[01:57:25]</a>.
*   **Settlement Digitization (BASE II)**: To replace paper-based reconciliation, Visa built an automated clearing house system for electronic settlement, akin to what the Federal Reserve was developing for checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>. BASE II allowed transactions to be settled in batch overnight, drastically reducing settlement time from a week to a day and saving millions in labor and postage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:12">[02:03:12]</a>.
*   **Data Center Redundancy**: Recognizing the single point of failure in their initial setup, Visa pioneered concurrent operations across multiple data centers, allowing both to run at full capacity and share operations, a practice now standard in data center architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:37">[02:06:37]</a>.
*   **Point-of-Sale Digitization**: Visa standardized on magnetic stripe technology for cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:17">[02:09:17]</a>. They then set a specification for digital point-of-sale terminals, leading to the rise of companies like Verifone, which mass-produced affordable devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:23">[02:10:23]</a>. Merchants were incentivized with transaction fee discounts for adopting these terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>. Visa even rented unused network capacity from CompuServe for transaction routing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>. This full digitization significantly reduced fraud, cutting chargebacks by 82% in pilot programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>.

## IPO and Modern Business Model

Visa's initial public offering (IPO) in 2008 was precipitated by a large class-action antitrust lawsuit brought by merchants in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:24">[02:25:24]</a>. To manage liability, Visa created special "B shares" for pre-existing shareholders (the banks) to absorb the lawsuit's costs, protecting new public shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:52">[02:26:52]</a>. The IPO raised $18 billion, becoming the largest U.S. IPO at the time, providing a lifeline to many banks during the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:35">[02:27:35]</a>.

Today, Visa's business model remains largely unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:15">[02:29:15]</a>. Transactions involve three main fees:
1.  **Interchange Fees**: The largest share (e.g., 1.6% of a 2% merchant discount rate) goes to the issuing bank (the cardholder's bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:21">[02:31:21]</a>.
2.  **Payment Processing Fees**: A smaller portion (e.g., 0.2%) goes to the acquiring bank (the merchant's bank) and potentially a technology provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:54">[02:31:54]</a>.
3.  **Network Fees (Assessment Fees)**: A very small percentage (e.g., 0.15-0.2%) goes to Visa itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:37">[02:32:37]</a>.

Visa's portion, though small per transaction, has virtually no variable costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:11">[02:33:11]</a>, contributing to its extraordinary profitability. Debit transactions have significantly lower fees due to less risk, and smaller merchants often pay higher percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:59">[02:33:59]</a>. Interchange fees are intentionally flexible to align incentives across the five-sided system (consumer, merchant, issuing bank, acquiring bank, and Visa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:45">[02:35:45]</a>.

### Key Statistics (FY2022)
*   **Volume**: $14 trillion processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:06">[02:46:06]</a>.
*   **Transactions**: Over 190 billion annually (27 per person on Earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:11">[02:47:11]</a>.
*   **Cards in Circulation**: 4.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:29">[02:47:29]</a>.
*   **Net Revenue**: $29 billion (up from $22 billion two years prior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>.
*   **Net Income Margins**: 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:23">[02:48:23]</a> (compared to Microsoft at 34%, Apple at 25%, Google at 21%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:52">[02:49:52]</a>.
*   **Gross Margins**: 98% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:19">[02:49:19]</a>.
*   **Employees**: 27,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:30">[02:50:30]</a>.
*   **Uptime**: 99.999% ("five nines") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:25">[02:51:25]</a>.
*   **Network**: 16,000 banks in 200 countries, with six data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:38">[02:51:38]</a>.

U.S. merchants paid an estimated $93 billion in Visa and Mastercard credit card fees in the last year, up from $33 billion in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:30">[02:55:30]</a>. This system has a regressive impact: wealthier consumers with rewards cards benefit, while cash-using households effectively subsidize them through inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:37">[02:41:37]</a>.

## Economic Impact and Power

Visa's immense profitability stems from its **scale economies** and **network economies**. Any investment Visa makes is amortized across billions of cards and thousands of banks, making it nearly impossible for new entrants to compete on fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:42">[03:05:42]</a>. Its five-sided network effect (consumer, merchant, issuing bank, acquiring bank, and Visa) creates an incredibly strong lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:17">[03:07:17]</a>. While there are no significant switching costs between Visa and Mastercard for banks today (due to the 1975 antitrust ruling allowing "duality" or multi-homing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:06">[03:09:06]</a>, there is high switching cost to *another* network.

Visa's business exemplifies "communist capitalism," where competitors band together to create more value than they could alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:38">[03:11:38]</a>. This "democratic communist capitalism" structure, involving thousands of banks, is uniquely resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:02">[03:12:02]</a>. The company also demonstrates "socio-technical innovation," combining organizational brilliance with world-class technology development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:21">[03:13:21]</a>.

Visa's **value creation** is undeniable, particularly in enabling e-commerce, which would have been significantly delayed or impossible without widespread credit card adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:14">[03:19:14]</a>. It provides guaranteed, instant payment with reduced risk, reducing the operational overhead and security costs associated with cash or checks for merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:50">[02:44:50]</a>.

However, its **value capture** is also substantial. The industry's incredible profit margins suggest that the market has evolved to allow these players to charge more than necessary to cover their costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:35">[03:15:35]</a>. The "fixed fee plus percentage" model can be particularly burdensome for small transactions or low-margin businesses, where payment processing fees can outweigh the cost of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>.

## Future Outlook

### Bear Cases
*   **Maturing Core Business**: Over 50% of consumer payments to merchants now occur on cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:05">[03:21:05]</a>. This strong tailwind for Visa's traditional growth will inevitably decelerate as market saturation approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:24">[03:21:24]</a>.
*   **Closed-Loop Systems**: The rise of super apps and integrated payment systems in countries like China (e.g., Alipay, WeChat Pay) poses a threat if a similar model gains traction in the West and disintermediates card networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:56">[03:21:56]</a>.
*   **Real-time Payment Networks**: Governments and financial institutions are developing real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems (e.g., FedNow in the US, Pix in Brazil, UPI in India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:32">[03:24:32]</a>. While lacking features like refunds or chargebacks, these can potentially become alternative rails for payments, especially as cross-border links emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Tech Giants' Disintermediation**: Companies like Apple (via Apple Pay) already take a small fee (e.g., 15 basis points) on top of existing card fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:41">[03:25:41]</a>. If Apple or Google were to acquire point-of-sale providers (like [[the_costco_business_model_and_its_success | Square]]) or become banks, they could create their own closed-loop payment networks, bypassing Visa's rails entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:19">[03:26:19]</a>. The shift to mobile payments also reduces the prominence of the card network in the consumer's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:04">[03:28:04]</a>.

### Bull Cases
*   **Tokenization**: The increasing use of tokenization (e.g., in Apple Pay) enhances security and privacy. Visa benefits by developing proprietary "token-based services" that are high-margin and offer new revenue streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:41">[03:31:41]</a>.
*   **Massive Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Visa argues that its current market (cards) is only $20 trillion of a total $200 trillion global payments volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:03">[03:33:03]</a>. They are targeting new areas:
    *   **B2B Payments**: With a TAM of $120 trillion, Visa aims to expand its role beyond traditional credit card usage in business-to-business transactions, leveraging services like corporate cards (e.g., Ramp, Brex) and developing new, more appropriate monetization models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:22">[03:33:22]</a>.
    *   **B2C Payments**: A $30 trillion opportunity, including disbursements from businesses to consumers (e.g., insurance payouts, refunds, gig economy payments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:15">[03:34:15]</a>. Visa Direct is a new service addressing this push-based payment segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:40">[03:34:40]</a>.
    *   **Cross-Border Payments**: International transactions yield significantly higher margins for Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>.
*   **Resilience and Past Performance**: Despite various "bear cases" throughout its history, Visa has consistently outrun headwinds and maintained robust growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:47">[03:30:47]</a>. Its enduring network effect and operational excellence suggest continued dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:21">[03:30:21]</a>.

## Trivia

Ironically, the BankAmericard credit card, still available from Bank of America today, runs on Mastercard's network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:15">[03:38:15]</a>.

Lockheed Martin is a critical piece of American infrastructure, serving as the nation's largest defense contractor and the U.S. federal government's largest contractor overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. American taxpayers pay Lockheed Martin approximately $50 billion a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. While they make "killing machines," many of these weapons are used as deterrents to maintain peace and defend the American way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The company's history is marked by daring innovators and hardcore engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Origins

The company known today as Lockheed Martin was formed from the merger of approximately 17 predecessor companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. It was originally two distinct companies: Lockheed and Martin Marietta, which merged in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### The First Lockheed Company

The first Lockheed company was founded in 1912 by Allen Loughead (pronounced "Lockheed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Allen eventually changed his surname and the spelling of his second company's name to "Lockheed" to avoid mispronunciations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. He started the first company with his brother Malcolm, who were contemporaries of the Wright brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Based in San Francisco, it operated primarily as a tourist attraction, offering flights over the bay with their single plane, the Model G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Malcolm later left to seek his fortune in the automobile industry in Detroit, where he invented the modern hydraulic brake system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

John Northrup was hired into this first Lockheed company to help design future airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. John later co-founded the second Lockheed company with Allen, then left to found Avion Corporation (which became part of Douglas, now Boeing), and eventually founded Northrop (now Northrop Grumman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

The first Lockheed company eventually went under <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. A few years later, the second Lockheed company was started and found success with the Vega airplane, a favorite of early aviators like Amelia Earhart and Wiley Post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This second company was sold to a consortium of Detroit auto moguls, including Charles Kettering (founder of Delco and head of research at GM, also of Memorial Sloan Kettering fame) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Their vision was to build the "General Motors of the air," but aviation did not become a consumer industry like automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Allen Lockheed departed, having little further impact on the company that still bears his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Rise of Modern Lockheed

The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression led the Detroit Aircraft Corporation (DAC) to bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The still-profitable Lockheed division was sold out of bankruptcy to young businessman Robert Gross for $40,000 in 1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Allen Lockheed had considered bidding $50,000 to buy his company back, but thought it too low to be taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This marked the founding of the modern Lockheed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Under Robert Gross and his brother Cortland, Lockheed was transformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Before World War II, in the 1930s, Lockheed built the famous Electra airplane, which Amelia Earhart disappeared in and was featured in the movie *Casablanca* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## World War II and the Birth of Skunk Works

World War II brought about a major transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Clarence "Kelly" Johnson, who started the famous Lockheed Skunk Works division, adapted the Electra into the Hudson bombing vehicle, of which the British Royal Air Force purchased about 3,000 units before the U.S. entered the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Kelly joined Lockheed in 1933 at 23 years old, right out of the University of Michigan, and was a principal engineer in designing the Electra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. He was nicknamed "Kelly" due to a childhood fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. He was known for his intuitive understanding of complex physics problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> and won the Collier Trophy twice, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

Once the U.S. entered the war, Kelly designed the P-38 Lightning fighter, which became the U.S.'s elite, fastest, most maneuverable aircraft, with over 10,000 units produced. It was flown by all top aces in the U.S. Army Air Corps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

By late 1944, a new challenge emerged: jet-powered fighter planes from Germany, such as the Messerschmitt Me 262 "Swallow," which flew at nearly 550 mph, over 100 mph faster than any Allied plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. The U.S. government tasked Kelly Johnson and Lockheed to develop a jet fighter prototype within 180 days that could exceed 600 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

Kelly hand-picked 23 engineers and 30 shop people and rented a circus tent in a Burbank parking lot next to a plastics factory for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. The strong smell from the factory, combined with a popular comic strip character's moonshine still called "the Skunk Works" in *Li'l Abner*, led to the division's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Within 143 days, this team built the Lulu Bell prototype, which became the P-80 Shooting Star, the U.S.'s first jet fighter plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. They outsourced the engine, using the British Halford H1B Goblin engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. Unlike the automobile industry, aircraft manufacturers typically don't make their own engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

After the war, Kelly and Lockheed's management decided to continue the Skunk Works division, provided it didn't incur excessive costs or distract from Kelly's duties as the new chief engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. The Skunk Works operated out of an unmarked building next to Burbank municipal airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. Kelly Johnson's 14 rules for Skunk Works emphasized restricting the number of people involved "in an almost vicious manner" and rewarding performance by merit, not by the number of personnel supervised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This contrasts with traditional corporate structures that often favor "empire building" through headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

## The Cold War and Unseen Innovation

The end of World War II gave way to the Cold War with the Soviet Union, which, for many Americans, presented an even greater existential threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. The detonation of the Soviet Union's first nuclear bomb in August 1949, coupled with fears of a first strike, led to the policy of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and deterrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. In this "war of perception," intelligence became paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

### The U2 Spy Plane

Skunk Works became the primary "sword and shield" for the U.S. government and military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. The U2 spy plane, brought into service in 1955 and decommissioned only in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>, was designed for reconnaissance over the Soviet Union at extreme altitudes. The CIA tasked Kelly Johnson to build a plane that could fly at 70,000 feet, far exceeding the typical 40,000-foot altitude of other aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. Challenges included developing new jet fuel (subcontracted to Shell Oil) and spacesuits for pilots, as humans could not survive at that altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

Lockheed and Skunk Works won the contract in 1953, completing and delivering the plane by July 1955 for $3.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. The U2's camera system, capable of taking photographs from 70,000 feet, was designed by Dr. Edwin Land of Polaroid, who also helped convince President Eisenhower to pursue the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

Testing of the U2 was conducted at Groom Lake, Nevada, a dry lake bed where nuclear bombs had been tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. This remote, secret location became known as Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. The unusual appearance of the U2 and later aircraft, along with pilots in spacesuits (which looked like aliens), contributed to UFO rumors, which served as good cover for the secret operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.

The first U2 overflight of the Soviet Union occurred on July 4th, 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>. The Soviets tracked it on radar at 70,000 feet, revealing their advanced radar capabilities, but they could not shoot it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. The Soviets kept silent about these flights, as admitting they tracked the U2 would reveal their inability to stop it, compromising their position of strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. This reconnaissance provided the U.S. with critical intelligence on Soviet nuclear sites and military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>.

On May 1st, 1960, the Soviets finally developed a missile capable of accurately reaching 70,000 feet and shot down a U2 piloted by Francis Gary Powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. Powers survived and was captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>. This incident, revealed by Khrushchev on the eve of a Paris summit, ended U2 overflights of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>.

### Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LM&SC) & Silicon Valley

To address the intelligence gap created by the U2 incident, a new, highly secretive Lockheed division was established: the Lockheed Missile Systems Division, later renamed the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LM&SC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. Initially set up in Burbank, it soon moved to Northern California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.

This move was due to the need for expertise in radar and computing for missile guidance systems, areas where Fred Terman, a Stanford Professor and former head of Harvard's Radio Research Lab during World War II, had gathered the world's leading minds at Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. Terman, as Stanford's Provost, fundamentally changed the university's tech transfer policy, encouraging students and professors to leave and start companies or work for defense firms for national service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. He also created the Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park) on campus to lease commercial space to corporations and the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

Lockheed became one of the first and largest tenants of Stanford Industrial Park in 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>. They also acquired 275 acres in Sunnyvale, building a massive campus with 137 buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. By 1959, LM&SC employed nearly 20,000 people in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale, growing to 30,000 by the mid-1960s, making it by far the largest employer in the nascent Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. For context, Hewlett-Packard, the largest tech company at the time, only had 3,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. Many people, including Jerry Wozniak (Steve Wozniak's father), moved to the area to work for Lockheed, directly influencing the growth of Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.

LM&SC took on two historically significant projects: naval-based ballistic missiles and spy satellites. These became the largest drivers of profit for Lockheed for decades, even keeping the parent company afloat during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

*   **Polaris Missile Program:** In 1955, the Navy contracted Lockheed to develop the Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>. The challenge was to fire intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from submarines, initially planned for surface launch, but eventually achieved underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>. The Polaris system, operational by 1960, revolutionized strategic deterrence by providing an undetectable second-strike capability from mobile nuclear submarines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>. Successor programs included Poseidon and Trident missiles, with the Trident achieving a 5,000-mile range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>.

*   **Corona Satellite Program:** LM&SC simultaneously developed a secret U.S. space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>. The first Corona satellite launched in August 1960, coinciding with early NASA missions, under the cover story of "discoverer" (life form research) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>. This satellite could photograph any ground location in its orbit at a resolution as low as five feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. The first Corona mission alone produced more photographic coverage of the Soviet Union than all previous U2 flights combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:24">[01:34:24]</a>. The system collected over 800,000 images throughout its program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

    A unique aspect of Corona was retrieving the film: a custom-designed "film bucket" (by General Electric) with retro-rockets would re-enter the atmosphere, deploy parachutes, and be caught mid-air by a C-130 airplane towing a claw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>. If missed, a salt plug would dissolve after two days, sinking the film to the bottom of the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:30">[01:37:30]</a>. The Corona and Agena rocket system (also designed by LM&SC) achieved circular orbit, polar orbit, 3-axis stabilization, ground command control, and returned man-made objects from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. These capabilities remained classified until 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>.

    Corona led to follow-up programs: Gambit (1963, "see it well," resolution under two feet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>, Hexagon ("see it all") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>, and Kennen (1977, "see it now," first real-time space-based surveillance system using digital photography and ground links) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>. LM&SC also did pioneering work in weather satellites and contributed to the development of the GPS system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>. LM&SC built the Hubble Space Telescope, which was launched to space by a Space Shuttle whose large orange fuel tank was built by Martin Marietta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:53">[01:45:53]</a>.

LM&SC became the "crown jewel" of Lockheed, often generating over 100% of the company's profits during difficult periods due to the high margins associated with its technology- and computing-heavy projects, unlike airplane manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:56">[01:49:56]</a>. LM&SC's operating philosophy emphasized a "threat-based need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>.

### SR-71 Blackbird

After the U2 incident, Skunk Works worked on a successor spy plane, the A-12 Oxcart (CIA contract) and its two-seater Air Force version, the SR-71 Blackbird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:36">[01:56:36]</a>. The goal was to make it so fast that it could outrun any missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:05">[01:56:05]</a>. The specification was Mach 3 or faster (over 2,000 mph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">[01:57:11]</a>. The SR-71 could travel two-thirds of a mile per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:41">[01:57:41]</a>, and its turn radius was wider than the state of Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>. It flies at 84,000 feet, where the sky appears black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a>. The plane's skin reached 500 degrees Fahrenheit, requiring it to be built entirely of titanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:18">[02:01:18]</a>. Lockheed used dummy corporations to source titanium from the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:52">[02:01:52]</a>. Due to thermal expansion, the plane had "panel gaps" on the ground and would leak fuel, requiring a special non-flammable fuel from Shell Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a>.

The Blackbird used Pratt & Whitney J58 engines with an "spike inlet system," a "supercharger" that provided three-quarters of the thrust needed for sustained Mach 3+ flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:23">[02:05:23]</a>. The SR-71 never carried guns; it only carried cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:36]</a>. Test flights began in April 1962 at Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:22">[02:07:22]</a>. The first official Blackbird flight was on December 22, 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:39">[02:08:39]</a>. It never was shot down in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:03">[02:09:03]</a> and was a pioneer in stealth technology, being undetectable by radar for its first four years of flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:43">[02:11:43]</a>.

The Blackbird program was hugely expensive ($33 million per plane, $300 million annually to operate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:54">[02:13:54]</a>. The Pentagon canceled further orders in 1970 and ordered the destruction of all titanium tooling to prevent future production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:26">[02:14:26]</a>.

## Post-Cold War & Consolidation

The 1970s brought hard times for Lockheed. They lost the F-16 fighter bidding to General Dynamics (though Lockheed later acquired General Dynamics' fighter business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:11">[02:15:11]</a>. Lockheed's attempt to re-enter commercial aviation with the L-1011 airliner resulted in a $2.5 billion loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:03">[02:18:03]</a>. The company also faced major bribery scandals involving foreign officials in the Netherlands, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, with the Japanese scandal bringing down their prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:12">[02:19:12]</a>. Cost overruns on military projects like the C5 Galaxy transport plane further eroded public trust, leading to a perception of Lockheed as a "corrupt vampire octopus military-industrial complex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:22">[02:20:22]</a>. Lockheed required a $250 million government bailout, which barely passed Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:31">[02:20:31]</a>. LM&SC's profits kept the company from going under during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:54">[02:20:54]</a>.

### Stealth Technology & the F-117 Nighthawk

In the mid-1970s, a Lockheed mathematician, Dennis Overholser, applied equations from a Russian paper to design an aircraft with an unprecedentedly small radar signature, making it appear as small as a "BB" on radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:50">[02:21:50]</a>. This concept, initially dismissed by Kelly Johnson as un-aerodynamic, led to the "Hopeless Diamond" prototype, code-named Have Blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:13">[02:23:13]</a>. Under Ben Rich, Kelly's successor as head of Skunk Works, Lockheed internally funded the prototype, taking a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:16">[02:26:16]</a>.

The Hopeless Diamond was proven radar-invisible in tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:42">[02:27:42]</a>. Skunk Works won the contract to build the Air Force's stealth fighter. They solved stability challenges using fly-by-wire computer control systems, marking the first significant use of computers in Skunk Works' design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:58">[02:29:58]</a>. The resulting F-117 Nighthawk, delivered to the Air Force starting in 1983 (59 units at $43 million each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, resembled an alien spaceship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:51">[02:29:51]</a>. Its faceted design was due to the computational limitations of modeling 3D stealth structures at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:26">[02:50:26]</a>. Interestingly, Sega co-developed the Model 3 arcade board with Lockheed Martin to model these stealth airplanes for video games like *Virtual Fighter* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:29">[02:51:29]</a>.

The Nighthawk's combat debut was during Operation Desert Storm in the Gulf War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">[02:30:28]</a>. It enabled "surgically precise raids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:26">[02:32:26]</a>, comprising 1% of air missions but 40% of all damaged targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:01">[02:33:01]</a>. This success, however, marked the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:15">[02:34:15]</a>.

### "The Last Supper" and Industry Consolidation

In July 1993, then-Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry called CEOs of major defense contractors to a dinner, explicitly instructing them to consolidate due to anticipated massive cuts in defense spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:37">[02:35:37]</a>. This event, termed "the last supper" by Martin Marietta's CEO, initiated an era of intentional government-mandated industry consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:17">[02:36:17]</a>. The goal was to maintain America's military-industrial base and capabilities despite a shrinking market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:21">[02:37:21]</a>.

In 1993, Lockheed purchased General Dynamics' fighter jet business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:52">[02:38:52]</a>. In 1994, Lockheed announced a "merger of equals" with Martin Marietta, which completed in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. The combined company, Lockheed Martin, integrated 17 previously independent entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:22">[02:44:22]</a>. They then acquired Loral's defense business for almost $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:25">[02:40:25]</a>.

In 1997, Lockheed Martin attempted to merge with Northrop Grumman, but the Department of Justice blocked it to preserve competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:47">[02:40:47]</a>. Concurrent with these mergers, Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997, partly due to the intense competition for the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:10">[02:42:10]</a>.

The F-22 Raptor program, initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 and F-16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:11">[02:48:11]</a>, aimed for 750 planes at $44 billion. It was ultimately reduced to 187 planes delivered, costing $62 billion total, or $360 million per plane due to R&D amortization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>. The F-22, built in 46 states, required 95,000 jobs, a factor that influences Congressional funding decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:01">[02:53:01]</a>.

The F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program is the largest ever defense equipment purchase. It was conceived as a common platform across armed services and allies to achieve economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:30">[02:54:30]</a>. Lockheed Martin won the initial order for approximately 3,000 airplanes, valued at a potential $200 billion total program cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:17">[02:56:17]</a>. The U.S. order alone is $30 billion for 398 planes, costing $750 million per airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">[02:57:07]</a>. The F-35 focuses on [[technological_advancements_in_aerospace | technology]] and information-based warfare rather than pure speed, featuring advanced communication and heads-up displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:28">[02:55:28]</a>. Components are subcontracted globally before final assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:36">[02:56:36]</a>.

## Modern Lockheed Martin

The U.S. national defense budget is $800 billion, about 3-4% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:30">[02:58:30]</a>. About half of this is spent on contractors like Lockheed Martin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:33">[03:00:33]</a>. Lockheed Martin is the single largest recipient of federal spending as a contractor, not just in defense, receiving $50 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:45">[03:00:45]</a>. This represents about 75% of their total revenue, with the rest coming from foreign governments (allies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:37">[03:01:37]</a>. The company operates at around an 8% net income margin, reflecting the cost-plus nature of government contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:51">[03:01:51]</a>.

Lockheed Martin's business segments today include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:44">[03:09:44]</a>:
1.  **Aeronautics:** (e.g., F-35, F-22, F-16, C-130J Hercules) F-35 is its largest program, generating 20% of all net sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:01">[03:10:01]</a>.
2.  **Missiles and Fire Control**
3.  **Rotary and Mission Systems:** (includes Sikorsky helicopters)
4.  **Space:** (includes Orion Capsule for NASA's Artemis Moon program and United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture with Boeing for launch capabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:31">[03:10:31]</a>. ULA was a "shotgun wedding" between the two companies, allowing SpaceX to emerge as a competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:29">[03:11:29]</a>.

Lockheed Martin functions as a diversified conglomerate, with its segments showing strong double-digit percentage contributions to both revenue and profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:03">[03:13:03]</a>.

## Playbook & Legacy

Lockheed Martin's existence serves a dual purpose: to create value for its stakeholders and to ensure the good of America and its interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:58">[03:18:58]</a>. The government plays a heavily interested role, often dictating market dynamics and industry structure to maintain military capability, even if it means fostering a [[militaryindustrial_complex | military-industrial complex]] with limited competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:24">[03:19:24]</a>. This contrasts with free market principles, as the government seeks to preserve its industrial base and skilled workforce for national security reasons, as seen in the 1970s when Lockheed was kept afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:51">[03:20:51]</a>.

A key takeaway from Lockheed's history, particularly the Skunk Works and LM&SC's early days, is the ability of small, focused organizations to achieve "unbelievable, unfathomable things" under tight deadlines and resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:41">[03:27:41]</a>. This mindset, characterized by Kelly Johnson's 14 rules and LM&SC's seven tenets, emphasizes rapid delivery of superior products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. This approach was directly injected into [[history_of_technology_companies | Silicon Valley]] by the military and Lockheed, influencing its operational ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:30">[03:33:30]</a>.

However, the modern defense industry, exemplified by programs like the F-35, has moved away from this "Skunk Works way," becoming characterized by massive budgets, long timeframes, and widespread subcontracting across many states and countries to secure political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:54">[02:52:54]</a>. This can lead to inefficiencies and slow innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>. The challenge for the U.S. is to find ways to rapidly innovate in new areas like software and cyber security, where traditional defense procurement models may be incompatible with the fast-moving nature of [[history of technology companies | technology companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:13">[03:04:13]</a>.

Ultimately, while Lockheed Martin remains a robust and protected business, the future of national security may rely on new approaches and motivated teams that can solve problems for the country in response to new threats, potentially outside the established defense contracting framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. As Operation Warp Speed for vaccines demonstrated, the capability to rapidly overcome barriers in response to a threat still exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:01">[03:31:01]</a>.

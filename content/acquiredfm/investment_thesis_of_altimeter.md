[[brad_gerstner_and_altimeter_capitals_success_story | Altimeter]] has maintained a consistent investment theme over the past decade: the belief that "not all software is created equal," nor is all AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Not All Software is Created Equal

To illustrate this philosophy, one can rewind to 2000, when the largest sector of software was databases, collectively holding approximately a trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Looking ahead, the firm observes that "every year we're producing more data than in all years of human history combined," necessitating a "home" for this ever-growing volume of information gathered by sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Vision of Data-Driven Decisions

This perspective aligns with a vision once articulated by Bill Gates. When asked if all interesting technological advancements were already complete, Gates emphasized the "barbaric" nature of current decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. He predicted a future where stored data would be analyzed by machines to facilitate better decisions, whether in diagnosing illnesses, educating dyslexic children, or maintaining aircraft engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Focus on Cloud Infrastructure and Database Transformation

[[brad_gerstner_and_altimeter_capitals_success_story | Altimeter]] held a strong conviction that the entire database market would undergo a significant transformation, being "remade in the cloud, purpose built for the cloud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Consequently, a key focus for the firm was the "infrastructure layer in the cloud" and the necessary enablement to bring enterprises into the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This specific area of focus proved to be a "rich vein" for their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

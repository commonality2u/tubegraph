The perspective that "not all software is created equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> has been a prevailing theme over the last decade. This viewpoint extends to the significant transformation observed in the database sector.

## Historical Context of Databases

In 2000, databases constituted the largest sector within software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The aggregate enterprise value of companies primarily deriving revenue from databases reached approximately a trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Future of Data and Decision Making

A profound shift in data generation has occurred, with more data being produced annually than in all previous years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, necessitating a new "home" for this ever-increasing volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Bill Gates once famously articulated a vision for the future, countering the notion that "all the interesting stuff" was already done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He predicted a future where:
> "we will have all this data stored and machines will analyze the data and help us make better decisions about how to diagnose an illness, about how to educate a dyslexic child, about how to maintain an aircraft's engine, it will all be decisions made by machines looking at data." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Transformation to Cloud-Based Databases

There has been a strong conviction that the entire [[evolution_of_databases_since_2000 | database market]] was destined to be remade, specifically within the [[cloud_computing | cloud]] environment and purpose-built for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

This anticipation led to a significant focus on the infrastructure layer within the [[cloud_computing | cloud]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Enabling enterprises to transition to the [[cloud_computing | cloud]] was a primary area of concentration, proving to be a highly successful strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

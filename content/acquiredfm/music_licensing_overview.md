Understanding how [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | music licensing]] works is crucial for comprehending [[the_business_and_rights_dynamics_in_the_music_industry | the music industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

> [!INFO] Purpose of Copyright Law
> The fundamental purpose of copyright law, across all forms of intellectual property like trademarks and patents, is to spur innovation and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This core principle should be kept in mind when evaluating how these laws are applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Different uses of music may require approval from one or both of these copyright holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Sound Recording Copyright (Master)

The first type of copyright is the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | sound recording copyright]], also known as a master recording or "master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This copyright applies to the literal recording of the music as it was captured in the studio and heard by the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

Historically, this copyright is owned by the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Labels traditionally assume ownership of these masters in exchange for taking on the financial risk associated with distributing and promoting an artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This model can be compared to the venture capital industry from the 1970s-90s, where investors took a majority stake in companies for providing initial funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)

The second type of copyright is the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | musical composition copyright]], or the publishing right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This copyright covers the written lyrics and the melody of the song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It represents the "idea" of the song, something that could be put down on sheet music, before it's actually played or recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Traditionally, musical composition copyrights are held by the songwriters themselves, often managed through [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | music publishers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Role of Publishers

[[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | Music publishers]] deal with composition copyrights similarly to how record labels manage masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Historically, publishers would take 50% of the royalties generated from the composition copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, today, their share is often significantly less; larger songwriters might pay a fixed fee for back-office services, effectively owning their musical composition copyrights directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Publishers once held immense power, particularly in the era before recorded music, when publishing rights (like sheet music) were the primary source of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. At that time, artists and recording labels were dependent on publishers who owned the sheet music rights, as singers and songwriters were often different individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Co-Writer Negotiations

Songwriting credits and the associated economics can be split in any way, as they are privately negotiated among co-writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For certain licensing approvals requiring the publishing license, multiple co-writers may need to sign off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Revenue splits can vary wildly, from 50/50 to 90/10, or even a flat fee, depending on the contributions and bargaining power of each songwriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Licensing Mechanics and Economics

When licensing music, whoever owns the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | sound recording master right]] and whoever owns the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | publishing right]] both have a veto right for use cases that require both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The income splits generated from music usage can vary significantly depending on the specific application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### [[economic_splits_and_recoupment_in_music_deals | Economic Splits and Recoupment]]

Compared to publishing deals, where writers might keep 50% of songwriting economics, the splits with [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record labels]] on the master side are historically less favorable for artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. When an artist signs a distribution deal where a record label provides an advance to make an album and then owns the master, the artist's royalty stream is typically 10-15%, potentially reaching 20-22% for very big artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The vast majority of these economics go to the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

A key concept in these deals is [[economic_splits_and_recoupment_in_music_deals | recoupment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Artists only begin to participate in revenues after the upfront advance provided by the label has been recouped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. For example, if a label provides a $500,000 advance, the first $500,000 in generated revenue is kept by the label before the artist receives their percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This system is likened to a VC preference stack on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

This [[the_business_and_rights_dynamics_in_the_music_industry | Byzantine structure]] originated from an era when producing an album and securing distribution and promotion involved significant financial outlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The perceived "predatory" nature of these deals is explained by the high failure rate of new artists; like startups, most artists will not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The [[economic_splits_and_recoupment_in_music_deals | economic splits]] are designed so that the success of winning artists can more than compensate for the financial losses incurred from those who fail, mirroring the model of a venture capital fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This historical context of high upfront investment is what has now "completely changed" in the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

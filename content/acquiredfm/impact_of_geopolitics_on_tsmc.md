Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) operates at the forefront of the global semiconductor industry, yet its strategic importance is intricately linked to complex geopolitical dynamics. The company's unique position as the leading manufacturer of advanced chips means that global stability and international relations directly influence its operations and future.

## TSMC's Strategic Location and Geopolitical Context
TSMC, a company the entire world relies on, is located on an island that some countries consider a sovereign nation, while the People's Republic of China views it as its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This disputed claim introduces a significant geopolitical risk to the company's operations.

The early life of [[morris_changs_leadership_and_decisions_at_tsmc | Morris Chang]], TSMC's founder, was shaped by geopolitical instability, as he lived through three major wars in China before turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. His move to the United States for college in 1949 provided him with a sense of stability that he later valued for its role in fostering innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Government Influence and Support in Taiwan
In the mid-1980s, Taiwan was primarily a manufacturing nation with limited strength in research and development, circuit design, sales, marketing, or intellectual property in the semiconductor sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. The average gross margin for Taiwanese companies at that time was only 4-5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

To elevate its technological standing, the Taiwanese government established the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in the 1970s, envisioning it as Taiwan's equivalent of Bell Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. [[morris_changs_leadership_and_decisions_at_tsmc | KT Lee]], revered as the "father of Taiwan's economic miracle," recruited [[morris_changs_leadership_and_decisions_at_tsmc | Morris Chang]] to lead ITRI in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.

The decision to found TSMC as a pure-play foundry was a strategic move to leverage Taiwan's potential in wafer manufacturing while avoiding weaknesses in other areas of the semiconductor value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>. The government played a direct role in TSMC's creation, with [[morris_changs_leadership_and_decisions_at_tsmc | KT Lee]] pushing [[morris_changs_leadership_and_decisions_at_tsmc | Morris Chang]] to start the company and make it a global leader, an "offer I couldn't refuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. The Taiwanese government initially funded 50% of TSMC's capital, with the premier of Taiwan reportedly strong-arming other business leaders to invest the remaining portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. [[morris_changs_leadership_and_decisions_at_tsmc | Morris Chang]] himself received no equity in the company at its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

## International Relations and Risks
The geopolitical situation poses an "enormous risk" to TSMC, particularly the potential for China to assert its sovereignty over Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a>. Such an event, even without escalating to a world war, could result in China gaining control of TSMC's manufacturing capacity for its own domestic companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:50">[01:59:50]</a>. This would severely impact the global technology sector, as nearly all technological progress relies on semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:32">[02:03:32]</a>.

### Control over Equipment
The production of advanced chips relies on highly specialized machinery, particularly Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines manufactured by ASML, a Dutch company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>. These machines are the only ones capable of making the most cutting-edge semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>. The Netherlands' decision not to renew its trade agreement to sell these machines to China, reportedly due to U.S. prodding, highlights the geopolitical control over critical manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

## Diversification Efforts
In response to increasing geopolitical pressure, TSMC is undertaking some diversification of its manufacturing operations. The company is investing $12 billion to build a plant in Arizona, U.S., though it will not produce its most advanced, leading-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:35">[02:01:35]</a>. This initiative is reportedly subsidized by the U.S. government as part of an effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing onshore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:49">[02:01:49]</a>. TSMC has also announced plans to start a fabrication plant in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:57">[02:01:57]</a>.

Despite these efforts, [[morris_changs_leadership_and_decisions_at_tsmc | Morris Chang]] has expressed that it does not make business sense to have the leading-edge manufacturing in those countries, preferring to maintain it in Taiwan due to the established ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:16">[02:02:16]</a>. The question remains whether the specialized "process power" that TSMC has developed over decades can be easily transferred out of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:53">[02:03:53]</a>. The company's unique moat and long-term defensibility are intertwined with its presence in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:07">[02:20:07]</a>.

Vanta is described as an "awesome company" and a "big supporter of podcasts," recognized as a leader in automated [[security_and_compliance_evolution_in_tech_companies | security and compliance]] software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The company is lauded for its approach to the entire [[security_and_compliance_evolution_in_tech_companies | compliance]] process, including SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The company aims to help businesses achieve [[security_and_compliance_evolution_in_tech_companies | compliance]] certification in weeks rather than months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Vanta Trust Reports

A new product, Vanta Trust Reports, is highlighted as taking [[security_and_compliance_evolution_in_tech_companies | security and compliance]] efforts "even further" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. These reports are designed to help companies strengthen trust and relationships with their customers and partners over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Evolution of the Concept

The concept behind Vanta Trust Reports dates back to the very early days of Vanta, with an initial, "much worse" version launched in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The original idea was to create a report outlining the best [[security_and_compliance_evolution_in_tech_companies | security]] practices, continuously check companies against these practices, and maintain a live, updating, and transparent status page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This was intended to help businesses demonstrate their [[security_and_compliance_evolution_in_tech_companies | security]] and foster growth, while also making them more secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

However, in 2017, the market didn't recognize "Vanta reports," with most companies preferring the established SOC 2 certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The company strategy then shifted to "use the existing standards to bolster yourself and build something better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Benefits of Vanta Trust Reports

The re-launch of Vanta Trust Reports in 2022 is exciting because Vanta is now a recognized entity capable of establishing its own standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. These reports are beneficial for:
*   Companies in the process of obtaining a compliance certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Companies that already have a certification but prefer a continually updated report over a static PDF that becomes outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Unlike a SOC 2 report, which is typically updated annually, a Vanta Trust Report is continuously updated, providing "to the minute" information on a company's practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Vanta currently serves 2,000 to 3,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Public and private equity markets present distinct environments for investors, characterized by differences in information availability, liquidity, and investment approach.

## Information and Liquidity
In public markets, there is an abundance of readily available information, making it challenging to gain a significant advantage over other investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Quantitative data about the present is widely accessible, meaning a knowledge advantage is difficult to achieve by simply massaging current data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

Conversely, private markets are generally much more illiquid compared to public markets, which can offer more advantages to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While [[The concept and challenges of venture capital | venture capital]] is not considered "super inefficient," it is a market where not everyone can easily transact, and gaining access to seemingly great companies can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Despite the difficulty of entry, competition to invest in attractive private companies is fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Investment Approach
The investment approach in private markets, especially [[The concept and challenges of venture capital | venture capital]], tends to be a more probabilistic endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Investors seek extremely high expected value investments where, on average, they might lose their money on individual bets, but a sufficient number of successful investments lead to a great overall return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This contrasts with a focus on avoiding permanent capital loss, which is a core tenet in some traditional investing philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Judgments
[[Investing and venture capital strategies | Venture investing]] often involves making long-term qualitative judgments about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This means identifying significant disparities between current valuations and potential future worth, requiring investors to imagine what a business could look like in 10 years if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This differs significantly from the analysis typically performed by public market investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

To gain a knowledge advantage in markets where current company data is widely available, investors must either:
*   Perform a superior job of massaging current data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   Excel at making qualitative judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Be better at predicting what the future holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

This evolution moves beyond traditional [[Value investing versus growth investing | value investing]] principles, such as "buying dollars for 50 cents," towards dealing with the challenging aspects of qualitative and future-oriented analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Visualizing the Future
Applying traditional [[Market Pricing and Investment Pitfalls | investing lenses]] to [[The concept and challenges of venture capital | venture capital]] involves considering a company's potential worth if successful and the probability of that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This necessitates visualizing the potential financials, competitive moats, capital requirements, likelihood of competition, and future evolution of a business, even in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Some investors are naturally more optimistic, focusing on a company's potential if it succeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Others may find success in identifying undervalued companies, even if their present performance is poor, or predicting a slower decline than generally anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Both approaches can yield significant returns, highlighting the importance of an investor's innate skill set and personality aligning with their chosen investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. For example, some investors are more suited to conservative, quantitative roles like bond investing rather than optimistic, futurist roles in [[Characteristics and appeal of venture capital investing | venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

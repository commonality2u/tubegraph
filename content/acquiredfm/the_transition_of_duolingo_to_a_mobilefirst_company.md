Duolingo's co-founder and CEO, Luis von Ahn, discussed the company's early decision to embrace a mobile-first strategy, a move that proved pivotal for its growth and user engagement.

## Early Considerations and the Shift
When Duolingo began development around 2011, the prevailing trend for technology companies was to prioritize website development, with mobile applications often serving as mere "companion apps" offering limited functionality [00:10:25]. Duolingo initially considered building a website-first platform [00:10:37]. However, within the first few months, the team realized that "almost everything is going mobile" [00:10:39].

This led to a key insight: instead of a companion app, Duolingo could integrate "all the functionality of the website in the app" [00:11:00]. This approach meant creating a fully native mobile experience rather than simply shrinking a website to fit a smaller screen [00:12:18].

## Impact and Design Philosophy
The decision to go mobile-first had an immediate and significant impact:
*   **Rapid Adoption** Upon launching its iPhone app, Duolingo saw mobile traffic surpass website traffic within weeks [00:11:13]. Today, approximately 95% of Duolingo's traffic comes from mobile devices, with only 5% from the web [00:11:21].
*   **Optimized for Mobile** Duolingo consciously designed its app to be a native mobile experience, taking inspiration from well-designed apps like Instagram and Path [00:12:00]. This contrasted with other language learning apps at the time that essentially offered "tiny little website[s]" on mobile [00:11:48]. The focus was on changing design elements to suit the mobile environment, rather than just scaling down existing web content [00:12:12].
*   **Short, Palatable Lessons** A crucial element of Duolingo's mobile design was breaking down lessons into short, digestible chunks, typically around three minutes long [00:04:55]. This allowed users to engage with the app during brief moments, such as "while you're waiting for the bus or while you're literally going to the bathroom" [00:05:09]. Even if users spent 30 minutes on the app, the short "chunks" made it more accessible and less intimidating [00:05:03].

## Market Dynamics
Duolingo's mobile-first strategy allowed it to enter the app market during a period when it "was not yet set in stone" [00:33:15]. This provided a unique opportunity for growth that might not be available today, as the top global apps have become fairly entrenched [00:33:19].

### Monetization on Mobile
The company's approach to monetization on mobile also evolved. Initially, Duolingo made no money from its app [00:18:29]. It wasn't until around 2017 that they started exploring monetization, adopting a freemium model. This model, where users can use the app for free with ads or pay for an ad-free experience, aligns with their mission to provide free education [00:21:00]. The success of this model on mobile-first platforms contributed to their unique position in the education technology sector, moving away from traditional B2B sales to schools [00:59:43]. This success in [[Challenges and Successes in Monetizing Mobile | monetizing mobile]] has been more pronounced in wealthier countries like the U.S., where consumers are more accustomed to paying for digital subscriptions [00:16:46].

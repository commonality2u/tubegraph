Radio City Music Hall has been chosen as the venue for a significant Acquired Live event on July 15th, marking the podcast's 10-year anniversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. The selection of this iconic New York City theater emphasizes a desire for a location that feels both uniquely New York and authentic to the "Acquired cannon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

## Venue Overview

Radio City Music Hall is renowned as the world's largest indoor theater, capable of seating 6,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Its stage is notably three times the width of the one used for the previous Acquired Live event at [[behind_the_scenes_of_acquired_live_at_chase_center | Chase Center]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

The venue holds a storied place in both entertainment and New York City history:
*   **Iconic Status** It is an iconic New York City theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Major Events** It frequently hosts major events, including the Rockettes, the Tony Awards, the Grammys, the MTV VMAs, and the NFL Draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **[[Rockefellers Philanthropy and Legacy | Rockefeller]] Connection** Radio City is a storied part of Rockefeller Center, representing the physical legacy of Standard Oil and John D. Rockefeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Acquired Live Event at Radio City

The decision to host the event at Radio City Music Hall follows the success of last year's event at [[behind_the_scenes_of_acquired_live_at_chase_center | Chase Center]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Despite its large capacity, the demand for tickets is expected to be high due to:
*   Over 6,000 people attending the previous [[behind_the_scenes_of_acquired_live_at_chase_center | Chase Center]] show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   Growth in Acquired's listener base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   New York City being a larger listener base for Acquired than the Bay Area, not including the entire Northeast Corridor (Boston, DC, Philadelphia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Tickets for the event are assigned seats, with a price range kept intentionally narrow (around $100-$120) to ensure accessibility for as many attendees as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Revenue from ticket sales will be directed towards production costs, such as set design and compensating the hundreds of crew members required for the show, rather than generating profit for Acquired or JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This approach aims to celebrate the podcast and its listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is currently at a critical juncture, with companies like Hugging Face positioned at its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Understanding the evolution of AI development is crucial for grasping its current landscape, which encompasses both [[open_source_ai | Open Source AI]] and more closed ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## From Software to AI: A Paradigm Shift

Historically, building technology involved writing millions of lines of code to create products like Facebook or Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Today, the method of technology creation has fundamentally shifted to training models using datasets and building AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This new paradigm is often referred to as "Software 2.0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

This shift is not just replacing previous capabilities, such as building search or social networks with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, but also [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development | unlocking entirely new capabilities]] that were previously impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. AI provides immense leverage for builders, allowing for the rapid creation of rich applications, representing a 10x improvement over previous software paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

## The Hugging Face Story: A Case Study in Evolution

Hugging Face, co-founded by Clem Delong in 2016, started as a chatbot aimed at teenagers, named after the emoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The initial idea was to create an AI Tamagotchi, a conversational AI that would be fun to talk to, and they raised their first two funding rounds based on this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Early investors included Beta Works and the Conway family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The pivotal moment for Hugging Face came in 2017 with the release of the Transformer paper by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. At the time, conversational AI involved stitching together many different models for various tasks like information extraction, intent detection, and emotion understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Recognizing the need for an abstraction layer to manage multiple models and datasets, Hugging Face began building such a platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

A key turning point was when co-founder Thomas ported Google's BERT Transformer model from TensorFlow to PyTorch, which was the more popular language for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This gained significant community attention, leading Hugging Face to double down on developing a platform for models. Initially, it was a single model repository, evolving to include other models like GPT-2 from OpenAI, and eventually expanding to host various models, datasets, and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

This community-driven development, where users requested features like hosting larger models or searchable datasets, led Hugging Face to become a "new GitHub for AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Today, Hugging Face is the leading platform for AI Builders, with over 5 million users sharing more than 3 million models, datasets, and apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A model, dataset, or app is now built on the platform every 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The platform also offers collaboration features for teams to build AI together, including commenting, versioning, and bug reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Openness in AI Development

The debate between open and closed source AI can be misleading because [[open_source_ai | open source]] serves as the foundation for all AI, with even closed-source companies utilizing open research and open source extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. From 2017 to 2019, most AI research was shared publicly, leading to rapid progress and the emergence of Transformers and BERT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. However, in the last two to three years, the field has become less open due to commercial considerations and "misleading arguments" around safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

Some argue that restricting access to AI models is necessary to prevent "bad actors" from misusing the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. However, this argument is seen as misleading, similar to historical fears about books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. The term "artificial intelligence" itself can contribute to public fear and manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

Advocates for openness, like Clem Delong, believe that it will empower thousands of new AI companies, leading to a redistribution of power and a new generation of founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Openness ensures transparency, which is crucial for understanding how AI works and ultimately leads to a safer future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## New Paradigms for AI Startups and [[investment_and_business_models_in_ai | Investment Models]]

Building an AI startup is significantly different from a traditional software startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. A key difference is the heavy capital requirement for compute, especially for foundational models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. While most investment currently goes to large language models (LLMs) for text, there's potential for foundational models across other modalities like video, biology, chemistry, audio, and image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.

The traditional software startup playbook, with its lean startup methodology and focus on small teams, doesn't always apply to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. Many successful AI companies have science co-founders, and the development cycle is often longer, measured in months rather than days, with a focus on creating breakthrough improvements rather than incremental ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

Despite the capital intensity for foundational models, companies using AI can achieve huge outputs with few people by leveraging APIs provided by these larger entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. However, it's also argued that the current reliance on APIs is a transitional phase. Eventually, all tech companies will become AI companies, building and fine-tuning their own models optimized for specific domains and use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. This future envisions a world with almost as many models as code repositories today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>, with smaller, more efficient, and cheaper purpose-built models handling much of the labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

## The Future of AI Builders

There are currently around 5 million AI builders globally, compared to approximately 50 million software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. However, the barrier to entry for becoming an AI builder is lower than for traditional software. While software requires learning a programming language and writing code, an AI builder can contribute expertise or data to improve a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>. This suggests that in the future, there could be 10 times more AI builders than software builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. This broader participation could lead to more inclusive products that address a wider range of social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. AI is seen as "the opportunity of the century" to disrupt established positions and create new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

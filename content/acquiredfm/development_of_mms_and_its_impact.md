M&M's, a globally recognized candy, emerged from a history filled with family drama, strategic business decisions, and innovative marketing. Originally conceived to address a melting chocolate problem, M&M's became a cornerstone of Mars Incorporated's success, influencing both the company's trajectory and the broader confectionery industry.

## The Early Candy Landscape and Chocolate's Ascent

Before chocolate became widely available in America, the candy industry consisted primarily of unbranded "Penny Candy" like gumdrops and licorice, sold regionally and susceptible to spoilage due to lack of refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Frank C. Mars, the founder of what would become Mars Incorporated, initially struggled in this perishable market, facing bankruptcy multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

The introduction of chocolate, particularly milk chocolate, revolutionized the industry. Milton Hershey began selling Hershey's chocolate bars in Pennsylvania in 1900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Hershey learned to process cocoa and later, after studying European methods, developed a way to produce milk chocolate at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. His method, though producing a slightly sour taste, became the defining flavor of chocolate for Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. Hershey's strategy of low pricing and widespread distribution, coupled with the U.S. military sourcing his chocolate for World War I troops, cemented chocolate's place in American culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

The post-World War I era, particularly during Prohibition, saw a boom in "candy bars" as adults sought new "social lubricants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>. Hershey capitalized on this by wholesaling chocolate to numerous candy entrepreneurs, becoming the "AWS of the chocolate business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

## Frank Mars' Success and Forest Mars' Ambition

Frank Mars found success with his fourth candy company in Minneapolis by embracing chocolate, first with buttercream truffles and then with his first "count line" candy bar, the Mar-O-Bar, in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

His estranged son, Forest Mars, a fiercely ambitious individual, re-entered his life in 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>. Forest suggested creating a candy bar inspired by a malted milkshake, leading to the creation of the Milky Way bar in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>. The Milky Way was an undeniable success, and its factory production made it a significant player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. This was followed by the Snickers bar in 1930, named after Frank's favorite horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>, and the Three Musketeers bar in 1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>. These products thrived even during the Great Depression, demonstrating the resilience of the candy business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.

Forest, however, yearned for greater control and global expansion, clashing with his father's contentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. In 1932, Forest left his father's company, receiving $50,000 and the international rights to the Milky Way recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.

## Forest Mars' Global Ventures and the Birth of M&M's

Forest moved to Europe, where he literally worked as a factory line worker at chocolate companies like Jean Tobler and Nestle to learn the intricacies of chocolate production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. In 1933, he opened a factory in Slough, England, using his acquired knowledge and the Milky Way recipe to create the Mars Bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. The Mars Bar quickly became a hit, making Mars UK the third-largest candy company in Britain by 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>. He also shrewdly diversified into the nascent pet food industry, acquiring Chappies dog food in 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>.

Forest's strategic vision led to the establishment of Mars' Five Principles:
*   **Quality:** Obsession with quality, even leading to implementing a "Toyota production system" where any employee could stop the line for defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. This also implied "value for money," providing high quality at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.
*   **Responsibility:** Paying employees significantly more than industry average (three to four times initially), tying pay to company performance, and having no executive perks like private offices or parking spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>.
*   **Mutuality:** Ensuring that all partners in the ecosystem—retailers, suppliers, distributors—also profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** Focusing on "Return on Total Assets" (ROTA) as the primary metric, with a target of an 18% return, pushing for constant reinvestment and operational improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>. Mars' factories achieved incredible efficiency, producing over 5,500 fun-size Milky Way bars per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:22">[02:32:22]</a>.
*   **Freedom:** Maintaining private family ownership, avoiding public markets and debt, which allowed for long-term investment decisions and a highly private company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>.

In 1939, Forest returned to America, seeking to re-establish his presence in the U.S. market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:55">[01:46:55]</a>. He approached William Murray, the president of Hershey, with a radical idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Forest had observed "Dragee" candies in the Spanish Civil War, small, candy-coated chocolates that wouldn't melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>. He proposed a joint venture to produce these, leveraging Hershey's chocolate supply and Murray's access to military contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:01">[01:58:01]</a>. The deal resulted in the creation of M&M Limited as an 80/20 partnership between Forest and Murray's son, Bruce Murray, in 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:30">[01:57:30]</a>.

## M&M's in World War II and Post-War Dominance

The timing was crucial: the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, leading to chocolate rationing for consumers but massive demand from the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:42">[02:01:42]</a>. Hershey, the exclusive supplier to the military, limited chocolate supply to other candy companies but ensured M&M's received a steady flow due to the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:02:04]</a>. M&M's became a staple ration for the Air Force and Army, proving its non-melting advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:48">[02:02:48]</a>. During this period, Forest also founded a fourth business in the U.S., leveraging a new method for parboiling rice to create Uncle Ben's Rice for military consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:19">[02:07:19]</a>.

After the war, M&M's needed a consumer launch, but initial sales were tepid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:10">[02:09:10]</a>. Forest's relentless pressure, including publicly shaming Bruce Murray for low sales, ultimately led to Forest buying out Bruce's 20% stake in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

Forest then hired Ted Bates and Company in 1950 to conduct a comprehensive market study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:42">[02:12:42]</a>. They discovered that while adults were the primary candy buyers, kids loved M&M's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>. This insight led to one of the most famous advertising slogans of all time: "The milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:54">[02:15:54]</a>. This message brilliantly appealed to parents, addressing the concern of messy chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:49">[02:16:49]</a>. Coupled with sponsorships on popular children's TV shows like The Mickey Mouse Club, M&M's exploded in popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:22">[02:17:22]</a>. By 1956, M&M's became the biggest-selling candy in America, surpassing even the Hershey's bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:45">[02:17:45]</a>.

To combat copycats, the iconic "M" was first printed in black on each candy in 1950, transitioning to white in 1954, accompanied by a campaign encouraging consumers to "look for the M on every piece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:07">[02:18:07]</a>.

### Key Moments in M&M's Marketing and Brand Building

*   **1980s *E.T.* Missed Opportunity:** Mars declined to feature M&M's in the film *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* due to a required $1 million co-marketing commitment, allowing rival Hershey's Reese's Pieces to be featured instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:05">[02:33:05]</a>. This decision inadvertently boosted Reese's Pieces' sales threefold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:39">[02:34:39]</a>.
*   **1995 "Vote for Blue" Campaign:** Mars replaced the tan M&M with blue after a public vote, a brilliant marketing stunt that generated millions of calls and significant media attention, showcasing their understanding of consumer engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:37">[02:28:37]</a>. This demonstrated how a brand could leverage consumer participation for marketing and brand loyalty.
*   **Enduring Characters:** The animated M&M's characters, first introduced in TV commercials in 1954, have evolved but remain a consistent and witty part of the brand's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:54">[02:18:54]</a>. Mars was early to adopt computer-generated 3D modeling for these characters, using it by 1994, just one year after *Jurassic Park* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:50">[03:27:50]</a>.
*   **Strategic Partnerships:** M&M's and other Mars brands have consistently partnered with major entities like the Olympics, the NFL, and NASA, associating themselves with loved, universal brands to enhance their own appeal and nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:48">[02:55:48]</a>.

## Impact on Mars and the Confectionery Industry

M&M's success was instrumental in Forest Mars' eventual acquisition of his father's company, Mars Incorporated (Chicago Mars), in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:49">[02:28:49]</a>. This marked the unification of Forest's diverse global businesses under the Mars Inc. umbrella. Forest then focused on making Mars self-sufficient in chocolate production, ending their reliance on Hershey and controlling the entire production process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:56">[02:31:56]</a>.

Mars' strategic response to Hershey's ill-received price hike in 1969 — by increasing advertising and maintaining or even increasing bar sizes while keeping prices stable — allowed Mars to surpass Hershey as the number one candy company in America by 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>. M&M's, with its strong brand and lower cost of goods due to its candy shell and various ingredients, was a key weapon in this "price and size war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:06">[02:46:06]</a>.

M&M's also benefited from, and contributed to, a fundamental shift in retail: Mars pioneered the lobbying of merchants to place candy displays near cash registers, turning candy into a ubiquitous impulse purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:50">[02:34:50]</a>.

Today, M&M's remain a global icon, representing Mars' prowess in branding, distribution, and leveraging scale economies. The enduring success of M&M's highlights the power of understanding consumer psychology, consistent marketing, and disciplined operational efficiency in building a lasting brand. While candy remains a significant part of Mars' revenue, their diversification into pet care has made it an even larger segment of their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:02">[03:14:02]</a>.

Epic Systems is a privately held company based in rural Wisconsin that plays an enormous role in US healthcare, notably through its patient software, MyChart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. The company is unusual in many ways: it does no marketing or significant sales, often declines potential customers, does not negotiate or discount, has never raised venture capital, and has made no acquisitions in its 47 years of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. All employees work in-person at its vast campus designed with whimsical themes like the Land of Oz and Grand Central Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Epic holds the majority market share of major US hospital systems and has almost never lost a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. As of 2024, Epic had $5.7 billion in revenue and over 14,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Founding and Early Years

[[Judith Faulkner and Epics founding | Judith Faulkner]], born Judy Greenfield in Earlton, New Jersey in August 1943, is the company's founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Her father was a small-town entrepreneur running a pharmacy, and her mother, Dell Greenfield, was a peace advocate whose organization, Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

[[Judith Faulkner and Epics founding | Faulkner]] developed an early interest in math and learned Fortran programming at the University of Rochester's particle physics lab in the mid-1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. She later chose to pursue a PhD in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she encountered the emerging field of computers in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. While working part-time for the Wisconsin Medical School, [[Judith Faulkner and Epics founding | Faulkner]] recognized the need for a single database to keep longitudinal records on patients across different departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

This led to her epiphany in the mid-1970s, where she conceived of "Chronicles," an integrated database system that remains the core of Epic's software today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:48:00">[33:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>. Initially, Chronicles was a database with text-only terminal access, used only by technical personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:57:00">[35:57:00]</a>. Due to viral demand from other institutions, [[Judith Faulkner and Epics founding | Faulkner]] reluctantly founded Human Services Computing in 1979, which later became Epic Systems in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>. The company's initial funding amounted to only $70,000 in equity and a $70,000 bank loan for a mini-computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:35:00">[41:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44:00">[41:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:05:00">[42:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>.

## Product Evolution and [[the_evolution_and_challenges_of_enterprise_software_systems | The Evolution and Challenges of Enterprise Software Systems]]

Early efforts to standardize medical records in the US date back to 1912, but they remained paper-based and informal for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>. The advent of computers in the 1960s and the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 spurred the need for standardized electronic records to facilitate billing with third-party payers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:52:00">[28:52:00]</a>.

The first real computerized medical record system, Co-Star, was developed at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1966, utilizing a new programming language called Mumps (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:16:00">[30:16:00]</a>. Epic still uses Mumps' modern descendant, Cache, for its integrated database system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>.

In 1987, Epic launched Resolute, its billing module, which became critical for hospitals to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:43:00">[53:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:52:00">[53:52:00]</a>. The shift to the PC era allowed for wider adoption, leading to the launch of Epicare in 1992, the first graphical user interface (GUI) EMR application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:32:00">[57:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:47:00">[57:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:18:00">[58:18:00]</a>. This integrated scheduling (Cadence), billing (Resolute), and clinical (Epicare) functionalities for ambulatory settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:00">[58:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:23:00">[59:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The inpatient version of Epicare launched in 2001, providing a comprehensive solution for hospital stays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

Epic's core strength, a key component of its [[epics_competitive_edge_and_business_model | competitive edge]], lies in its single, integrated database (Chronicles) that all applications pull from, ensuring reliability and seamless data flow between clinical and billing functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[35:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:07:00">[54:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:22:00">[54:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:05:00">[55:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:11:00">[55:11:00]</a>.

## Business Model and Culture

Epic's unique [[epics_competitive_edge_and_business_model | business model]] is characterized by its rural Wisconsin campus on a farm, designed to attract talent from across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. The campus, inspired by Microsoft's Redmond campus, is 1,700 acres with 89 buildings, including the world's largest subsurface auditorium, Deep Space, with 11,400 seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This whimsical environment, coupled with a hard-driving performance-oriented culture, defines the company's DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:06">[01:38:06]</a>.

[[Judith Faulkner and Epics founding | Faulkner]] views Epic as a "software factory" that turns developers into medical code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The company operates by a set of ten commandments, displayed in every bathroom and break room on campus, emphasizing principles like "do not go public," "do not acquire or be acquired," "software must work," "reality equals expectations," and "be frugal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. These commandments also serve as a public declaration to customers about Epic's unchanging business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Epic's [[enterprise_software_sales_strategies | sales strategies]] are unique, as it has no dedicated sales or marketing department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Its roughly eight "salespeople" only respond to inbound requests and typically come from project management or technical specialist roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:34">[01:53:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:41">[01:53:41]</a>. The company focuses heavily on customer success and has a "Best Friend Forever" (BFF) system, where each customer has a dedicated Epic employee to ensure their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:22">[01:54:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>. Epic even grades its customers annually on their usage of Epic tools, benchmarking them against peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:35">[01:54:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">[01:55:02]</a>.

Hiring at Epic is rigorous, often recruiting smart, young college graduates who undergo intensive six-month training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:11">[01:50:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Developers are expected to fix their own bugs promptly to maintain a "zero-bug environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:18">[01:46:18]</a>. The company operates with few middle managers and a flat structure, enabling direct engagement between junior and senior staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:13">[01:44:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:18">[01:44:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:23">[01:44:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>. All employees, including software developers, participate in immersion trips to clinical settings to observe workflows firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>.

## Market Dominance and [[healthcare_industry_challenges_and_Epics_role | Epic's Role in Healthcare Challenges]]

Epic's growth was significantly impacted by the Kaiser Permanente deal in 2003, which transformed Epic from a $50 million company to one with $162 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Kaiser, the largest hospital system at the time, chose Epic after a failed IBM implementation and despite Epic's smaller size compared to rival Cerner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Epic's refusal to compromise on its integrated system architecture or offer equity, unlike Cerner, solidified its position as a trusted and reliable vendor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>.

The Bush administration's 2006 State of the Union address highlighted the need for electronic medical records to control costs and reduce errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:37">[02:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:53">[02:03:53]</a>. This bipartisan push culminated in the HITECH Act of 2009, part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which allocated $36 billion in incentives for hospitals to adopt and meaningfully use EHR systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:50">[02:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:12">[02:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:12">[02:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. This legislation accelerated EHR penetration from 9% of hospitals in 2009 to 95% by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:27">[02:19:27]</a>. While digitizing healthcare records, it also increased administrative burden for doctors and incentivized upcoding, potentially contributing to rising [[healthcare_industry_challenges_and_Epics_role | healthcare industry challenges and Epic's role]] costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:25">[02:24:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:06">[02:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:11">[02:25:11]</a>.

Epic, as the most reliable vendor, benefited significantly from these incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:16">[02:18:16]</a>. Meanwhile, competitors like Cerner engaged in numerous acquisitions, consolidating 36 companies, which led to integration challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:50">[02:21:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:11">[02:35:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:28">[02:35:28]</a>. The Department of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Administration (VA) contracts, worth $4.3 billion and $10 billion respectively, were awarded to Cerner, but both projects faced massive delays and budget overruns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:02">[02:39:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:52">[02:39:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:50">[02:40:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:50">[02:41:50]</a>. Cerner's eventual acquisition by Oracle for $28 billion in 2021, and its subsequent struggles, further validated Epic's strategy of organic growth and private ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:11">[02:47:11]</a>.

## Current State and [[future_prospects_and_criticisms_of_Epic | Future Prospects]]

Epic currently serves 607 health systems, encompassing 3,200 hospitals, 590,000 physicians, and 495,000 staffed beds, covering 325 million patients worldwide, with 280 million in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:36">[03:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:40">[03:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. MyChart alone has 191 million active users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. Epic's revenue was $5.7 billion in 2024, with estimated EBITDA margins between 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:17">[03:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:42">[03:04:42]</a>.

A significant [[epics_competitive_edge_and_business_model | competitive edge]] for Epic is "Care Everywhere," which allows for the seamless exchange of patient records between Epic-using hospitals, with 20 million records exchanged daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a>. This feature was made mandatory for all Epic customers by [[Judith Faulkner and Epics founding | Faulkner]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:08">[02:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:49">[02:09:49]</a>.

### Cosmos and AI Integration
Epic launched Cosmos, a de-identified database containing data from 295 million patients and 15 billion patient encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:04">[02:56:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:48">[02:56:48]</a>. This platform allows contributing institutions free access to query data for research, identify "lookalike" patients for rare conditions, and gain insights into patient outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:07">[02:59:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:40">[02:59:40]</a>.

Cosmos is a significant step towards realizing the utopian dream of using digitized healthcare data for broader insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:03">[02:58:03]</a>. The integration of AI, particularly ambient listening AI scribes from partners like Nuance, Abridge, and Suki, promises to reduce physician burnout by automating note-taking and administrative tasks, allowing doctors to focus more on patient care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:08">[03:38:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:20">[03:39:20]</a>. This represents a major [[future_prospects_and_criticisms_of_Epic | future prospect]] and revenue opportunity for Epic.

## [[Judith Faulkner and Epics founding | Leadership and Succession]]

At 81, [[Judith Faulkner and Epics founding | Faulkner]] has established a robust succession plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. She owns approximately half of Epic economically and 100% of the voting shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Her non-voting shares are being transferred to her foundation, Broots and Wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:31">[03:09:31]</a>. Upon her death, all voting shares will transfer into a "purpose trust" managed by her family, five long-time Epic senior managers, and three customer CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:51">[03:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:13">[03:10:13]</a>. The trust's bylaws stipulate that the company can never be sold or taken public, and the next CEO must be a long-time Epic employee and a software developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:33">[03:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:42">[03:10:42]</a>.

## [[epics_competitive_edge_and_business_model | Competitive Edge and Business Model]]

Epic's enduring [[epics_competitive_edge_and_business_model | competitive edge]] stems from several factors:
*   **Switching Costs**: Epic's systems are deeply integrated as the "nervous system" of hospitals, making switching extremely costly and disruptive, often involving hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in opportunity costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:25">[03:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:37">[03:14:37]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies**: The company's large customer base allows it to amortize massive R&D investments (35% of operating expenses) across many clients, enabling continuous development of new products and features, which are often bundled for existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:20">[03:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:42">[03:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:51">[03:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:19">[03:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:41">[03:20:41]</a>.
*   **Network Economies**: As more hospitals adopt Epic, it becomes increasingly attractive for others due to the ability to easily share records (Care Everywhere) and the prevalence of Epic-trained physicians graduating from academic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:07">[03:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:59">[03:16:59]</a>. 90% of medical school students now train on Epic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:28">[02:46:28]</a>.
*   **Branding**: Epic is the most trusted vendor among prestigious institutions, leading to a "no one gets fired for buying Epic" reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:48">[03:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:55">[03:17:55]</a>.
*   **Process Power**: Its unique software development methodology, based on the Mumps/Cache language, creates a specialized skillset among its developers, contributing to a "zero-bug" environment crucial for healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:21">[03:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:05">[03:19:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:51">[03:19:51]</a>.
*   **[[power_dynamics_in_technology_companies | Power Dynamics in Technology Companies]]**: Epic is highly opinionated about its implementations, pushing for standard configurations, and is not afraid to say "no" to potential customers, which reinforces its [[power_dynamics_in_technology_companies | power dynamics]] and long-term control over its product ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:40">[01:55:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>.
*   **Litigation Strategy**: Epic is aggressive in defending its intellectual property and employment practices, including enforcing non-competes and winning landmark cases on forced arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:04">[03:24:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:18">[03:24:18]</a>. Notably, it has never been in a lawsuit or mediation with a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:13">[03:25:13]</a>.

## [[future_prospects_and_criticisms_of_Epic | Future Prospects and Criticisms]]

Epic's [[future_prospects_and_criticisms_of_Epic | future prospects]] include continued international expansion, leveraging its dominance to build products for payers (insurance companies), biotech, and pharmaceutical companies, and integrating AI to reduce administrative burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:30">[03:55:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. The consolidation of hospital systems, partly driven by increased compliance burdens from acts like the Affordable Care Act, also benefits Epic, as larger systems are their target market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:56">[03:50:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:06">[03:51:06]</a>.

However, Epic faces [[future_prospects_and_criticisms_of_Epic | criticisms]] regarding interoperability with non-Epic systems and concerns about its perceived anti-competitive practices, such as an ongoing antitrust lawsuit involving Particle Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:28">[02:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:46">[03:24:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:01">[03:25:01]</a>. Despite the Cures Act aiming to prevent "information blocking," Epic's tight control over its data remains a point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:11">[03:32:11]</a>. Yet, the company maintains that its strict data management policies are crucial for patient privacy and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:14">[02:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:18">[02:08:18]</a>.

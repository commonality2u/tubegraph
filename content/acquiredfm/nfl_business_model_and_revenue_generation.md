From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The National Football League (NFL) is America's favorite sport, significantly more popular than basketball, its closest competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The Super Bowl alone garners over 100 million viewers annually, reaching approximately two-thirds of American households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. In a recent year, 82 of the top 100 TV broadcasts were NFL games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This dominance is a result of a century of strategic cooperation, a "communist capitalism" approach, and bold, long-term bets by NFL owners to equally divide revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Origins and Early Challenges

American football originated from "mob football" or "medieval football" in England, where the goal was simply to move a ball to a certain spot, with no rules and potentially violent outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. American college students began to codify the game, seeing it as an integral part of the college experience and a character-building activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. However, it remained extremely dangerous, leading to 19 fatalities in intercollegiate football in 1905 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. President Theodore Roosevelt intervened, threatening to outlaw the game unless major safety changes were adopted, which led to the creation of the NCAA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. A key rule change that differentiated American football was the legalization of the forward pass in 1905, introducing a strategic and beautiful element to the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

Professional football teams began to emerge in the early 1900s, but they were viewed as second-rate and even immoral compared to the amateur college game, which was considered a sacred rite of passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Baseball, by contrast, was already the undisputed national pastime and a successful professional sport with a [[business_models_in_gaming | business model]] based on selling admission to games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

### Founding of the NFL (1920)

In 1920, the American Professional Football Conference (soon to be the NFL) was formed in Canton, Ohio, by heads of barnstorming professional teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Their goal was to legitimize professional football. Their three-part plan included:
1.  **Strict demarcation from college football:** No current college players were to be signed, a rule that largely holds true today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
2.  **High ethical and rules-based standard:** To unify different rulebooks and set fan expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
3.  **Appointing Jim Thorpe as president:** Thorpe, widely considered the greatest athlete of his time, provided instant legitimacy to the league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

Despite this, the NFL faced an uphill battle in the 1920s and 1930s due to lingering stigma from the college game, and most teams, often based in small towns, were financially unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Only three original franchises endured: the Decatur Staleys (who became the Chicago Bears), the Racine Cardinals (now Arizona Cardinals), and the Green Bay Packers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. The league also saw a racial ban in the mid-1930s, kicking black players out until after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

## Post-World War II Transformation

After WWII, the return of troops, the GI Bill, and the rise of a new middle class with disposable income created a demand for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. Previously, team ownership was about subsidizing losses; now, a business opportunity emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

### Competition and Evolution

The NFL's hand was forced by competition:
*   **All-America Football Conference (AAFC):** Formed in 1944, the AAFC included powerful ownership groups and secured the legendary coach Paul Brown, who would coach the Cleveland Browns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. The Browns were so dominant they won all four AAFC championships, making games boring and hurting attendance, teaching the NFL a crucial lesson about the need for competitive balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   **Commissioner Bert Bell:** Installed in 1946, Bell emphasized a "league-first" mentality, striving for competitive balance where "on any given Sunday any team in the league should be able to beat any other team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. This led to structural changes:
    *   **Overhauled Scheduling:** Weaker teams played other weaker teams in the first half of the season, and stronger teams played stronger teams, aiming for a 50/50 record midpoint for all teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
    *   **Reverse Order Draft:** The NFL instituted a draft of college players, with the worst team from the previous season getting the first picks, ensuring talent distribution and maintaining competitive balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>.
    *   **Shared Ticket Revenue:** Initially, 40% of home game ticket revenue went to the visiting team, which later evolved into a shared pool for all teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>. This was critical as ticket sales were the primary revenue source until 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

The AAFC eventually folded in 1949, with only three teams (Browns, 49ers, Colts) joining the NFL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

### [[impact_of_television_on_nfl_growth | Impact of Television on NFL Growth]]

The early 1950s saw an explosion in television set sales, with 25 million homes having TVs by the early 50s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. While baseball owners initially resisted TV due to fears of cannibalizing ticket sales, the NFL, as an underdog sport, was more willing to experiment with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. Early individual TV deals often included local blackouts of home games to protect gate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. By the end of the 1950s, the league's TV revenue exceeded $1 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

The 1958 NFL Championship game between the Giants and Colts, dubbed "the greatest game ever played," drew 45 million TV viewers, demonstrating the massive potential of professional football on television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

### The American Football League (AFL) Challenge

In 1959, Lamar Hunt, an oil heir, founded the American Football League (AFL) after being rebuffed by the NFL for an expansion team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>. The AFL adopted a radical strategy:
*   **Centralized National TV Contract:** Borrowing from a discarded baseball idea, the AFL centrally negotiated one national TV contract for the entire league, splitting revenue equally among all teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. This was a direct challenge to the NFL's individual team deals.
*   **Partnership with ABC:** While major networks were skeptical, ABC, a relatively upstart network without a sports division, signed a five-year, $8.5 million deal with the AFL, the largest sports rights TV deal in history at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This secured $1.3 million per year for the AFL before it even played a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.

### Pete Rozelle's Leadership

In 1960, after Bert Bell's sudden death, the NFL installed 33-year-old Pete Rozelle as commissioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. Rozelle, with a public relations background, was a visionary who reshaped the NFL:
*   **Expansion:** He immediately ratified an expansion plan to compete directly with the AFL in key markets like Dallas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.
*   **Headquarters Relocation:** Moved NFL headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City to be closer to the media, advertising, and television industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>.
*   **Professional Statistics:** Contracted Elias Sports Bureau to provide professional statistics, making it easier for newspapers to cover the league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   **Narrative Cultivation:** Intentionally cultivated relationships with publications like Sports Illustrated to create human stories, arcs, and mythology around the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>. NFL staff even wrote stories for reporters to control the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>.
*   **Political Influence:** Cultivated relationships with the Kennedy family, leading to the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, which granted the NFL an antitrust exemption to negotiate league-wide TV contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>. This allowed the NFL to sign a two-year, $4.65 million per year deal with CBS, tripling the AFL's deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.
*   **NFL Films:** In 1965, Rozelle supported the creation of NFL Films, an in-house division that revolutionized sports video content by producing high-quality, cinematic films of games with montages, slow motion, and voice-overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. This was not for profit but to elevate the league's stature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   **NFL Enterprises:** Centralized and standardized all league-wide merchandise under NFL Enterprises, deepening fan engagement and ensuring a consistent quality experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

These initiatives formed the "flywheel" of the NFL: raising the league's stature attracted deeper fan interest, which increased TV dollars, which were shared evenly among teams, raising the level of play, improving the product, and further driving fan interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:41">[01:32:41]</a>. This strategy, "league first, team second," laid the groundwork for the NFL's massive revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.

### AFL-NFL Merger and the Super Bowl

The competition between the NFL and AFL escalated into a "war," particularly for college superstar rookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>. After strategic maneuvers and a "mafia movie"-like negotiation involving NFL GM Tex Schramm and AFL founder Lamar Hunt, a merger agreement was announced in June 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:06">[01:58:06]</a>. This true merger brought all AFL teams into the NFL, with a promise to expand to 28 teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:17">[01:58:17]</a>.

A key part of the merger was the creation of a "Pro Football World Championship game" between the winners of the two leagues, starting in the 1966 season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>. This event, later named the Super Bowl (coined by Lamar Hunt), was an unprecedented television event, attracting 65 million live viewers for Super Bowl I in 1967, even though the stadium wasn't sold out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:05">[02:09:05]</a>.

The Super Bowl became a meticulously crafted media event:
*   **Media Week:** A deliberate invention to generate hype, including the Commissioner's press conference to shift pressure from players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:28">[02:10:28]</a>.
*   **Partner Events:** Parties, concerts, and events were hosted for TV partners, advertisers, and the press to add "gloss and sheen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>.
*   **Narrative Building:** Super Bowl III, with Joe Namath's "guarantee" of an AFL victory over the favored Colts, created immense drama and solidified the idea that football was compelling entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:40">[02:13:40]</a>.

### Monday Night Football (1970)

The NFL, under Rozelle, continued to innovate. In 1970, with the combined league, they identified a new opportunity: prime-time football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:52">[02:17:52]</a>. ABC, again seeing the potential, secured exclusive rights to Monday Night Football for $8.5 million per season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:38">[02:23:38]</a>. This was a significant amount for a single weekly game compared to the much larger Sunday packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>.

Monday Night Football revolutionized sports broadcasting:
*   **"Show Business" Approach:** Covered games "like show business," with field-level cameras, sideline cameras, and multiple angles (up to 17 cameras) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Commentary:** Introduced a three-man booth with action-oriented commentary, famously featuring Howard Cosell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:13">[02:27:13]</a>.
*   **Technological Innovations:** Pioneered parabolic microphones, split screens, and on-field interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:18">[02:28:18]</a>.
*   **Highlights:** Leveraging NFL Films, Monday Night Football was the first to show highlights of previous day's games at halftime, a precursor to ESPN's SportsCenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:06">[02:30:06]</a>. The theme song was also a new concept for sports broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:50">[02:29:50]</a>.

The first Monday Night Football game was watched by 60 million U.S. households, effectively creating a weekly holiday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>.

## Modern NFL Business and Revenue Generation

By the 1970s, the NFL had eclipsed baseball as America's favorite sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:36">[02:19:36]</a>. In 1973, President Nixon, tired of blackouts, compelled Congress to pass legislation forcing the NFL to air local home games if they were sold out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, a move that further boosted TV distribution.

### Revenue Streams

The NFL's revenue streams today are diverse and significant:
*   **Media Rights:** The largest component. The current 10-year deal signed in 2022 is worth $112 billion across various networks.
    *   CBS: Sunday afternoon package ($1.85 billion/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:43">[02:47:43]</a>
    *   FOX: Sunday afternoon package ($2 billion/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:50">[02:47:50]</a>
    *   NBC: Sunday Night Football ($1.7 billion/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:55">[02:47:55]</a>
    *   Disney (ESPN): Monday Night Football ($2.55 billion/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:04">[02:48:04]</a>
    *   Amazon: Thursday Night Football (exclusive, $1.3 billion/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:12">[02:48:12]</a>
    *   YouTube TV: NFL Sunday Ticket (exclusive, ~$2 billion/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:21">[02:48:21]</a>. This re-sells content already produced by other networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:29">[02:48:29]</a>.
*   **Ticketing/Gate Revenue:** While once dominant, it now accounts for about 10% of total revenue for general seating and another 10% for premium seating/suites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:22">[02:54:22]</a>.
*   **Sponsorship and Advertising:** Accounts for around 10% of total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:48">[02:54:48]</a>.
*   **Licensing:** Includes significant deals like the Madden NFL video game series with EA, a five-year, $1.6 billion deal ($300 million/year), with a portion going to players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:25">[02:49:25]</a>. NFL Films also generates revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:16">[02:49:16]</a>.
*   **Fantasy Football & Sports Betting:** While not directly generating significant revenue for the NFL yet, these activities deeply engage fans. Millions play fantasy football, driving viewership and conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:45">[02:50:45]</a>. Legalized sports betting (now in many states) also significantly boosts engagement, with 46 million Americans betting on the NFL in a recent year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:46">[02:51:46]</a>.

Overall, 61% of NFL team revenue comes from media, 20% from seating, 10% from sponsorship/advertising, and 9% from other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:11">[02:54:11]</a>. On average, two-thirds of a team's revenue comes from shared national revenue, and one-third from local revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:06">[02:53:06]</a>. However, this varies greatly; the Dallas Cowboys made over $1 billion last year, while the Detroit Lions made $450 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:40">[02:53:40]</a>.

### Player Compensation and Salary Cap

In 1993, the NFL introduced free agency for players (after four years in the league) along with a salary cap, fixing player compensation at a percentage of league revenue (currently 48.8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:26">[02:43:26]</a>. This ensures players are partners in the league's success, even as local revenue from stadiums and sponsorships (which is not shared) grows as a percentage of overall team revenue, from 12% in 1994 to over 30% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. The salary cap helps maintain competitive balance by ensuring even teams with lower local revenue can afford quality players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

The NFL faces several [[Controversies and challenges facing the NFL | controversies and challenges]]:
*   **Player Safety (CTE):** The link between football and CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), a devastating brain condition from repeated head hits, became clear in the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:16">[02:55:16]</a>. The NFL settled a billion-dollar lawsuit and was criticized for covering up data on long-term damage until 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:41">[02:56:41]</a>. This has led to declining youth football participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:03">[02:58:03]</a> and concerns about the game's perception among future generations (e.g., Gen Z shows less interest than older demographics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:40">[02:58:40]</a>.
*   **[[Platform business models and strategies | Control of Narrative]]:** The NFL's long-standing "command and control" approach to media and player voices, exemplified by the handling of Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest in 2016, clashed with the social media era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Unlike the NBA, which embraced players' social media platforms, the NFL's strategy to suppress individual voices backfired, amplifying the controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:12">[03:06:12]</a>.
*   **International Expansion:** The NFL has struggled to gain significant international interest despite efforts like NFL Europe and "home marketing agreements" allowing teams to market in specific countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:18">[03:10:18]</a>. This contrasts with the NBA, whose global popularity is a key growth driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:52">[03:10:52]</a>.
*   **Audience Stagnation:** While media rights values continue to soar, average viewership for NFL games has largely stagnated over the last two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:09">[03:16:09]</a>. This suggests that the rising media rights value is driven more by the scarcity of live, mass-reach content and networks' desperation for it, rather than audience growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:02">[03:17:02]</a>.
*   **College Football Landscape:** College football, which has historically served as a free development system and storyline generator for the NFL, is seeing its top players begin to earn significant money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:36">[03:13:36]</a>. While the NFL is not yet directly competing for these players, the changing landscape could alter the long-term feeder system.

Despite these challenges, the NFL remains an economic powerhouse, often described as the largest single media business in the world, with current annual revenues of $18 billion projected to grow to $25 billion by 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:17">[02:47:17]</a>. Team valuations have also ballooned, from an average of $1.2 billion in 2012 to $4.5 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:41">[03:24:41]</a>, driven by scarcity and desirability rather than pure economic cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:12">[03:25:12]</a>. The league's ability to outsource distribution and production to its broadcast partners, while retaining content rights and profiting from reselling them multiple times (e.g., Sunday Ticket), is a key strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:58">[03:19:58]</a>. The NFL's continued success is often attributed to the "Lindy effect," suggesting its long history and established cultural role indicate future longevity and dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

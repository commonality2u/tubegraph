## TSMC's Strategic Approach and Scale Economies
[[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] adopts a strategy of potentially sacrificing current profits for anticipated future revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This approach aims to secure future earnings through customer loyalty or the acquisition of new clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This strategy is closely linked to [[unusual_scale_economies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | unusual scale economies]] present in the [[challenges_and_successes_within_the_semiconductor_market | semiconductor market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Unique Characteristics of the Semiconductor Industry
The [[development_and_impact_of_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor industry]] exhibits several distinct characteristics:
*   **High Capital Investment** New fabrication facilities (fabs) require exceptionally large, lumpy capital investments, often exceeding $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Predictable Performance Advances** Unlike many other industries, the [[development_and_impact_of_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor industry]] benefits from relatively predictable material performance advancements, exemplified by Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This allows companies to have a high assurance of achieving significant improvements (e.g., a 10x improvement in 18 months) by making the correct technology choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This level of predictability is highly unusual in most business environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Role of Upstream Suppliers
A significant aspect of [[the_technological_ecosystem_in_the_semiconductor_industry | the semiconductor ecosystem]] is that technological advantages are primarily driven by upstream suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Companies like ASML are critical in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Decisions regarding technology pathways can be challenging; historically, [[development_and_impact_of_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor]] companies faced extensive discussions and significant investment debates, such as the choice to pursue x-ray lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

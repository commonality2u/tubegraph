Erwin Mark Jacobs, an American born in 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> in New Bedford, Massachusetts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, is renowned as a pioneer in the wireless and communications industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Early Life and Aptitude

Jacobs grew up in a very middle-class family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> in New Bedford, a city that was no longer the wealthy whaling center it once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. His father worked multiple jobs and eventually ran a local restaurant called the Boston Beef Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. From a young age, Jacobs demonstrated exceptional talent in math and sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, aspiring to study these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

However, his high school guidance counselor famously advised him that there was "no future for Math and Science in New Bedford" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Given his excellent grades, the counselor encouraged him to attend the Cornell School of Hotel Management to learn hospitality management and return to work in the family business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## An Unlikely Educational Path

Jacobs initially followed this advice, enrolling at the Cornell School of Hotel Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He spent a year and a half in the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, where he learned about business accounting and real-world applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. He later credited this period with significantly helping him transition out of academia and become an entrepreneur, particularly in starting his first company, Linkabit, and later, Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. He found that he "loved that too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

After this initial experience, Jacobs discovered that engineering offered a way to "make money with math and science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> and was "in demand" elsewhere in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He approached the dean at Cornell to request a transfer from hotel management to electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The dean was reportedly surprised, asking if he meant the reverse, but Jacobs insisted on pursuing the "hard stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The transfer was eventually permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Academic and Professional Milestones

Jacobs's aptitude for electrical engineering quickly became apparent. He went on to earn a PhD at MIT in just three years, finishing in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Notably, he studied under Claude Shannon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, the "father of information theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, who had returned to MIT as a professor after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Studying under Shannon was crucial for Jacobs's future contributions to the wireless and communications industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

After completing his PhD, Shannon and MIT asked Jacobs to stay on as a professor immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He spent five years teaching at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, during which he taught one of the world's first courses on [[digital_transformation_in_traditional_sectors_like_manufacturing_and_education | digital communications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, applying Shannon's theories to practical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. He also co-authored the first textbook on digital communications, which remains a foundational text ("the Bible of digital communication theory") and is still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Transition to Entrepreneurship and Industry

In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical from MIT to work at JPL (Jet Propulsion Labs) on the U.S. Space Program, focusing on communications with satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. There, he met Andrew Viterbi, another MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate, who became a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Upon returning to Boston, Jacobs received an offer from a former Cornell professor to start the electrical engineering department at the new UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Influenced by his positive experience in California and Viterbi's presence, he accepted and moved his family to San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

While teaching at UCSD, Jacobs continued his consulting work with defense contractors and JPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Recognizing the challenges of balancing this work with academia, he, Viterbi, and a third professor from UCLA decided to form a "shell company" to manage their consulting, initially not intending to create products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. They humorously named it "Linkabit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The third partner, Len Kleinrock, eventually left but went on to be a core founding father of the internet, involved in sending the first message on ARPANET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Linkabit, under Jacobs and Viterbi, primarily focused on NASA and Navy defense projects, particularly in satellite communications, where efficient use of narrow bandwidth was critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. They leveraged patented spread spectrum technology from the World War II era, invented by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

In 1971, Jacobs took a sabbatical from UCSD to organize Linkabit, ultimately deciding not to return to academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The company began to shift from being a subcontractor to bidding on prime contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This led Linkabit into the commercial sphere, and their very first commercial project was designing the satellite communication system for Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Walmart, under its eccentric founder Sam Walton, invested tens of millions of dollars in building a private satellite relay for store data and internal broadcasts, highlighting its innovative approach to [[shift_in_retail_with_technology_and_ecommerce | retail technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

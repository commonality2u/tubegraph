The "Idea Dinner" is a special segment of the Acquired podcast where the hosts and guests present their top stock investment ideas [00:07:44]. This particular iteration of the segment recreated a past episode from February 2021, when Clubhouse was popular and [[gamestop_meme_stock_hearings | GameStop]] was "going to the moon" [00:05:47].

## Participants and Rules

Hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal were joined by internet friends Packy McCormick (Not Boring) and Mario Gabriele (The Generalist) [00:05:55]. They gathered to pick stocks, emphasizing that it was not investment advice and encouraging listeners to do their own research [00:06:05]. The objective was to espouse a profitable investment idea starting on May 4th, 2022, with a specified time frame [00:09:11].

To raise the stakes, Shu Nyatta, a long-time friend of the show and former SoftBank Latin America managing director, was introduced as a judge [00:07:07]. Nyatta would grade each pick, declaring a winner and a loser [00:07:13]. The selection order was based on whose picks historically performed the best, which David Rosenthal claimed to be his [00:07:51].

## Investment Pitches

### Mario Gabriele: Snowflake
Mario Gabriele, founder of The Generalist, a publication covering tech, crypto, and venture capital, presented Snowflake as his pick [00:08:32, 00:09:52].

*   **Company Overview:** Snowflake is a managed data warehouse that initially gained prominence by separating storage and compute, making it easy to ingest and query data quickly [00:10:04]. It was a "pandemic darling" with a significant IPO day pop, trading as high as $403 per share before dropping to around $183-$185 by the time of the dinner, reflecting "multiple compression" [00:10:29, 00:10:45].
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Strong Growth & Metrics:** Despite stock hammering, Snowflake showed strong underlying performance: revenue up 105%, net retention at 178% (a potential record for a public company), and generating over $80 million in free cash flow [00:11:09, 00:11:21, 00:11:34]. Q4 contract value equaled the prior year's total revenue [00:11:39].
    *   **Market Tailwinds:** It's a play on the enduring growth of data in the technology industry [00:12:08].
    *   **Leadership:** Led by Frank Slootman, described as a "quintessential sustainable growth CEO" known for managing in difficult circumstances, compared to General Patton [00:12:20, 00:12:30].
*   **Time Horizon:** Mario sees it as a business with potential to compound over a three-plus year time horizon [00:12:01].
*   **Competitive Standing:** Its net retention suggests strong growth within its customer base, growing faster than other cloud companies [00:13:37].

### Packy McCormick: OpenDoor
Packy McCormick, acknowledging his own past struggles as a "terrible terrible stock picker" [00:14:32], first mentioned some "safe" options like automated trading strategies via Composer, and a potential investment in Elon Musk's Twitter take-private deal [00:15:05, 00:15:45]. He argued Twitter was undervalued given its loyal user base and potential for monetization, suggesting a 2x return if taken public again [00:17:05, 00:18:00].

*   **Actual Pick: OpenDoor:** His actual pick was OpenDoor, doubling down on what he admitted was his "biggest loser" historically [00:18:21, 00:19:13].
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Market Dominance:** OpenDoor "vanquished" Seattle-based Zillow's iBuying program, now owning the iBuying market itself [00:18:33].
    *   **Financials:** Did $8 billion in revenue last year, trading at a $5 billion market cap [00:19:05].
    *   **Market Opportunity:** Housing is a multi-trillion dollar market with a "terrible UI/UX customer experience" [00:19:12, 00:19:24]. OpenDoor offers the best solution with iBuying [00:19:31].
    *   **Operational Soundness:** Operationally "super sound," having turned an adjusted EBITDA profit last year [00:19:47, 00:19:50]. They are excellent at extracting "every basis point" of cost from operating homes [00:20:09].
    *   **Leadership:** Eric Wu is an "absolute monster" [00:20:05].
*   **Outlook:** Believes the market is OpenDoor's to lose, with Zillow exiting iBuying [00:20:01].

### Ben Gilbert: Coinbase
Ben Gilbert, co-founder and managing director at Pioneer Square Labs, considered Google (calling it the "best pick any of us made" besides Solana) and Amazon retail, but ultimately chose Coinbase [00:21:48, 00:22:13, 00:23:22]. He also mentioned the Twitter arbitrage opportunity [00:22:34].

*   **Pick: Coinbase:** He framed Coinbase as a "crypto value investment" [00:23:31].
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Financial Strength:** Generated $10 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months, with a market cap of $34 billion at closing [00:23:39, 00:23:54]. This represents an extremely low price-to-cash flow multiple [00:24:00].
    *   **Market Position:** Leading brand in the crypto space with strong network effects, operating in the "first inning of all of crypto" [00:24:17, 00:24:34].
    *   **Diversification/Optionality:** Has "free options" stapled to the business, including an NFT business [00:25:11].
    *   **Business Model:** Companies like Coinbase and FTX profit from market volatility (crypto going up or down faster) [00:25:42].
    *   **Strategy:** A way to play crypto and Web3 by investing in companies that have centralized activity and can run "Web2 style businesses" using the "heat and light" from Web3 [00:25:21].
*   **Analogy:** A "Berkshire Hathaway style investment into a crypto company" [00:24:40].
*   **Concerns (from Packy):** Potential "post-IPO brain drain," and competition from FTX, which is better positioned for the larger derivatives market [00:26:11, 00:27:02].

### David Rosenthal: Amazon
David Rosenthal, an angel investor based in San Francisco, chose Amazon, the company that bought the naming rights for Climate Pledge Arena where the show was held [00:28:53, 00:29:00].

*   **Pick: Amazon:** Trading at about a $1.25 trillion market cap after its stock was "hammered" due to recent earnings [00:29:12, 00:29:20].
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Revenue Scale:** Achieved $470 billion in revenue in the last 12 months, the second-highest amount ever (behind Walmart), which it is expected to surpass soon [00:29:32]. Trades at 2.5 times last 12 months' revenue [00:29:48].
    *   **AWS Strength:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) accounts for $75 billion of revenue and is a very high-margin business [00:30:08]. Despite competitors (Azure, Google Cloud) growing faster, AWS is growing at 37% annually on a $75 billion base, and its market share is still larger than both combined [00:30:51, 00:31:01, 00:31:06]. It is the "picks and shovels of the internet" [00:31:20].
    *   **Retail Value:** Dismissed the narrative that Amazon's retail business is worth zero. He noted his own personal spend on Amazon has grown 34% annually over five years, ordering 230 items in the last 12 months [00:32:18, 00:32:56, 00:33:04]. The retail segment also includes a $30 billion high-margin advertising business [00:33:18]. Amazon's retail losses are due to massive investment ahead of the curve, creating a deep moat [00:33:34, 00:33:47].
    *   **Bezos Framework:** Aligned with Jeff Bezos's framework of focusing on what won't change: the internet will keep growing (AWS) and people will continue buying more online (Amazon retail) [00:34:07]. Amazon will continue adding high-margin products like credit cards, advertising, and "Buy with Prime" [00:34:29].
*   **Leadership:** Suggested Andy Jassy could be the "Tim Cook of Amazon," in a positive analogy [00:34:57].

## Judge's Commentary and Verdict

Shu Nyatta offered general comments on the pitches [00:35:10]:
*   **Narrative Power:** The hosts and guests are good stock pickers because they understand the "power of stories and narratives," which he sees as the "future of investing" [00:35:23, 00:35:32].
*   **Venture Investor Mindset:** Noted that everyone thought like venture investors, focusing solely on upside and not discussing downside or what could go wrong [00:35:50, 00:36:00]. He gave Coinbase as an example, questioning the sustainability of its consumer pricing [00:36:06].
*   **Focus on "Cheap" Companies:** Observed that all picks were focused on companies perceived as "cheap" due to the current market cycle [00:36:29].
*   **Criteria:** Nyatta's own criteria for judging included upside, downside, timing ("why now"), novelty (on which he said all picks "failed"), and flair [00:36:54].

The audience voted by applause, leading to a runoff between Snowflake and Coinbase [00:38:40, 00:39:04].
*   **Winner (Audience):** Coinbase [00:39:30].
*   **Judge's Pick:** Snowflake, "only because of General Patton" (referring to Mario's description of Frank Slootman) [00:39:37].

The long-term performance of these picks will be tracked by a listener-maintained spreadsheet, with a five-year hold period [00:40:00, 00:40:18].

[[History and strategy of Benchmark Capital | Benchmark Capital]], a venture capital firm, played a pivotal role in the early success and trajectory of eBay, stepping in when nearly all other venture capitalists turned down the nascent online auction site. Their unique approach to investment, including unconventional deal structuring and hands-on operational support, proved instrumental in transforming eBay from a side project into a multi-billion dollar enterprise.

## The Genesis of a Partnership

Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, had prior experience with venture capital through his previous company, Inc., a pen computing firm that pivoted to e-commerce software and was eventually sold to Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. During his time at Inc., Omidyar got to know Bruce Dunleavy, who was an investor from Merrell Pickard Anderson and Air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. After Inc., Omidyar went on to work at General Magic, where he famously began tinkering with the early internet, leading to the creation of eBay as a collection of online services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Initially, eBay's "Auction Web" feature was free to use, but soaring server costs forced Omidyar to reluctantly ask users for a small listing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The overwhelming response, with checks flooding his apartment, signaled immense product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Omidyar brought on Jeff Skoll to manage the business operations, primarily opening and cashing the incoming checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

By mid-1997, eBay was growing 10% month-over-month and was profitable, generating cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Despite this, Omidyar, recalling his experiences at Inc. and General Magic, recognized the value of venture capitalists and a professional board to help scale the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. He and Skoll pitched their business to numerous firms on Sand Hill Road, but nearly everyone declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Benchmark's Non-Consensus Investment

[[Benchmarks investment in eBay | Benchmark]] was the sole firm interested in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Bruce Dunleavy, remembering Omidyar from the Inc. days, showed interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Benchmark partners Bob and David were also key players, with Bob being particularly interested in consumer marketing and psychology, and David offering to help build out the management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The entire [[Key figures in early Benchmark Capital | Benchmark team]], including Kevin and Andy, supported the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Benchmark offered Omidyar and Skoll a term sheet for a $6.7 million Series A financing round at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. At the time, they had a competing offer from Knight Ridder, a newspaper conglomerate, for an acquisition of eBay at $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This was a significant offer, especially for a two-person company that was barely a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Unique Deal Structure: Equity-Backed Loans

A key and highly untraditional aspect of [[Notable investments and decisions by Benchmark | Benchmark's]] investment was the inclusion of equity-backed loans to Omidyar and Skoll. While the exact details are debated, reports suggest Benchmark provided $750,000 each to Omidyar and Skoll (a total of $1.5 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This effectively acted as a secondary transaction, allowing the founders to take some money off the table and giving them an incentive *not* to accept the Knight Ridder acquisition offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This non-consensus move allowed Omidyar and Skoll to become comfortable financially, removing the pressure to sell the company for $50 million and instead aim for a much larger outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

At the time, this type of secondary transaction in a venture deal was almost unheard of; Benchmark was one of the only VCs willing to structure such a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Operational Support and Astronomical Returns

The deal closed in the summer of 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. With Benchmark and David Beirne's active involvement, they successfully recruited Meg Whitman, a "superstar" from Hasbro and previously Disney, to join as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This strategic hire was crucial for professionalizing the business and preparing it for public markets.

The fruits of this partnership ripened rapidly. In September 1998, just over a year after the investment, eBay went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. At the IPO, Benchmark's initial $6.7 million stake was worth $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. However, due to a six-month lockup period, they couldn't distribute their shares immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. By the time the lockup expired in the spring of 1999, that stake had soared to over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

This represented an astounding return for [[Benchmarks investment in eBay | Benchmark]]: $6.7 million invested turned into $4 billion in less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This single investment, from an $85 million fund, alone generated a 47x return on their entire fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. If the reported equity-backed loans were indeed incremental, it could have added another $1 billion to their returns, an additional 12x on the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Benchmark famously distributed at least $4 billion to its limited partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

The massive success of eBay underscored the power of [[Impact of Benchmarks equal partnership model | Benchmark's equal partnership model]] and its willingness to make unconventional bets. The premium carry structure, where partners shared profits equally, meant that even after accounting for the initial return to limited partners, there was approximately $1.5 billion in carry distributed amongst the partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Famously, even Benchmark's assistants received pieces of the carry, becoming multi-millionaires from the eBay success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

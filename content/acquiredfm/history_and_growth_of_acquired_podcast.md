The [[growth_and_evolution_of_the_acquired_podcast | Acquired podcast]] has experienced significant growth and evolution, culminating in large-scale live events and a rapidly expanding audience.

## Founding and Early Days
The co-hosts, Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, first met at a Passover seder hosted by Greg Goddisdman in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. David had several podcast ideas, and Ben, who initially didn't know what a podcast was, was particularly drawn to the "Acquired" concept, agreeing to co-host it immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Period of Breakout Growth
The podcast's [[acquired_podcast_audience_growth_and_dynamics | breakout period]] is largely attributed to the last six months, with a major turning point being the [[impact_of_wall_street_journal_article_on_acquired_podcast | Wall Street Journal article]] published in May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This article led to a quarter-million new subscribers "overnight" within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The podcast has now accumulated over 5 million listening hours, with that number tripling in the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## The Chase Center Live Show
A monumental event in the podcast's history was the "Acquired Live at Chase Center" show.
This event originated from a call with the JP Morgan team, who initially suggested a small event at the Chase Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Recognizing the opportunity, the JP Morgan Payments team developed a proposal for a dedicated live "Acquired" event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The partnership with JP Morgan was considered ideal because the team deeply understands the show's content as listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, enabling seamless collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Event Planning and Execution
Planning the event was a "mad dash" to create an amazing experience for thousands of attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The collaboration with JP Morgan Payments was special, bringing the podcast's brand to a grand scale, from posters to stage art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Artist Don Don designed the event's artwork, including stadium-wide displays, which helped to physically instantiate the "Acquired brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Community Engagement
A pre-show tradition for Ben and David, going for a run together, was extended to the audience, allowing over 100 listeners to join them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This provided an opportunity for the hosts to connect with listeners and manage their nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Live Show Highlights
The live show at the Chase Center, hosted by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, was described as "unbelievable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Mark Zuckerberg's Appearance**: Mark Zuckerberg was a guest, and his presence created an "electric feeling" in the arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. He famously "threw away the playbook" from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. A notable moment was when he admitted that Facebook/Meta's political miscalculation was a "20-year mistake," a statement that "dropped jaws" across the arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Mike Taylor's Performance**: Mike Taylor, a major recording artist with hundreds of millions of Spotify listens, performed the podcast's theme song live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Jamie Dimon Mention**: There were "whispers and murmurs" when Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, was mentioned, creating anticipation among the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Despite the exhaustion from the event, the team acknowledged that [[podcasting_strategy_and_audience_engagement | podcasts]] typically "don't do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, paralleling the philosophy of great companies that "don't follow the rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. While the co-hosts were "a lot bit in the mindset of like never again" after such a massive undertaking, they also hinted at future possibilities with a "2025" tease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

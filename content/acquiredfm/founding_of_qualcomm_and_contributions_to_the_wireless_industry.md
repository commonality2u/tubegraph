Erwin Mark Jacobs, an American born in 1933 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, is a key figure in the founding of [[qualcomms_origin_and_founding | Qualcomm]] and a pioneer in the wireless communications industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Early Life and Education

Jacobs grew up in a middle-class family; his father managed a local restaurant called the Boston Beef Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He showed early promise in math and sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Despite a high school guidance counselor advising him that "there's no future for Math and Science in New Bedford" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, Jacobs pursued his interests. He initially attended the Cornell School of Hotel Management, encouraged to join the family business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

After a year and a half, he transferred to electrical engineering, realizing the commercial potential of math and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Jacobs later credited his time in hotel management with providing him crucial business and accounting knowledge that proved invaluable when starting his first company and later [[qualcomms_origin_and_founding | Qualcomm]], helping him transition from academia to entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

He went on to earn a PhD from MIT in just three years, finishing in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. At MIT, he studied under Claude Shannon, considered the "father of information theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Academic Contributions

After completing his PhD, Jacobs was asked to remain at MIT as a professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He spent five years teaching there, during which he taught the world's first course on digital communications, applying Shannon's theories to practical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. He also co-authored the first textbook on digital communications, which remains a foundational text today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Transition to Entrepreneurship: Linkabit

In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California, where he worked on the U.S. Space Program and satellite communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Here, he met Andrew Viterbi, another MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate, and they became close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Soon after, Jacobs was offered a position to start the electrical engineering department at the new UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. He accepted and moved his family to San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. While teaching, he continued his consulting work with defense contractors and JPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Recognizing the challenges of balancing their academic and consulting work, Jacobs, Viterbi, and a third professor from UCLA, Len Kleinrock, decided to form a "shell company" to manage their consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. They "tongue-in-cheek" named it Linkabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Kleinrock later left Linkabit but went on to be a "founding engineer" on the ARPANET project, sending the first internet transmission ever from UCLA to Stanford, establishing himself as one of the "core founding fathers of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Linkabit's Evolution and First Commercial Project

Initially, Linkabit focused almost exclusively on defense contracting, particularly for NASA and Navy satellite communications, requiring highly efficient use of narrow bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. They recruited top talent in information theory and wireless signal processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. In 1971, Jacobs took a sabbatical from UCSD to organize Linkabit, ultimately never returning to academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

They realized that defense contractors, the "prime bidders," were profiting significantly from their differentiated engineering work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This led Linkabit to transition into a "contract-focused Services Company" that could bid on contracts directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. To achieve this, they needed to move into the commercial sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

Linkabit's first major commercial project was designing the satellite communication system for Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. This involved building a private satellite relay for the retailer, which was investing tens of millions of dollars in the late 1970s and early 1980s to improve data tabulation and enable broadcasts from founder Sam Walton to all stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This project utilized "spread spectrum technology," an old patented technology from the World War II era invented by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This experience laid the groundwork for [[qualcomms_history_and_strategic_maneuevers | Qualcomm's]] future developments in wireless communications.

Machine learning (ML) is considered a "massive pillar" of [[Amazons business strategy and competitive dynamics | Amazon's business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Each year, [[Amazon Web Services AWS | Amazon]] announces new initiatives in the database sector, which is recognized for its importance in customer stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Similarly, [[Amazons strategy in cloud storage and machine learning | Amazon]] has made significant announcements regarding machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## ML Offerings

[[Amazon Web Services AWS | Amazon]] has introduced several ML-related offerings:
*   **[[Amazon Sagemaker and ML offerings | Sagemaker]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   A dedicated custom ML keynote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Numerous cloud-hosted ML offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Support for TensorFlow, a framework originally created by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Their own container service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Their own Elastic Kubernetes Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While they support Kubernetes to serve customer demand, they also encourage customers to use their custom ECS (Amazon Container Service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to ML

[[Amazons strategy in cloud storage and machine learning | Amazon's strategy]] for machine learning centers on data proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The company's ML capabilities need to be strong, but do not necessarily need to outperform Google's in every aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The core principle is that users will utilize the ML services available where their data is stored, as running machine learning near the data is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Once [[Amazon Web Services AWS | Amazon]] is chosen as the primary storage vendor, with data residing in their data centers, customers are expected to run their ML workloads on [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. While [[Amazon Web Services AWS | Amazon]] cannot afford to lag significantly behind competitors in ML, its dominant position in data storage gives it a strategic advantage even if [[Comparison of Amazon and Google ML capabilities | Google's ML offerings]] might theoretically be superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. If customers are not storing their data with Google, the quality of Google's ML offerings becomes less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

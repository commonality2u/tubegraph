Amazon has positioned machine learning (ML) as a significant pillar of its business, alongside compute and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While compute forms a massive pillar, and databases are gaining importance, machine learning is clearly a key focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Strategic Importance
Every year, Amazon announces new database offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Similarly, in the ML space, they have introduced [[AWS machine learning services like SageMaker | SageMaker]] and dedicated a custom ML keynote at their events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This dedicated focus underscores the strategic importance of machine learning to AWS.

## Machine Learning Offerings
Amazon provides a wide array of cloud-hosted ML offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. They support popular frameworks like TensorFlow, originally created by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For containerization, they offer their own Amazon Container Service (ECS) while also supporting the Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to cater to customer preferences for Kubernetes, though they aim to encourage the use of their custom ECS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Strategic Advantage through Data Location
Amazon's strategy regarding machine learning capabilities is distinctive: their ML services need to be robust, but not necessarily superior to competitors like Google's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This is based on the principle that customers will primarily use the ML services available where their data is already stored, as running machine learning near the data is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Once a customer chooses Amazon as their storage vendor and has transferred significant amounts of data to AWS data centers, they are unlikely to seek out different providers for their ML workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Instead, they will run their ML on AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

This [[AWS strategies for customer retention in machine learning | strategy]] implies that while AWS cannot afford to fall significantly behind in ML capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, their dominance in data storage provides a significant competitive advantage over companies like Google. This is true even if [[Comparison with Googles machine learning capabilities | Google might be better positioned to offer superior ML services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, because it may not matter if Google is not where customers are storing their primary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

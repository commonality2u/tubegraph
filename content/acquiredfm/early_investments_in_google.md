The earliest funding for Google was significantly influenced by individuals connected through a prior Amazon acquisition, leading to one of the most impactful [[key_investments_in_tech_industry | investments]] in tech history.

## The Junglee Connection
The story of Google's early funding is intertwined with Amazon's acquisition of Junglee, a comparison shopping site founded by three Stanford Computer Science PhDs and a business person from Netscape, Ram Shriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Amazon acquired Junglee for an estimated $150-175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

The Junglee team was required to move to Seattle, Amazon's base, due to tax nexus concerns in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, the acquisition was "ill-conceived" from the start, and the team quit within months, returning to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This same team would later found the company that was acquired by Walmart, which became Walmart Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Ram Shriram's Seed Investment
Upon returning to Palo Alto, Ram Shriram connected with two other Stanford Computer Science PhDs: Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Ram found their "BackRub page rank" concept promising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Ram Shriram made the first [[venture_capital_and_early_tech_investments | investment]] in Google, contributing $250,000 and joining the company's board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This initial funding occurred while Amazon was already a public company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Jeff Bezos's Personal Investment
About six months after Ram Shriram's investment, [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Jeff Bezos]] heard about Google through Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. [[Jeff Bezos]] and MacKenzie Bezos traveled to [[silicon_valley_investment_culture | Silicon Valley]] and met Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Ram's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Despite the seed round being closed and Series A discussions with major [[venture_capital_and_early_tech_investments | venture capital]] firms like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital already underway, [[Jeff Bezos]] expressed a strong desire to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He insisted on investing personally at the same seed price as Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Ram successfully convinced Larry Page and Sergey Brin to accept another $250,000 of [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Jeff]] and MacKenzie Bezos's personal money at the seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Google's Series A and IPO Valuation
Google's Series A funding round, famously split between John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and Mike Moritz of Sequoia Capital, valued the company at a $100 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This valuation was considered "insane for the time," with Mike Moritz reportedly stating, "We've never paid so much for so little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

It is speculated that Ram Shriram's initial investment valued Google at around $10 million post-money, potentially giving him a 10 to 20x return by the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It is estimated that [[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Jeff]] and MacKenzie Bezos likely owned at least one percent of Google personally, even after dilution from the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Google went public solely on the strength of this Series A funding, without raising further venture rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

When Google IPO'd in 2004, it had a market cap of $23 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. At that point, the Bezos's shares, assuming at least one percent ownership, would have been worth approximately $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Since then, Google's value has increased by 65x over the next 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

[[jeff_bezos_and_early_internet_business_exploration | Jeff Bezos]] has never publicly commented on whether he and MacKenzie sold their Google shares, but they would not have had the opportunity to sell before the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This early [[experience_as_an_angel_investor | angel investment]] provided [[Jeff Bezos]] with significant capital, enabling him to fund various ventures like rocket companies and [[venture_capital_and_early_tech_investments | venture funds]] such as [[benchmarks_investment_strategy_in_ebay | Benchmark]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The relationship maintained with Ram Shriram after Amazon's Junglee acquisition ultimately provided [[Jeff Bezos]] with access to this highly lucrative early investment opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

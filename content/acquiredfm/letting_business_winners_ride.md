One of the key lessons derived from analyzing numerous companies is the importance of "letting your winners ride." This concept highlights that the true value of successful ventures often materializes over extended periods, making early exits a significant missed opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.

## Sequoia's Apple Mistake
Sequoia Capital's biggest mistake in history, arguably the single largest mistake in investing history, involved their early investment in Apple Computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.

In 1977, Don Valentine, the founder of Sequoia, invested $150,000 in Apple after a recommendation from Nolan Bushnell, Atari's CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>. Just 18 months later, Sequoia realized a 40x return, selling their shares for $6 million before Apple's IPO, completely clearing their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>. This decision, while yielding impressive [[maintaining_focus_in_venture_capital_amidst_growth_opportunities | venture returns]] at the time, overlooked the immense long-term growth potential of Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>.

## The Amazon Example
The principle of letting winners ride is further exemplified by Amazon's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:19">[01:22:19]</a>. Amazon IPO'd at $8 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:08">[01:25:08]</a>. Holding those shares for 13 years would have yielded a 10x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:54">[01:29:54]</a>. However, holding for another 10 years (totaling 20 years from IPO) would have resulted in an astonishing 170x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:28">[01:20:28]</a>. The growth seen before 2012, when Amazon was almost 20 years old and considered a "mature company," appears "cute" in comparison to its subsequent expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>.

## The Underlying Insight
The key insight is that a company's success isn't about its growth rate in any single year, but rather "how many years of growth do you have left?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>. This leads venture capitalists to obsess over Total Addressable Market (TAM), as companies need to operate in massive, globally addressable markets to sustain growth for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>.

The nature of compounding means that "all of the value tends to show up in the out years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:31">[02:13:31]</a>.

This underscores the vast "running room" that Amazon had after its IPO, emphasizing the importance of long-term vision in [[lessons_from_successful_company_strategies | company strategies]] and investment.

Copyright law's fundamental purpose across all intellectual property — including music, trademarks, and patents — is to spur innovation and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This principle is central to understanding how music licensing works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Two Foundational Music Copyrights

When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence:

1.  **Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording/Master)**
    This copyright covers the literal recording of the music as it was produced in a studio and can be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Traditionally, the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] owns these masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Labels assume ownership by taking on the financial risk associated with betting on, distributing, and promoting an artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This historical model is compared to early venture capital, where investors took majority ownership for providing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

2.  **Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)**
    This copyright pertains to the written lyrics and melody of a song, representing the "idea" of the song before it's recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Traditionally, [[artists_rights_and_music_ownership | songwriters]] hold these rights, often through [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | music publishers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Publishers historically took 50% of royalties from composition copyrights, though this percentage is significantly lower today, sometimes reduced to a fixed fee for back-office services for larger songwriters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. In the era before recorded music, publishers were immensely powerful because publishing rights (sheet music) were the major rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

These two copyrights form the foundational building blocks for all other uses of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Licensing and Veto Rights

Depending on the specific use case for music, either one or both of these copyright approvals may be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Both the owner of the sound recording master right and the owner of the publishing right typically have a veto right on who can use the final product when both are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The income splits and generated revenues can vary widely based on the music's use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Co-writing Credits

Songwriting credits and their associated splits are privately negotiated among songwriters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For approvals requiring a publishing license, multiple co-writers may need to sign off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Money flow can be unique, ranging from 50/50 splits to 90/10, or even a flat fee for a guest writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Economic Splits and Recoupment

The way royalties and earnings are split highlights the power dynamics inherent in music licensing.

### Splits with Labels vs. Publishers
Historically, [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | publishers]] might have kept 50% of songwriting economics, while artists kept 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. However, this was considered a relatively good deal for the artist compared to the splits with record labels on the master side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. When an artist signs a distribution deal where a [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] fronts money to make an album and subsequently owns the master, the artist's royalty stream is significantly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. An artist might only receive 10-15%, or up to 20-22% for very large artists, with the majority of the economics going to the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Recoupment
A critical aspect of these deals is "recoupment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Artists only begin to participate in revenues after the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] has "recouped" its initial advance given to the artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For example, if a label provides a $500,000 advance, the first $500,000 generated from album sales or [[evolution_of_spotify_and_its_impact_on_the_music_industry | Spotify]] streams goes directly to the label before the artist receives their royalty percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This is analogous to a VC preference stack on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

This system, perceived as a "predatory deal" by some, arose from an era where producing and distributing music was extremely expensive, and most artists failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The significant upfront investment and high failure rate necessitated an economic split where the success of a few winning artists could offset the losses from many unsuccessful ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This model, however, has faced significant changes with the [[changes_in_the_music_industry_business_model | evolution of the music industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

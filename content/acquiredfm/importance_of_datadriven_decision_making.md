The view that "not all software is created equal" has been a consistent theme over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective extends to the evolution of data and its role in [[judgment_and_decisionmaking_in_investments | decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Rise of Databases

In 2000, databases represented the largest sector of software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Companies primarily deriving revenue from databases accounted for approximately a trillion dollars in market capitalization at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Data Explosion

Currently, more data is produced annually than in all preceding years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This ever-increasing volume of data necessitates finding a "home" for storage, as more sensors will be built in the future to gather even more data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Vision for Future Decision Making

Bill Gates once highlighted the need for a shift in how [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | decisions]] are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. When asked if all "interesting stuff" was done, he described current [[Investment Decision Making and Judgment | decision-making]] processes as "barbaric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

He predicted a future where:
*   All data will be stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Machines will analyze this data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Machines will assist in making better [[judgment_and_decisionmaking_in_investments | decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Examples provided for data-driven [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | decision making]] include:
*   Diagnosing an illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Educating a dyslexic child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Maintaining an aircraft's engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

Ultimately, Gates envisioned a future where all [[Investment Decision Making and Judgment | decisions]] would be made by machines analyzing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Implications for Technology and Business

This vision strongly supported the belief that the entire database market would be re-architected, specifically built for the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A key focus for many has been on the cloud infrastructure layer and the enablement required for enterprises to transition to the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This focus has proven to be a lucrative area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

JP Morgan Payments has played a significant role in facilitating Acquired's live events, demonstrating a partnership aimed at celebrating the podcast and its audience, rather than generating profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Previous Collaboration: San Francisco Live Show

In the previous year, Acquired hosted a live show in San Francisco, which was described as "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This event featured a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg at the Chase Center Arena, in collaboration with [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_payments | JP Morgan Payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. More than 6,000 people attended the show at Chase Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Planning the New York City Live Event

Following the success of the San Francisco event, a "postgame" discussion with the [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_payments | JP Morgan team]] led to the decision to host another event in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The goal was to create an event that felt "uniquely New York and authentic to the Acquired cannon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Event Details and Venue

The upcoming Acquired Live event is scheduled for the evening of July 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, at Radio City Music Hall in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Radio City Music Hall is an iconic New York City theater known for hosting events like the Rockets, Tony Awards, Grammys, MTV VMAs, and NFL draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. It is also a significant part of Rockefeller Center, connecting to the physical legacy of Standard Oil and [[john_d_rockefellers_impact_on_the_oil_industry | John D. Rockefeller]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### Production and Scale

The physical production of the New York show is described as "nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The stage at Radio City Music Hall will be three times the width of the one used at Chase Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Radio City is the world's largest indoor theater, capable of seating 6,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. New York City also represents a larger listener base for Acquired than the Bay Area, encompassing the entire Northeast Corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Ticketing and Purpose

Tickets for the event will be assigned seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a> and kept within a "narrow price range," around $100-$120, to ensure accessibility for as many attendees as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. The event is not intended to be profit-generating for either Acquired or [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_payments | JP Morgan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Instead, all revenue from tickets will be allocated towards production costs, such as set design and compensating the "hundreds of incredible crew members" required to execute the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. The primary goal is to celebrate Acquired and its audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

Attendees can expect opportunities to mingle with other listeners, access special Acquired Radio City merchandise, and celebrate with fellow "business nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

Acquired expressed gratitude to [[partnership_with_jp_morgan_payments | JP Morgan]] for their collaboration in "putting this on with us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

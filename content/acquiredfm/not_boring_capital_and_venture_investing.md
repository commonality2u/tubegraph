Not Boring, a media and investment empire founded by [[growth_and_strategy_of_not_boring | Packy McCormick]], has carved out a unique space by reinventing both the media business model and the startup investing business model [01:47:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>. Operating as a [[venture_capital_dynamics_and_firm_structure | solo corporation]], McCormick has leveraged his popular newsletter to build a [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | distinctive approach to venture capital]] through Not Boring Capital [01:10:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

## Origin and Evolution of Not Boring Capital

McCormick's path to venture investing was an emergent, unplanned evolution. After leaving a startup role at Breather, he began writing a newsletter, initially as "per my last email," exploring various startup ideas [00:43:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. The newsletter eventually became Not Boring, a name suggested by his mother, which then fueled his entrepreneurial endeavors [00:54:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. The transition to a venture investing model was not pre-meditated, but rather a response to natural opportunities [01:56:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:29">[01:56:29]</a>.

The idea for sponsored content, which later became a cornerstone of his investment strategy, came from Chris at MarketHire [01:10:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>. McCormick decided to write about companies he was genuinely bullish on and would consider investing in himself [01:12:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. These "sponsored deep dives" often provide more detailed and behind-the-scenes access to fast-growing startups than traditional journalism [01:13:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. This model allowed him to generate significant revenue from the newsletter, projecting to cross \$1 million in 2021 [01:37:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:28">[01:37:28]</a>.

### The Not Boring Flywheel

McCormick describes a "Not Boring Flywheel" with the audience at its core [02:32:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:34">[02:32:34]</a>). The alignment between the content, the audience, and the investing is a key driver [02:33:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:47">[02:33:47]</a>). The content attracts a specific type of audience, including founders and company leaders, which in turn feeds back into investment opportunities and sponsorships [02:34:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:01">[02:34:01]</a>).

> "The content has attracted a certain type of audience member who's both more valuable to companies and who also include people who are starting companies and running companies and all of that and it all just kind of feeds back into each other but I think maybe the core part is that the content itself is so aligned with the venture business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:59">[02:33:59]</a>

## Unique Investment Model

[[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | Not Boring Capital]] operates distinctively from traditional [[comparison_to_venture_capital_industry | venture capital firms]].

### Leveraging Platforms and Relationships
The entire operation is enabled by modern platforms and infrastructure. Services like AngelList are critical, providing a sophisticated back office that allows McCormick to manage funds and investments without a large internal team [02:09:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:01">[02:09:01]</a>). AngelList streamlines fundraising from LPs and provides portfolio visibility, effectively acting as an "AWS for a venture firm" [02:12:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:29">[02:12:29]</a>).

Deal flow for Not Boring Capital primarily comes from founders who are already readers of the newsletter [02:36:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:16">[02:36:16]</a>). If a founder is a "Not Boring fan," there's an immediate alignment and trust that transcends a transactional relationship [02:37:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:56">[02:37:56]</a>).

### Investment Strategy: Maximizing Winners
Not Boring Capital focuses on "what can go really, really right" with a company, rather than deep diligence into potential flaws [02:00:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:39">[02:00:39]</a>). This approach embodies the principle of [[venture_capital_as_a_probabilistic_endeavor | venture capital as a probabilistic endeavor]], where the goal is to maximize the winners, as "the zeros are meaningless" [02:04:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:13">[02:04:13]</a>).

> "The only thing that matters in venture capital are the ones you get right and that's kind of the point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:14">[02:03:14]</a>

McCormick doesn't lead rounds, write term sheets, or join boards [01:59:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>). This "light touch" strategy is a deliberate trade-off to maintain efficiency and focus on the core content creation that drives deal flow [01:59:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:30">[01:59:30]</a>).

## Growth and [[Challenges and Insights in the Venture Capital Landscape | Adaptations]]
Not Boring Capital successfully launched Fund 1 with \$9.99 million and Fund 2 is projected to be in the \$25-30 million range [02:05:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:54">[02:05:54]</a>). McCormick has made 91 investments in Fund 1 alone [01:57:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>). This volume of investments for a single individual is enabled by the unique "portfolio construction" and reliance on platforms like AngelList [02:03:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:56">[02:03:56]</a>).

McCormick also serves as an advisor to Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z), focusing on explaining complex web3 topics and helping portfolio companies tell their stories [02:28:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:41">[02:28:41]</a>). This collaboration highlights the growing trend of leveraging media and influence within [[Venture Capital and government interaction | venture capital]].

## Trade-offs and the "No Greed" Philosophy
Operating as a [[venture_capital_dynamics_and_firm_structure | solo corporation]] comes with significant trade-offs:
*   **Personal Dependence:** The entire enterprise is dependent on McCormick. If he stops writing, the momentum would slow, and the business could cease to exist [02:14:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>).
*   **Scaling Content vs. Business:** Expanding beyond the core content by building other businesses or hiring more writers could dilute the unique "flavor" and personal connection that defines Not Boring [02:16:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:02">[02:16:02]</a>).
*   **"No Greed" Principle:** McCormick consciously avoids getting "greedy" by pursuing too many additional ventures or lowering his standards for sponsored content and investments [02:56:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>). He believes that maintaining the core product's quality and authenticity is paramount, even if it means foregoing potentially higher returns [02:56:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:15">[02:56:15]</a>).

## Future Outlook
McCormick remains optimistic about the future of Not Boring. He believes that the newsletter can continue to grow, potentially reaching a million subscribers within the next five years, by consistently delivering content that offers a glimpse into the "very near future" in an approachable way [02:23:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:17">[02:23:17]</a>). His role is to translate complex, emerging trends, especially in web3, without being dismissive or overly technical [01:42:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>).

Despite the current tech bull run, McCormick acknowledges the risk of a potential bear market, which could challenge the optimistic tone of his content and investment strategy [02:25:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>). However, he aims for resilience, believing that even in a downturn, Not Boring can "reload and continue to grow" [02:25:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:31">[02:25:31]</a>).

McCormick's [[growth_and_strategy_of_not_boring | Not Boring]] venture is a testament to the evolving landscape of media and [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | investing]]. By embracing transparency, leveraging platforms, and maintaining a unique voice, he has created a powerful, scalable model that challenges [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | traditional norms]] in the venture capital world.

Renaissance Technologies (RenTech) utilized basket options as a clever method to increase their leverage, allowing them to juice returns from their reliable money-printing machine, the Medallion fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Most people should not take on leverage, as it can easily lead to financial ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:08">[02:13:08]</a>. However, RenTech believed their strategy was reliable enough to warrant it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:22">[02:13:22]</a>.

## What are Basket Options?
Basket options are financial instruments whose values are tied to the performance of a specific group of stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:38">[02:13:38]</a>. Unlike typical options based on individual stocks, these are linked to a collective of shares, rising in value if the underlying stocks increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:45">[02:13:45]</a>. It's akin to owning shares without actually possessing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:55">[02:13:55]</a>.

## RenTech's Use of Basket Options
In 2002, RenTech used basket options to significantly increase their capital by borrowing from banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:08">[02:14:08]</a>. The banks were the legal owners of the shares in the basket, but RenTech effectively controlled these assets, instructing the banks to trade the options. After a year, when long-term capital gains tax would apply, RenTech had the option to buy the basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:08">[02:14:08]</a>.

This strategy allowed Medallion to borrow far more than typically permitted. Competitors usually held about $7 of financial instruments for every dollar of cash, but Medallion's strategy allowed them to control $12.50 worth of financial instruments for every dollar of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:38">[02:14:38]</a>. When a particularly lucrative opportunity arose, they could boost leverage to nearly $20 of assets for every dollar of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:58">[02:14:58]</a>.

By 2002, Medallion managed over $5 billion but controlled more than $60 billion in investment positions through this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>. This massive leverage was crucial because RenTech's strategy, even with a slight edge (e.g., 50.01% chance of being right), required a huge volume of trades to generate substantial profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:04">[02:16:04]</a>. The unlevered returns from their strategy would have been significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:36">[02:15:36]</a>. While leverage is common among [[Quantitative trading strategies|Quant funds]], RenTech was particularly innovative in its application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:41">[02:15:41]</a>.

## Tax Implications
RenTech believed basket options offered a tax-efficient vehicle, classifying their earnings as long-term capital gains because they would only exercise the option to buy the basket after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:32">[02:16:32]</a>. They argued that the millions of daily trades within the basket were managed by the banks, not by RenTech directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:57">[02:16:57]</a>.

However, in 2021, the IRS ruled against RenTech, asserting that they had made all the trades and were not merely advising. The firm, including Jim Simons and other partners, was ordered to pay $6.8 billion in back taxes, penalties, and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:08">[02:17:08]</a>. Simons himself paid $670 million in back taxes due to this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:29">[02:17:29]</a>.

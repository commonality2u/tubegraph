The structure of the music licensing and record deal industry, particularly concerning master recordings, shares significant parallels with the [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture capital industry]], especially its earlier forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.

## Historical Parallels in Risk and Ownership

Historically, record labels assume ownership of master recordings (sound recording copyrights) in exchange for bearing the financial risk of distributing and promoting an artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. This model is akin to the "old school" [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | venture capital industry]] from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, where investors would take a majority stake in a company for providing the necessary capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:20">[01:24:20]</a>.

The market terms for taking on such risk have undergone tremendous changes in the [[the_evolution_of_venture_capital_and_public_markets | venture capital industry]] due to factors like the appetite for capital and potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>. In contrast, the music industry effectively has only about three major labels, leading to a concentrated power dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>.

## Recoupment and Preference Stacks

When an artist signs a distribution deal, a record label often provides an upfront advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:44">[06:07:44]</a>. The artist's royalty stream, typically 10-22% depending on their prominence, only begins after this advance has been "recouped" by the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:10">[06:00:10]</a>. This means the record label retains the initial revenues until the advance is paid back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This mechanism is directly compared to a [[venture_capital_dynamics_and_firm_structure | VC preference stack]] on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:36">[06:35:36]</a>.

## Risk Management and Failure Rates

These seemingly "predatory" deal structures stem from the high risk inherent in both industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:32">[07:05:32]</a>. Much like the [[venture_capital_as_a_probabilistic_endeavor | venture capital model]], where over 90% of startups may fail, record labels sink significant money into making albums, radio promotion, distribution, and customer acquisition before knowing if an artist will succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:10">[07:08:10]</a>. The economic splits are designed so that the success of a few winners can more than compensate for the financial losses incurred from the many artists or startups that do not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:01">[07:27:01]</a>.

This established system, rooted in an era where significant upfront investment was required to test market viability, is now facing questions as technology increasingly allows artists to build an audience without such traditional expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:07">[07:42:07]</a>.

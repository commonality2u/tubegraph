The technology industry has been shaped by pivotal investments made by venture capital firms, which have backed companies that have grown into global giants. This article explores some of these key investments, the firms behind them, and the strategies that led to their success or failure.

## Early Venture Capital Landscape (1990s)

In the early 1990s, the venture capital ecosystem was significantly smaller than it is today, with about a hundred times fewer venture capitalists [00:10:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The prevailing business models did not yet feature the gross margins, addressable market sizes, or zero distribution costs that would later define [[Impact of major tech companies like Apple Facebook and Microsoft | big tech]] [00:10:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Despite this, "arbitrage" opportunities existed where innovations created investable categories with few [[Venture capital and early tech investments | venture capitalists]] looking for them, leading to low valuations [00:11:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Kleiner Perkins and John Doerr
[[Challenges and strategies for major tech companies | John Doerr]] of [[History and strategy of technology companies | Kleiner Perkins]] was considered the "800-pound gorilla" of the [[Venture capital and early tech investments | VC ecosystem]] in the early 1990s, particularly during the internet era [00:09:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. His investment portfolio included:
*   **Compaq** [00:09:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   **Intuit** [00:09:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>
*   **Sun Microsystems** [00:09:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>
*   **Netscape** [00:10:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>
*   **Amazon** [00:10:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   **Google** (at a $100 million Series A valuation, considered "Earth changing" at the time) [00:10:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, [00:11:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>

Kleiner Perkins adopted a "modern Keiretsu" model, facilitating (and sometimes forcing) partnerships and business development relationships among their portfolio companies [00:12:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, [00:13:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

### Technology Venture Investors (TVI)
TVI, located on Sand Hill Road, made one of the most notable investments in venture capital history:
*   **Microsoft**: TVI was the only venture capital investor in Microsoft, putting in $1 million for 5% of the company [00:17:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, [00:17:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The firm reportedly did not raise another dollar until Microsoft's IPO [00:17:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This investment alone led to "declaring victory" and dissolving the firm [00:18:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, [00:27:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.
    *   Dave Marquardt, a partner at TVI, believed that the venture business "is an intensely personal relationship business and it's not an industry that scales well" [00:29:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. He advocated that companies should handle value-added services themselves, with VCS primarily serving to support and be steady [00:29:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>, [00:30:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Synopsis**: Bob Kagle, a junior investor at TVI, had early success with Synopsis [00:25:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

### Merrill Pickard Anderson & Eyre
Also sharing an office building on Sand Hill Road with TVI, Merrill Pickard made several successful investments:
*   **Palm Pilot**: This was one of the few successful companies from the pen computing era and a significant win for Bruce Dunleavy [00:31:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.
*   **Rambus**: A big winner in the semiconductor industry [00:31:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.

## Benchmark's Foundation and Early Bets

Benchmark Capital was founded on a "religious fervor" for an equal partnership model, contrasting with the hierarchical structures of firms like Kleiner Perkins [00:25:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>, [00:35:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. The firm's founders were Bob Kagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, Kevin Harvey, and Val Vaden [00:39:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. They launched Fund One, an $85 million fund, with audacious 30% carry fees (compared to the standard 20%) [00:41:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>, [00:42:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.

### Webvan
David Byrne, a top executive recruiter, joined Benchmark in 1997 as the fifth partner [00:57:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. His first deal at Benchmark was Webvan [01:00:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.
*   **Webvan**: A highly ambitious e-commerce venture co-led by Benchmark (David Byrne) and Sequoia (Mike Moritz) [01:06:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. Benchmark and Sequoia each invested $3.5 million [01:06:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>. Although often cited as a dot-com bubble excess, it was considered a "great bet to make" for venture capital given its vision of an "everything store" delivered to the doorstep [01:02:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>, [01:03:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Webvan went public, reaching an $8 billion market cap, turning the $3.5 million investment into $800 million in public stock at its peak [01:06:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

### eBay
Benchmark's most significant early investment was eBay:
*   **eBay**: Pierre Omidyar, an engineer and former colleague of Bruce Dunleavy, started Auction Web (which became eBay) as a side project [01:13:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>, [01:14:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>. The company gained significant traction and became profitable by charging listing fees to cover server costs [01:14:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Benchmark was the only firm to offer a term sheet, investing $6.7 million at a $20 million pre-money valuation [01:17:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>, [01:17:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. They also reportedly provided equity-backed loans to Omidyar and Jeff Skoll to incentivize them against an acquisition offer from Knight Ridder [01:20:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>.
    *   This investment, completed in June 1997, saw Benchmark's stake worth $400 million by the IPO in September 1998 [01:23:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>, [01:23:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. By the time the lockup expired in Spring 1999, the stake was worth over $4 billion [01:23:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>, [01:23:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>. This $6.7 million investment turned into $4 billion in under two years, yielding a 47x return on their fund [01:23:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>, [01:23:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>. Fund One was one of, if not the best, performing [[Venture capital and early tech investments | Venture Fund]] in history, returning billions to LPs [01:44:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>.

### Accept.com
Incubated by Benchmark and founded by Danny Shader, Accept.com was created to handle payments for eBay auctions [01:26:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:43">[01:26:43]</a>, [01:26:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>. Although eBay initially showed interest but didn't invest, Amazon later acquired Accept.com for $175 million in stock, leading to a long-standing relationship between Jeff Bezos and Benchmark [01:28:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17">[01:28:17]</a>, [01:28:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>, [01:28:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>.

## The Dot-Com Era and Expansion

After the success of eBay, Benchmark sought to expand its influence. They missed out on several significant opportunities during this period due to conflicts and internal discussions around [[Corporate strategy and organizational change in tech companies | corporate strategy]] and [[Strategic vision and business pivots in the tech industry | business pivots]].

*   **Google**: Benchmark had an opportunity to pursue Google but "failed to pursue" the investment with their typical drive [02:22:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:40">[02:22:40]</a>, [02:23:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:05">[02:23:05]</a>.
*   **Skype**: The firm missed the opportunity to invest in Skype, which emerged from Estonia, due to internal debates on whether their Menlo Park or Europe fund should lead [02:24:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:56">[02:24:56]</a>, [02:25:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>.
*   **Facebook**: Benchmark was conflicted out of the Facebook investment because they had previously invested in Friendster [02:26:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:13">[02:26:13]</a>, [02:26:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:15">[02:26:15]</a>.

## The "Fab Four" Era (Mid-2000s onwards)

Following a period of internal debate and some missed opportunities, Benchmark regrouped, returning to its core principles of early-stage focus and equal partnership. This led to the formation of the "Fab Four" era, featuring Bill Gurley, Peter Fenton, Mitch Laskey, and Matt Kohler.

### Bill Gurley's Marketplace Investments
[[investment strategies and stock picking in tech | Bill Gurley]] joined Benchmark in the late 1990s [02:05:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:41">[02:05:41]</a>. He became known for his analytical approach and investments in marketplaces:

### Matt Kohler's Consumer Social Expertise
Matt Kohler, an early employee at LinkedIn and Facebook (employee #5), joined the firm and brought a deep understanding of consumer social products [02:41:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:11">[02:41:11]</a>, [02:41:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:17">[02:41:17]</a>. His notable investments include:
*   **Instagram** (Series A sold 12 months after investment for a 20x return) [02:46:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:08">[02:46:08]</a>, [02:46:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a>
*   **Asana** (Matt's first investment) [02:46:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:55">[02:46:55]</a>

### Uber
*   **Uber**: Gurley had been actively searching for a company in the ride-sharing space before finding Uber [02:56:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:03">[02:56:03]</a>. Benchmark invested $10 million in the Series A round at a $60 million post-money valuation in 2011 [02:56:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:36">[02:56:36]</a>, [02:56:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:39">[02:56:39]</a>. By 2018, Benchmark's Uber stake was worth $8 billion, constituting the bulk of Fund 7's returns [02:54:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:08">[02:54:08]</a>, [02:54:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:12">[02:54:12]</a>, [02:54:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:15">[02:54:15]</a>. They later sold $900 million worth of Uber shares to SoftBank [02:54:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:47">[02:54:47]</a>.

## Current Benchmark Partnership

The current Benchmark partnership (as of late 2022) includes Peter Fenton (the last active GP from the Fab Four era), Eric Vishria, Sarah Tavel, Chetan Puttagunta, and Miles Grimshaw [03:10:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:24">[03:10:24]</a>, [03:10:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:30">[03:10:30]</a>, [03:19:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:37">[03:19:37]</a>, [03:19:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:40">[03:19:40]</a>.

*   **MongoDB** [03:18:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>

### Miles Grimshaw
Miles Grimshaw, previously a "wonderkind" at Thrive Capital, joined Benchmark in 2021 [03:18:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:43">[03:18:43]</a>, [03:18:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:46">[03:18:46]</a>. He overlapped with Peter Fenton on the Dinner Table board and with Eric Vishria on the Benchling board [03:19:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:03">[03:19:03]</a>, [03:19:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:06">[03:19:06]</a>, [03:19:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:08">[03:19:08]</a>.

## Investment Strategies and Philosophy

Benchmark's philosophy is rooted in several core tenets:
*   **Equal Partnership**: Every partner has equal carry in a given fund and owns the management company, fostering teamwork and trust by removing individual incentives for credit [01:40:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>, [01:40:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>. This model, often called "communist capital" by critics, requires every partner to bring equal value, effort, and output [01:45:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:22">[01:45:22]</a>, [01:46:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:02">[01:46:02]</a>.
*   **No Junior Partners**: Unlike most firms, Benchmark does not employ junior partners, ensuring every partner is a full, equal contributor from day one [01:52:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:49">[01:52:49]</a>, [02:02:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:51">[02:02:51]</a>. This limits the pool of potential partners to seasoned investors who have already "burned through all the capital being a bad VC" [02:03:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:13">[02:03:13]</a>, [02:03:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:45">[02:03:45]</a>.
*   **"Balls and Brains"**: The firm values both audacious risk-taking and deep analytical rigor, often seen in investments like eBay and Uber [02:09:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:38">[02:09:38]</a>, [02:10:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Series A**: Over time, Benchmark shifted its focus from "seed and startup" to Series A investments, particularly in consumer companies, recognizing that data and traction could de-risk investments at this later stage [02:10:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:42">[02:10:42]</a>, [02:11:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:07">[02:11:07]</a>, [02:11:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:51">[02:11:51]</a>.
*   **Counter-Positioning**: Benchmark's existence and success are seen as a "perfect and pure illustration of counter positioning" against larger, more hierarchical firms [03:28:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:01">[03:28:01]</a>, [03:28:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:04">[03:28:04]</a>.

From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Klarna, a company founded 19 years ago in Stockholm, initially made the conclusion that there was "no need" for their buy now pay later (BNPL) product in markets like the US and UK due to the prevalence of credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>. This perception changed as the market evolved, revealing significant [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_browser_market | opportunities]] and [[competition_and_market_dynamics_in_the_payment_industry | challenges]].

## Initial Market Assessment and Shift

Klarna's early focus on markets like Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands was driven by existing traditions of invoice payments or merchant demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. The company initially believed that the US and UK, with their high credit card penetration, would not require their service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>.

However, a small team dispatched to the UK around 2015 identified a "huge opportunity" for BNPL, particularly in small ticket items like fashion, contrary to the CEO's initial belief that only high-ticket financing (like Affirm's approach) would be viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This was a critical insight, later mirrored in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

## Identifying Key Opportunities

The shift in the US market was largely attributed to a new generation of card users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>:
*   **Rise of Debit Cards** Debit card usage grew 10x between 2007 and 2018, significantly outpacing credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Many consumers either didn't have access to credit cards or disliked using them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   **"Self-Aware Avoiders"** A 2014 McKinsey report titled "New Frontiers in credit card segmentation tapping unmet consumer needs" identified a group of US consumers (estimated at 20% of the population) called "self-aware avoiders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. These individuals had poor experiences with credit cards, disliked practices promoting over-indebtedness (e.g., high credit limits, low minimum payments), and often saw their parents struggle with debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. They sought:
    *   Simple and transparent fees, rates, and terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
    *   Avoidance of mishaps that trigger fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
    *   A clear payoff horizon for each major purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
    *   Swipe-to-installment loan options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **High-Income Avoiders** Interestingly, this group often had "fairly high median annual household incomes" and spent significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Consumer Preference for Structured Credit** BNPL systems offered a more structured payment plan, with clear upfront terms, which appealed to consumers wanting to avoid uncontrolled revolving debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Reintroduction of "Pay Now" Option** Klarna's strategy involves reintroducing the choice between paying now (debit) or paying later (credit), akin to older payment terminals, which promotes healthier spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and [[competition_and_market_dynamics_in_the_payment_industry | Competition]]

Upon entering the US market in summer 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, Klarna faced intense [[competition_and_market_dynamics_in_the_payment_industry | competition]]:
*   **Afterpay's Momentum** Afterpay, a company from Australia, gained significant momentum in the US, notably by signing Urban Outfitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. This established Afterpay as an early market leader, making it challenging for Klarna to win merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
*   **Shopify's Dominance** Shopify's decision to develop its own checkout and become a fintech company blocked a key entry point for Klarna's checkout services into the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **Incumbent Criticism** Klarna faces criticism, partly from traditional banks and incumbents who see BNPL as a "major threat to their existing Revenue lines" as it is a model that makes less money from its users and encourages less borrowing, which is better for consumers but not for a bank's traditional credit card portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This highlights a "major innovators dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Klarna's Strategy in the US

To gain traction against competitors and navigate the market, Klarna shifted its strategy:
*   **Consumer-Centric Approach** Realizing they couldn't immediately win on the merchant side, Klarna pivoted to win on the consumer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Browser and Virtual Cards** Klarna launched a browser within its app that allowed users to generate one-time virtual Visa cards to shop with Klarna "everywhere" online, even at retailers not directly integrated with Klarna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **SKU-Level Data** This browser experience allowed Klarna to collect SKU-level data on transactions, a competitive advantage over traditional credit card networks (Visa/Mastercard) that only provide amount and merchant name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This data provides deeper insights into consumer purchasing habits and enables more valuable services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   **Winning Perception** Klarna used its growing app download numbers (tracked by App Annie) to demonstrate consumer preference and win over merchants, arguing that consumers would choose a service usable everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This led to integrations with major retailers like Sephora and Macy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
*   **Global Scale** The US market is considered essential for achieving global scale in the payments and financial services industry, which is a trillion-dollar opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## Evolution and Future Outlook

Klarna's experience in the US market highlights the [[evolution_of_the_payments_landscape | changing nature of payments]] and consumer expectations. The company's vision extends to becoming a digital financial assistant, leveraging data (especially SKU-level data) to provide personalized advice and services to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This future relies on being global, having vast data, and using [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_monetization_and_business_models | AI]] to deliver value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

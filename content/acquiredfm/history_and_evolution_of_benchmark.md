Benchmark is a prominent venture capital firm, uniquely structured around the belief that venture capital does not scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>. Since its [[Founding of Benchmark Capital | founding in 1995]], the firm has consistently delivered outsized returns by investing in truly important technology companies across different generations of partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>.

## The Venture Capital Landscape in the 1990s

In the early 1990s, the venture capital ecosystem was dominated by a few established firms. Kleiner Perkins, particularly under the leadership of John Doerr, was considered the "800-pound gorilla" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Doerr had a remarkable track record, backing companies like Compaq, Intuit, Sun, Netscape, Amazon, and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Kleiner Perkins operated with a distinct style:
*   **Centralized Power:** John Doerr was the unquestioned leader, acting as CEO, top investor, and front office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. He would aggressively pursue deals but often tried to pass board seats to junior partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.
*   **Modern Keiretsu:** The firm embraced a "modern keiretsu" model, facilitating (and sometimes forcing) business development relationships among their portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. This was beneficial in an era where distribution was difficult to achieve organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.

Other notable firms at the time included Sequoia, Greylock, Venrock (the venture arm of the Rockefeller family), and IVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

### Pre-Benchmark Origins

Two firms, Technology Venture Investors (TVI) and Merrill Pickard Anderson & Eyre (MPAE), shared an office building at 2480 Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>. This location was the original office of Forethought, the company that developed PowerPoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>.

*   **TVI:** Famously the sole venture capital investor in Microsoft, investing $1 million for 5% of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. Dave Marquardt was a key figure at TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. Marquardt held a philosophy that venture business is intensely personal and doesn't scale, and that VCs should support founders rather than provide "value-added services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>.
*   **MPAE:** Had successful investments in companies like Palm Pilot and Rambus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:57">[01:31:57]</a>.

Both TVI and MPAE faced internal discussions about their future structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. Older general partners (GPs) had made significant money, and junior partners felt undercompensated and lacking in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. This tension stemmed from the typical venture firm structure where founding partners owned the management company (which received fees) while junior partners only received a share of the fund's carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. TVI ultimately decided to "declare victory" and cease operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>.

## The Founding of Benchmark

The desire for a new, more equitable model fueled the creation of Benchmark.

### The First Generation of Partners

*   **Bob Kagle:** A partner at TVI, Kagle grew up in Flint, Michigan, and was the first in his family to attend college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>. He had a "religious fervor" for equal partnership, believing anything else was morally wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>. After TVI closed, Kagle approached Bruce Dunleavy to start a new firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>.
*   **Bruce Dunleavy:** A partner at MPAE, Dunleavy had a different background, studying English literature at Rice University before working at Goldman Sachs and then joining MPAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:18">[01:31:18]</a>. He had invested in Palm Pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:59">[01:31:59]</a>. While intrigued by Kagle's proposal, he felt they needed more partners for viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>.
*   **Andy Ratcliffe:** Dunleavy's colleague at MPAE, he shared the belief in equal economics and joined Kagle and Dunleavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>.
*   **Kevin Harvey:** An entrepreneur who had sold two companies (one to Apple, one to Lotus), Harvey was recruited by Dunleavy to bring entrepreneurial DNA to the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>.
*   **Val Vaden:** A fifth founding member, Vaden came from a software buyout background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:31">[01:39:31]</a>.

The firm chose the audacious name "Benchmark Capital," signaling their aspiration to "set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. Their first fund, "Benchmark Fund One," launched in late 1994, sought a premium 30% carry (compared to the industry standard 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:16">[01:41:16]</a>. This non-consensus approach drew mixed reactions; Horsley Bridge made a significant early commitment, but Stanford University famously "blackballed" the firm, organizing other endowments against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:21">[01:47:21]</a>. The firm's prospectus for Fund One featured the quote, "There is always room at the top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>. They also gave prospective LPs a copy of Jim Collins' book "Built to Last" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>.

After raising an $85 million fund, Benchmark faced a rocky start. Val Vaden's buyout-focused investment style didn't align with the firm's early-stage technology focus, and he departed at the end of 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:22">[01:51:22]</a>. The firm provided a generous separation, even keeping him listed on their website with a description of his new fund focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:58">[01:53:58]</a>.

To re-inject "swagger," Benchmark recruited **David Beirne**, a top executive recruiter, in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Beirne, known for his relentless hustle and bold claims, had built Ramsay Byrne into a leading tech executive search firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>. He left a lucrative cash-based business to join Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

## Benchmark's First Major Success: eBay

Beirne's arrival coincided with a renewed aggressive approach. His first major deal was likely Webvan, an ambitious online grocery and "everything store" founded by Louis Borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:44">[02:02:44]</a>. Benchmark co-led the $7 million Series A with Sequoia, investing $3.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:09">[02:06:09]</a>. While Webvan later became a symbol of dot-com excess, it represented a smart, high-risk, high-return venture bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:37">[02:03:37]</a>.

A pivotal moment for Benchmark was the investment in **eBay**. Pierre Omidyar, an engineer with a background in pen computing, had started eBay (originally "Auction Web") as a side project while working at General Magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:50">[02:11:50]</a>. Users began sending checks to his apartment to cover server costs, demonstrating immense product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:57">[02:14:57]</a>.

Despite its clear traction, most other VCs turned down eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:32">[02:16:32]</a>. Benchmark, leveraging Bruce Dunleavy's existing relationship with Omidyar from a previous investment, and recognizing the consumer market potential, saw the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:40">[02:16:40]</a>. The entire partnership—Bob Kagle (consumer focus), David Beirne (executive recruitment), Kevin Harvey, and Andy Ratcliffe—worked together to win the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a>.

In June 1997, Benchmark invested $6.7 million in eBay's Series A at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>. Notably, this deal potentially included a secondary component, where some of the investment took the form of equity-backed loans to Omidyar and Jeff Skoll (eBay's first business hire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:07">[02:20:07]</a>. This likely incentivized them to reject a $50 million acquisition offer from Knight Ridder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:35">[02:18:35]</a>.

Benchmark also played a crucial role in recruiting Meg Whitman from Hasbro as eBay's CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>. When eBay went public in September 1998, Benchmark's stake was worth $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:14">[02:23:14]</a>. By the time their lockup expired in Spring 1999, that stake had soared to over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:31">[02:23:31]</a>. This single investment alone provided a 47x return on their $85 million fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:50">[02:23:50]</a>, making Fund One one of the best-performing venture funds in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. The success of eBay also meant assistants at Benchmark became millionaires due to their share of the fund's carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>.

## The Imperial Era: Experimentation and Challenges (1999-2005)

After eBay's success, Benchmark became a top-tier firm, inundated with opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:40">[02:54:40]</a>. The firm debated how to proceed: should they scale up, adopt joint ventures with large corporations, or stick to their original boutique model? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:50">[02:56:50]</a>.

Contrary to their current reputation for focus, Benchmark, despite its initial core principles of not scaling, embarked on a period of aggressive expansion:
*   **Fund Size:** They raised a billion-dollar Fund Four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57">[02:59:57]</a>.
*   **International Expansion:** They expanded to Europe (raising a $750 million fund, later cut to $500 million) and Israel (a $220 million fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:27">[03:00:27]</a>. Bruce Dunleavy even moved to London for a year to set up the European operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:27">[03:00:27]</a>. These international entities were structured as separate partnerships that "rented" the Benchmark brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:17">[03:19:17]</a>.
*   **Corporate Network:** They created a "corporate network" to facilitate strategic partnerships between their portfolio companies and large corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Investment Scope:** They even made a late-stage mezzanine investment in 1-800 Flowers, which was not a typical early-stage technology deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:35">[02:59:35]</a>.

This period, however, was marked by "sins of omission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>. Benchmark missed out on investing in generational companies like:
*   **Google:** Despite Bill Gurley hearing about and meeting with them, Benchmark "failed to pursue" the opportunity with their characteristic hyper-competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:40">[03:02:40]</a>.
*   **Skype:** While they had a European fund, the deal was lost due to internal handoffs and conflicting responsibilities between the US and European teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.
*   **Facebook:** Benchmark was conflicted out due to an existing investment in Friendster, a competing social network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:50">[03:13:50]</a>.

These missed opportunities, coupled with internal pressures and questions about the firm's direction, led to a realization that their diversified strategy was detracting from their core strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:04">[03:27:04]</a>.

### The Return to Core Principles

Around 2004-2005, a refocusing began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:26">[03:30:26]</a>. Kevin Harvey notably advocated returning to focusing on early-stage investments in California, divesting from the international expansions and corporate partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:04">[03:27:04]</a>. The European and Israeli operations spun off to become Balderton Capital and Pitango Venture Capital (formerly Benchmark Capital Israel), respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

The first wave of retirements from the original partners happened during this period, including David Beirne and Andy Ratcliffe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:02">[03:31:02]</a>. Crucially, they adhered to the founding principle of clean transitions, stepping back entirely and taking no "tail economics" from future funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:50">[03:31:50]</a>.

## The Fab Four Era (2006-2017)

With a core group of Bruce Dunleavy, Bob Kagle, Kevin Harvey, and now **Bill Gurley**, Benchmark began to rebuild. Gurley, who had joined in 1999, was a former Wall Street analyst and prolific writer known for his "Above the Crowd" newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:54">[03:05:54]</a>. He had a "Calvinist work ethic" and a deeply analytical approach to marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>.

The firm's recruitment strategy shifted to bring in "All-Stars" who were already established VCs but still early enough in their careers to commit fully to the equal partnership model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:55">[03:41:55]</a>.

The "Fab Four" era solidified with the addition of:
*   **Peter Fenton:** Joined from Accel, a firm that had just invested in Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:03">[03:43:03]</a>. Fenton was known for being ahead of other VCs in finding new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:40">[03:44:40]</a>. He had a track record of early wins and made a significant commitment by leaving his existing economics at Accel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:57">[03:46:57]</a>. His investments include Twitter, Docker, and New Relic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:51">[03:47:51]</a>.
*   **Mitch Laskey:** A former founder and CEO in the gaming industry (Jamdat Mobile, acquired by EA), Laskey brought an operational and gaming focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">[03:49:09]</a>. His key investments include Snap and Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:54">[03:50:54]</a>.
*   **Matt Cohler:** Employee #5 at Facebook and an early employee at LinkedIn, Cohler possessed an unparalleled understanding of consumer social products and psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:41">[03:52:41]</a>. He understood the impact of AWS and the shift to Series A investing based on data and traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:56">[03:53:56]</a>. Cohler famously stated, "Our job as venture capitalists is not to see the future but to see the present very clearly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:59">[03:52:59]</a>. His investments include Instagram and Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:55">[03:54:55]</a>.

This group achieved remarkable success, particularly with Fund Seven (raised $550 million in 2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>. This fund became one of the best-performing of its size, highlighted by investments in Uber, Snap, Discord, Stitch Fix, and Docker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:49">[03:56:49]</a>. Bill Gurley's investment in Uber, at a $60 million post-money valuation in 2011, became a significant driver of returns, with Benchmark's stake worth $8 billion by 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>.

The **Uber saga** represented both the peak and eventual challenge of this era. Initially, the relationship between Gurley and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. However, as Uber faced growing controversies (e.g., #DeleteUber, Susan Fowler allegations) and achieved unprecedented private market valuations, tensions rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Benchmark, holding a significant stake and facing immense pressure from its LPs, ultimately sued Kalanick to force his removal as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. While controversial, this move was seen by some as necessary to protect the company's value and ensure a path to IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:17">[03:06:17]</a>.

This public dispute, among other factors, contributed to the dissolution of the "Fab Four" era. Matt Cohler and Mitch Laskey stepped back from active partnership in Fund Nine, followed by Bill Gurley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:09">[03:10:09]</a>. Peter Fenton is the only remaining active GP from that generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:24">[03:10:24]</a>.

## The Current Generation of Benchmark

The current partnership at Benchmark continues the tradition of bringing in experienced, "All-Star" investors, often from operational backgrounds or other successful firms.

*   **Eric Vishria:** Joined in 2014, Vishria was previously VP of Marketing at Loudcloud/Opsware (working with Ben Horowitz) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:25">[03:12:25]</a>. He has led investments in Confluent, Amplitude, and Benchling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:08">[03:12:08]</a>.
*   **Sarah Tavel:** Joined in 2017 as the first woman GP at Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:56">[03:12:56]</a>. She sourced Pinterest for Bessemer Venture Partners, then worked at Pinterest before joining Greylock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:08">[03:13:08]</a>. Tavel is known for her analytical approach to consumer and marketplace investing. Her first investment at Benchmark was Chainalysis, a non-consensus bet in the crypto winter of 2017-2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:50">[03:14:50]</a>.
*   **Chethan Puttagunta:** Joined in 2018, Puttagunta came from NEA and had a strong track record in enterprise software, with investments in Elastic, Mulesoft, and MongoDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:49">[03:17:49]</a>.
*   **Miles Grimshaw:** The most recent addition, Grimshaw joined in 2021 from Thrive Capital, where he was involved with companies like Benchling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:37">[03:18:37]</a>.

The current Benchmark partnership is Peter Fenton, Eric Vishria, Sarah Tavel, Chethan Puttagunta, and Miles Grimshaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:32">[03:19:32]</a>.

## Benchmark's Unique Model and Enduring Powers

Benchmark's approach is characterized by several key elements:

*   **Equal Partnership:** All active general partners have equal carry and shared ownership of the management company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:41">[02:26:41]</a>. This fosters a culture of deep trust and teamwork, as partners have no incentive to claim individual credit or widen gaps between themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:41">[02:26:41]</a>. It removes conflicts of interest common in traditional VC structures where junior partners might prioritize their own portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. However, this model only works if every partner consistently brings "all-star" effort and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:50">[02:45:50]</a>.
*   **Small Fund Size & Focus:** Benchmark intentionally keeps its funds relatively small (e.g., $85M for Fund One, $550M for Fund Seven) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:29">[02:57:29]</a>. This "boutique by design" approach means partners spend almost all their time on deal-making and supporting portfolio companies, rather than managing a large firm or worrying about career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:01">[03:20:01]</a>.
*   **Founder-Centric:** Benchmark partners act almost as co-founders to their portfolio companies, offering intense support and frequent communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:03">[02:51:03]</a>. Their philosophy is to avoid being a "value-added service" provider; instead, they empower founders to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>.
*   **Non-Consensus and Right:** A core tenet of Benchmark's investing, as articulated by partners like Andy Ratcliffe and Bill Gurley, is the need to be "non-consensus and right" to make money in venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:52">[03:15:52]</a>.
*   **Branding and Signal:** Benchmark's strong brand means its capital is highly valued. An investment from Benchmark often de-risks a company's next funding round, making it easier to attract subsequent capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:51">[03:33:51]</a>.
*   **Learning Culture:** The firm prioritizes continuous learning, exemplified by their [[Benchmark Dinner origins | famous Monday night dinners]] with prominent guests (e.g., Jeff Bezos, Michael Lewis) where they analyze their misses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:57">[03:39:57]</a>.

### Evolution of Investment Strategy

*   **Early Days (Seed/Startup):** In its founding, Benchmark focused on "seed and startup investments," meaning pre-business plan or post-business plan but pre-traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:48">[02:10:48]</a>. This required making "people bets" and taking significant product risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:33">[02:10:33]</a>.
*   **Shift to Series A:** With the rise of AWS and mobile, particularly during the Fab Four era, Benchmark recognized a "mispricing" in Series A rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>. They shifted to investing at the point of traction or product-market fit, especially for consumer companies, allowing them to make data-driven decisions on already working products like Instagram or Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>. For B2B/Enterprise, they remained willing to do seed investments, particularly for repeat entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:10">[02:11:10]</a>.
*   **Marketplace & Consumer Expertise:** Bill Gurley's focus on marketplaces and Matt Cohler's insights into consumer social products were pivotal during the Fab Four era, aligning with the major trends of the mobile internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>.

Benchmark continues to adapt its strategy, constantly balancing its core principles with the evolving technology landscape. Its history is a testament to the power of a deeply aligned, small, and highly focused partnership.

The story of [[pronunciation_and_cultural_significance_of_porsche | Porsche]] is deeply intertwined with that of Volkswagen, a relationship marked by shared origins, dramatic power struggles, and enduring collaboration. Despite [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]]'s status as a luxury brand, its history is inextricably linked to the "people's car" [00:00:56].

## Early Origins and [[porsche_and_nazi_connections | Nazi]] Connections

The individual at the heart of this connection is Ferdinand [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]], an Austrian automotive engineer [00:05:41]. After a two-decade career as chief engineer at Daimler, which would later merge to form [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Mercedes-Benz]] [00:08:06], Ferdinand left in 1929 following a dispute over his vision for a small, affordable car [00:09:21].

In 1931, he established his own consulting firm, "Dr. Ing. h.c. F. [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] Konstruktionen GmbH," which marked the beginning of the [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] company [00:10:00]. This firm was founded with the financial support of his son-in-law, Anton Piëch, and a Jewish businessman named Adolf Rosenberger, who was later arrested by the Gestapo and had his stake appropriated by [[porsche_and_nazi_connections | Nazis]] [00:11:14].

A pivotal moment came in 1934 when [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] secured a contract to design his "car for the people" [01:12:29]. This project was initiated by Adolf Hitler, who established Volkswagen specifically for this purpose [01:12:41]. This car became the iconic Volkswagen Beetle [01:13:38]. The city where Volkswagen was founded, Wolfsburg, was also created by Hitler [01:16:02]. Before World War II, only about 200 Beetle units were made before production shifted to military vehicles [01:16:26].

## Post-War Separation and Rebirth

After World War II, the Volkswagen operations were largely separated from [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] [01:17:00]. Wolfsburg fell under British control, and Major Ivan Hirst, a British officer, saved Volkswagen from being dismantled [01:19:18]. Despite initial British disinterest in the Beetle design [01:19:57], Hirst recognized its potential for German economic revitalization and ordered 20,000 Beetles for the British military, effectively restarting the company [01:20:16].

Meanwhile, Ferdinand [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] and Anton Piëch were arrested by the French as war criminals, serving two years in prison [01:23:00]. Ferdinand's son, Ferry [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]], was released earlier [01:23:31]. Ferry and his sister Louise returned to Austria and began rebuilding the family business from a sawmill [01:24:25].

Volkswagen, under Hirst, approached the [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] family to reinstate their partnership [01:34:24]. A "sweetheart deal" was struck: the German [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] company (Ferdinand and Ferry's side) would provide technical design and consulting services to Volkswagen, receiving a royalty on every Beetle sold worldwide [01:35:05]. The Austrian [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] company (Louise and Anton's side) gained exclusive distribution rights for Volkswagens in Europe, becoming the largest car dealer network in Europe [01:36:10]. This arrangement provided a stable cash flow that allowed [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] to reinvest heavily in R&D and new models [01:44:00].

## Intertwined Developments and Power Struggles

The 1960s saw the development of the iconic [[legacy_and_brand_power_of_porsche | Porsche]] 911, which was originally intended to be the "901" but renamed due to a trademark conflict with Peugeot [00:58:22]. Ferdinand Piëch, Louise's son and Ferry's nephew, played a crucial role in designing the 911's six-cylinder boxer engine [00:57:43].

In 1967, [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] and Volkswagen began a joint project for a new mid-engined roadster, the 914 [01:07:25]. Although initially intended to have both Volkswagen and [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] branding, a new Volkswagen CEO decided all 914s would be [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]]s [01:08:26]. In return, Volkswagen took over all of [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]]'s distribution in America, a significant deal that effectively merged aspects of their operations [01:09:01].

Following an internal family summit in 1970, the [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] and Piëch families decided to completely exit the operational management of [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]], choosing to remain owners but not managers [01:16:08]. Ferdinand Piëch, feeling sidelined, left [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] to become the head of Audi, a brand he transformed into a legitimate competitor to [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Mercedes-Benz]] and BMW [01:19:20]. His success led to his promotion to CEO of Volkswagen in 1993, making him the head of the larger group that once included [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] [01:21:08].

## Near Collapse and Rebuilding

The 1980s and early 1990s were a challenging time for [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]], with declining sales and market capitalization [01:39:44]. The company cycled through several CEOs [01:41:35]. During this period of desperation, [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] even took on projects for other manufacturers, building the [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Mercedes-Benz]] 500E sedan and collaborating with Audi on the RS2 station wagon [01:42:17]. These projects, while unusual for [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]], literally "kept the lights on" in Stuttgart [01:43:37].

The turnaround began in 1993 with the appointment of Wendelin Wiedeking as CEO [01:50:25]. Wiedeking implemented the Toyota production system to improve efficiency and famously cut all product lines except for the 911 [01:51:27]. His strategy for an "entry-level [[legacy_and_brand_power_of_porsche | Porsche]]" was "a used [[legacy_and_brand_power_of_porsche | Porsche]]" [01:51:50].

Wiedeking's bold move to develop an entry-level model, the Boxster, which shared the front-end platform with the 911 (996 generation), proved highly successful [01:53:08]. This strategy provided a more affordable "true [[legacy_and_brand_power_of_porsche | Porsche]]" experience [01:54:13]. He then took the company into the SUV market with the Cayenne in 2002, a decision initially met with skepticism but that proved to be a massive success [01:57:08]. The Cayenne shared its platform with Volkswagen's Touareg [02:01:56]. This diversification, along with the launch of supercars like the Carrera GT and 918 Spyder, cemented [[legacy_and_brand_power_of_porsche | Porsche]]'s financial recovery and enhanced its brand [02:01:30]. Under Wiedeking, [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]]'s market cap grew from under 400 million Euros to 32 billion Euros by 2007 [02:08:29].

## The Unsuccessful Takeover and Modern Structure

In the mid-2000s, with a surplus of cash and German tax laws incentivizing reinvestment over profit distribution, Wiedeking conceived a daring plan: [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] would acquire Volkswagen [02:12:59]. In September 2005, [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] spent $4 billion to acquire 20% of the Volkswagen Group [02:15:42]. They continued to buy shares, largely through derivatives, to circumvent the "Volkswagen Law," which limited voting rights to 20% regardless of shareholding and protected VW from hostile takeovers [02:16:01].

By 2007, [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] had acquired over 50% of Volkswagen through a newly created holding company, [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] SE, funded by $10 billion in debt [02:17:36]. Ferdinand Piëch, still Chairman and CEO of Volkswagen, initially seemed to support the move, possibly to oust Volkswagen's then-current CEO [02:18:24].

However, the collapse of Lehman Brothers in October 2008 and the ensuing financial crisis created a short squeeze that temporarily made Volkswagen the most valuable company in the world [02:20:00]. This left [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] trapped: unable to sell its highly valued Volkswagen shares to service its debt (as it would crash the stock) and unable to buy more [02:21:34]. Piëch seized the opportunity, publicly declaring [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] financially unviable and offering a bailout: Volkswagen would acquire the [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] operating company [02:22:42].

By January 2009, Wiedeking was ousted [02:24:13]. Volkswagen acquired [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] AG in two tranches for approximately 8.5 billion Euros [02:24:32]. In a final twist of family drama, the [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] and Piëch families, through [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] SE, emerged as the largest shareholders of the Volkswagen Group, controlling over 50% of its voting power [02:25:08]. Thus, while Volkswagen technically bought [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]], the families ultimately gained control of the larger automotive conglomerate [02:26:10].

Today, [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] operates as part of the Volkswagen Group, sharing platforms and components across various brands [02:34:56]. Volkswagen Group's CEO, Oliver Blume, also serves as [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]]'s CEO, underscoring their intertwined nature [02:42:50]. Despite producing mass-manufactured vehicles (over 350,000 cars annually [02:45:32]), [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] maintains its position as a premier luxury brand with strong pricing power, comparable to [[rolex_brand_history_and_its_evolution | Rolex]] or [[herms_branding_and_marketing_strategies | Louis Vuitton]] rather than [[herms_branding_and_marketing_strategies | Hermès]] (Ferrari) [02:45:58].

In September 2022, [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] was re-IPOd, becoming the largest European IPO of all time, unlocking significant value by allowing investors to own a pure-play luxury automotive stock [02:40:12]. This financial separation, however, does not diminish the operational and historical ties that continue to bind [[history_and_founding_of_porsche | Porsche]] and Volkswagen [02:41:11].

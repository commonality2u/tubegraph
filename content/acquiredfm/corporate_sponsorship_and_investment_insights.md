## Acquired's Approach to Sponsorships and Growth

The podcast "Acquired" has developed a distinctive approach to corporate sponsorships and business growth, emphasizing deep relationships and strategic trade-offs over maximizing immediate revenue or audience size.

### Sponsor Engagement
Acquired works with a select group of sponsors, focusing on long-term, season-long partnerships, typically six months in duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. This deliberate choosiness allows them to build deep relationships with their sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. They view their sponsors as partners and "amazing companies," aiming to build relationships as deep as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. Unlike many media businesses, "Acquired" hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal directly manage sponsor relationships, interacting with company CEOs themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. This direct engagement fosters trust and allows for "first-party insights" that enrich the podcast's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:27">[01:58:27]</a>.

The sponsorship model is a "big freaking commitment" for both parties, given the podcast's audience of over 250,000 monthly active listeners, comprising CEOs, founders, engineers, and capital allocators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.

Key aspects of their sponsor strategy:
*   **Long-term contracts**: Six-month season-long sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
*   **Selectivity**: Ridiculously choosy about partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.
*   **Direct Relationships**: Hosts communicate directly with sponsor CEOs, avoiding agencies or dynamic ad insertion networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.
*   **Content Integration**: Aim to go beyond high-level pitches, integrating key insights and storytelling about the sponsor's business into the segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>.
*   **Beyond Sponsorship**: Seeking opportunities to deepen relationships through means such as hosting private events for sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.

This strategy leads to a "meaningfully better business" model for the podcast, even if it means not pursuing every potential revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. The business is "probably still unoptimized" but grows directionally with the audience and in other ways, such as direct [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.

### Strategic Trade-offs and Business Philosophy
"Acquired" embraces a philosophy of strategic trade-offs, prioritizing depth and quality over volume and broad appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. This includes:
*   **Limited Content Release**: Not releasing content weekly, which goes against typical podcast growth algorithms, but allows for "really, really deep research" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
*   **Long Episodes**: Producing very long episodes, which might alienate some listeners but is deeply appreciated by dedicated fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.
*   **No Spinoffs or Additional Hosts**: Maintaining a "purist organization" with only the two hosts to preserve the show's identity and avoid diluting the "Acquired" brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.
*   **Audience Focus**: Maintaining their "high-quality" audience mix of decision-makers rather than solely chasing audience growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.
*   **Evergreen Content**: Focusing on creating "evergreen pieces that sort of stand the test of time" rather than real-time news commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This means they are selective about topics, opting out of covering ongoing "drama" like the FTX or Twitter sagas because they felt they couldn't add new insight or avoid a "TMZ story" feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

These choices are rooted in a belief that "strategy is about trade-offs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. While some decisions might limit immediate revenue, they align with the hosts' vision for the show and their desire to build meaningful relationships. The hosts also leverage their experience as venture capitalists and business people to provide unique insights into their content, which they believe makes it better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:27">[01:58:27]</a>.

### Direct Investment from the Show's Community
A notable evolution in "Acquired's" business model is the direct [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]] into companies that sponsor the show. In 2022, they raised almost $10 million for Vanta, largely sourced from the "Acquired" audience community through an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>. This demonstrates how the show's engaged audience and deep sponsor relationships can translate into new forms of [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | capital allocation]].

The hosts have personally invested "small amounts" in their sponsors before, gaining insights into their businesses and audience resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. This has led to the broader "Kindergarten" initiative, allowing the community to participate in later-stage growth rounds for successful companies. This strategy of leveraging the community for [[insights_into_investing_and_business_development | investment]] is a testament to the trust and engagement built through the podcast.

## Insights into Companies and Markets

### The Internet's Impact on Demand and Niche Markets
The internet has fundamentally changed markets, enabling both massive scale for mainstream acts and the existence of thriving niche products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Taylor Swift serves as a prime example of an "internet Rockstar," whose demand for concert tickets far outstrips capacity, illustrating how digital distribution can amplify reach and touchpoints beyond what was possible in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Similarly, niche products like "Acquired" or Ben Thompson's "Stratechery" have audiences larger than previously imaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This expanded reach means that even focused content can find a substantial audience.

### Applied Technology Companies
Walmart is highlighted as an example of an "applied technology company" that transformed an existing sector (retail) by leveraging technology, specifically in supply chain coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. This technological application led to significant operational efficiencies, lower cost structures, and better margins, enabling them to offer lower prices and reach more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. The discussion differentiates between businesses where the technology *is* the business versus those that use technology to transform an existing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.

### The Evolution of Security and Compliance
Vanta's CEO, Christina Cassiopo, explains that security and compliance have evolved from mere "check the box" defense to an "offense" for B2B companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Proving security has become "table stakes" for B2B companies, even for early-stage startups raising seed rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Compliance reports help companies unlock new markets (international, enterprise, healthcare, regulated industries) and are crucial for revenue growth from "secure trusted sources" in the current funding environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Larger companies recognize they are "only as secure as their vendors" and thus demand higher security expectations from their partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Innovation in Established Markets
Brex is presented as a company with "two massive innovations" in an established market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>. They started by providing corporate cards for startups with modern UI and flexible underwriting, addressing a gap where traditional banks were hesitant to serve venture-backed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. Their second innovation is in spend management for large enterprises, offering built-in compliance and controls at the start of the spending process, rather than after expenses are incurred. This pre-approval system, leveraging algorithms, significantly reduces administrative overhead and saves time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>. This [[case_studies_of_successful_and_challenging_investments | case study]] exemplifies how companies can innovate twice within their domain to serve different customer segments.

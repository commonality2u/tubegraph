Rigidity can be a significant obstacle to profitability in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This principle became evident during the early days of [[introduction_to_junk_bonds|high-yield bond]] investing.

## Early Forays into High-Yield Bonds

Initially, the speaker transitioned to the bond department at Citibank, which was considered a "backwater" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. They were tasked with understanding [[introduction_to_junk_bonds|high-yield bonds]] and starting a fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This area was widely shunned, with most investment organizations having strict rules against buying bonds rated below A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The speaker, however, began buying single B bonds, defying the prevailing sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The absence of other bidders in such auctions was often an indicator of a good opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, underscoring the importance of open-mindedness and evolving one's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Historical Perspective: Milken's Insight

Mike Milken, who graduated from Wharton in 1969—the same year the speaker graduated from Chicago—had an early interest in low-rated bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. His key insight came from a famous book by Hickman, which analyzed bond performance from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Hickman's research revealed that the lower a bond's rating, the higher its *actual* total rate of return, not just its promised yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Despite defaults and bankruptcies, even during the Great Depression, the excess yield offered by these bonds was more than sufficient to offset credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This was Milken's "aha moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

At that time, it was almost impossible to issue low-rated bonds, which were often termed "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Big banks and investment banks avoided them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Moody's manual even defined a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, explicitly stating in 1978 that such bonds were "not proper for investment regardless of price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Managing Risk in High-Yield Bonds

The speaker illustrates the approach to [[investment_strategies_for_high_yield_bonds|investing in high-yield bonds]] with an analogy to life insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>:

*   **Awareness of Risk**: Just as life insurance companies know everyone will die, investors in high-yield bonds are aware of potential defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Analysis of Risk**: Risks are analyzed (e.g., a doctor examining a life insurance applicant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Diversification of Risk**: Risks are diversified, not concentrated (e.g., insuring various demographics, not just skydivers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Compensation for Risk**: The investor is well-paid to take the risk, with the bond's yield providing a premium for the perceived danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

By applying these principles, the speaker's fund made money steadily and safely by [[investment_strategies_for_high_yield_bonds|investing in what were considered the "worst public companies in America"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Contrast with the "Nifty Fifty"

This approach stood in stark contrast to the prevailing investment philosophy of the late 1960s, exemplified by the "Nifty Fifty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The Nifty Fifty were considered the best and fastest-growing companies in America, believed to be immune to negative events and worth any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

The Nifty Fifty represented the polar opposite of high-yield bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>: for the Nifty Fifty, no price was too high; for high-yield bonds, no price was low enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Both stances were flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Many Nifty Fifty companies, such as IBM and Xerox, faced significant challenges or lost market share due to disruption, despite being perceived as invulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Companies like Simplicity Patterns, once part of this elite group, also declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Investors who bought the Nifty Fifty in 1969 and held for five years often lost almost all their money because these stocks were priced too high, with P/E ratios ranging from 60 to 90, compared to the S&P's typical 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Many experienced losses exceeding 90% from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

This comparison highlights that perceived risk and actual risk, as well as price, are critical factors in investment success. The willingness to explore undervalued, perceived "risky" assets like [[introduction_to_junk_bonds|junk bonds]] can lead to significant returns, while overpaying for "safe" assets can result in substantial losses.

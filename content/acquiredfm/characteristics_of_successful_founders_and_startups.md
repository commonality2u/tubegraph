Successful founders and startups exhibit a blend of personal alignment, strategic adaptability, and exceptional judgment. These qualities are crucial not only for [[impact_of_market_conditions_and_founding_strategies_on_company_growth | company growth]] but also for navigating the inherent uncertainties of the venture world.

## Personal Alignment and Enjoyment
A foundational principle for success, whether in investing or founding a company, is to align one's strategy with personal demeanor and strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It's advisable to seek something that leverages strengths, avoids weaknesses, and is enjoyable to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Doing what comes naturally leads to greater enjoyment, competitive advantage, and durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Choosing a path solely for more money, if it doesn't bring enjoyment, is considered a "world-class mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Learning, Evolution, and Comfort Zones
Continuous learning and evolution are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While it's important to find what suits you, one cannot get too "hung up" in a comfort zone and ignore opportunities that fall outside it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Warren Buffett, for instance, is critiqued for largely ignoring [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_venture_capital_and_startups | technology]], which became pervasive, possibly because it was outside his comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, many technology companies succeed not just from cutting-edge science but from business "moats" similar to non-tech businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## The Conundrum of Investing and Founding
There's a dichotomy in investing and founding:
*   **Stick to your strengths** and what fits you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Be open-minded and willing to change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Investor Traits
Successful investors require a balance of traits:
*   **Confidence**, to back iffy ideas and stick with them through downturns, even buying more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   But **not so confident as to be "pig-headed"** and throw good money after bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Concentration** of holdings to make good ideas impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Diversification** to protect against unforeseen circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

These judgments cannot be reduced to an algorithm, highlighting the value of human intuition and qualitative assessments, especially concerning the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Computers are not yet capable of identifying the next "Amazon" or "Steve Jobs" from initial plans or meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## The Origin of Judgment
Judgment is key in fields where a credible argument can be made for opposing sides, leading to being "stuck in the middle" without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. As Charlie Munger once said, "none of this is meant to be easy; anybody thinks it's easy is stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The important things are simple to describe but not easy to consistently execute better than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Superior judgment comes from "second-level thinking" – thinking differently and more correctly than the consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This includes deep knowledge, understanding frameworks, rationality (thinking logically, not emotionally), and intellectual humility (knowing one can be wrong and acknowledging what one doesn't know) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## [[hiring_and_building_organizational_culture_in_startups | Hiring and building organizational culture in startups]] and Evaluating Judgment
When [[recruitment_challenges_for_new_venture_firms | recruiting]], especially for roles that require significant judgment, evaluators look for:
*   **"Smart Eyes"**: Exceptional people who intuitively grasp what's important and can go beyond readily available quantitative information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Team Players**: Individuals who can collaborate, exchange ideas, and learn from peers, superiors, and subordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Lone wolves or "you eat what you kill" types are generally avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Importance of Founders in Venture Capital
For venture investment, the vast majority of the decision-making revolves around understanding and backing the right [[entrepreneur_and_venture_capitalist_relationship | founders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. When evaluating founders, it's crucial to delve into their story and background to understand *why* they made past decisions, as this provides a clearer insight into their judgment than prospective plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Effective evaluation of founders includes:
*   **Authenticity**: In contrast to standardized interview answers, a founder's past actions are difficult to fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Learning and Evolution**: Did they make decisions based on their own judgment, learn, and evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>?
*   **First Principles**: Do they make decisions based on fundamental principles and are willing to go against the herd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>?
*   **Passion and Deep Understanding**: Is their idea driven by passion and specific knowledge of a real problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>?

## The "Weirdo" Founder and Uncomfortable Idiosyncrasy
Successful founders often stand out as "weirdos"—individuals who are "four standard deviations from the mean" in some particular area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. While conventional success can come from being exceptionally good at following a map, startups often lack a clear roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Therefore, founders must be able to think for themselves, possess real conviction, and be willing to do things based on their own views rather than conventional wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

As noted in a memo titled "I Beg to Differ," exceptionality cannot come from doing what everyone else does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The advantage in complex fields like venture investing is that there's no simple algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The person who "sees differently and better" is the one who will win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. David Swenson of Yale's endowment emphasized the need to do things that are "uncomfortably idiosyncratic" to split from the pack and win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

Even with a seemingly perfect idea like Google's PageRank algorithm, a mediocre or conventionally talented person would likely fail to build a company like Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This is because building a company is hard, and if it's successful, others will compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. It requires exceptional people who can exhibit exceptional judgment, attract and retain other exceptional people, and possess all the qualities that define a great founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

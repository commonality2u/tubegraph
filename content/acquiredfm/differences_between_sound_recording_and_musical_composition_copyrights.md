From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence, each covering a different aspect of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Understanding these differences is fundamental to grasping how [[importance_of_copyright_in_music_licensing | music licensing]] works and the complex dynamics of [[artists_rights_and_music_ownership | artists' rights and music ownership]] within the industry. The primary purpose of copyright law, in general, is to spur innovation and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording)

The first type of copyright is the sound recording copyright, also known as a "master recording" or simply a "master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

*   **Definition**: This copyright covers the literal recording of the music as it was captured in the studio and can be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Ownership**: Traditionally, the master recording is owned by the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Reason for Label Ownership**: Labels historically take ownership of these masters in exchange for assuming the financial risk involved in betting on, distributing, and promoting an artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This model can be compared to the old-school Venture Capital industry, where investors would take a majority stake in a company for providing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Artist Royalties and Recoupment**: When an artist signs a distribution deal where a [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] fronts the money to make an album and subsequently owns the master, the artist's royalty stream is independently negotiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Typically, artists may only end up with 10-15% of the royalties, or up to 20-22% for very big artists, with the vast majority going to the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Recoupment**: Artists only begin to participate in these revenues after they have "recouped" the upfront advance provided by the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For example, if a label gives a $500,000 advance, the label keeps the first $500,000 generated from album sales or [[the_economics_of_music_streaming | Spotify streams]] before the artist receives their percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This model is akin to a VC preference stack on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Industry Structure**: The music industry is largely dominated by essentially three major labels, limiting options for aspiring stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This structure reflects a past era where significant capital investment was required for album production, radio promotion, and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This "predatory" deal structure for artists is often perceived as necessary for labels to offset the high failure rate of new artists, with the success of a few winners covering the investment in many who do not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)

The second type of copyright is the musical composition copyright, also known as the "publishing right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

*   **Definition**: This copyright covers the written lyrics and the melody of a song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It represents the "idea" of the song, something that could be put down on sheet music, even before it's performed or recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Ownership**: These rights are traditionally held by the songwriters themselves, often through their [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | music publishers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Role of Publishers**: [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | Music publishers]] deal with composition copyrights in a similar way that labels deal with masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Historically, publishers would take 50% of the royalties generated from the composition copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, today they take significantly less. For larger songwriters, it might be a fixed fee paid to the publisher for back-office services, meaning the songwriter effectively owns their own composition copyrights and can decide on [[challenges_and_strategies_in_music_licensing_for_fitness_brands | specific licensing purposes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Historical Power**: Before recorded music, [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | music publishers]] were incredibly powerful because the publishing rights (sheet music) were the major rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Since singers and songwriters were often not the same people, artists and record labels were at the mercy of publishers who owned the sheet music rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Co-Writers**: Songwriting credits and splits can be negotiated privately among co-writers and split in any way, such as 50/50, 90/10, or even a flat fee for a guest writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For some approvals requiring a publishing license, multiple co-writers may need to sign off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Interdependence and Veto Power

These two copyrights form the fundamental building blocks for all music use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Some uses of music require approval from only one of these copyrights, while other uses require both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   For use cases requiring both, whoever owns the sound recording (master) right and whoever owns the publishing right both hold a "veto right" on who can use the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   The splits and income generated from music can vary wildly depending on how the music is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Lockheed Martin is described as a critical piece of American infrastructure, serving as the nation's largest defense contractor and the federal government's largest contractor overall, receiving approximately $50 billion annually from American taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. While the company is essential for defense and its products often act as deterrents for peace, it fundamentally manufactures weapons designed for "overwhelming foreign and air superiority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The history of Lockheed Martin, formed from numerous predecessor companies, is marked by hardcore engineering and daring innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Early History and Foundation
The company that eventually became Lockheed Martin was originally two separate entities: Lockheed and Martin Marietta, which merged in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The first Lockheed company was founded in 1912 by Allen Loughead (later Lockheed) with his brother Malcolm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Malcolm Lockheed later invented the modern hydraulic brake system for automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. John Northrop, a co-founder of the second Lockheed company, went on to found Northrop (now [[analysis_of_modern_defense_contracting | Northrop Grumman]]), playing a major role in three of today's five defense prime contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

After early successes like the Vega airplane, favored by Amelia Earhart, the second Lockheed company was sold to the Detroit Aircraft Corporation (DAC), which aimed to create the "General Motors of the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This vision failed because aviation did not become a consumer industry like automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. DAC went bankrupt after the 1929 stock market crash, and the Lockheed division was sold for $40,000 to Robert Gross, marking the true founding of the modern Lockheed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Under Robert and Cortland Gross, Lockheed built the iconic Electra airplane, notably featured in the movie *Casablanca* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

During World War II, Lockheed adapted the Electra into the Hudson bomber, selling 3,000 units to Britain's Royal Air Force before the U.S. even entered the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Kelly Johnson designed the P-38 Lightning fighter, which became the U.S.'s elite, fastest, and most maneuverable aircraft during the war, with over 10,000 produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

## Skunk Works: Innovation and Secrecy
The renowned Skunk Works division was founded by Clarence "Kelly" Johnson, an engineering prodigy who joined Lockheed in 1933 at age 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Johnson was known for his intuitive grasp of complex physics problems and was described as being able to "see the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

At the end of World War II, with the emergence of German jet fighters like the Messerschmitt Me 262, the U.S. government tasked Kelly Johnson and Lockheed with developing a jet fighter prototype within 180 days that could exceed 600 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Johnson selected 23 top engineers and 30 shop people, housing them in a circus tent next to a plastics factory in Burbank, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. The odor from the factory led to the informal name "Skunk Works," inspired by a popular comic strip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This team built the prototype U.S. fighter jet, the Lulu Bell (which became the P-80 Shooting Star), in just 143 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. The P-80, powered by a British Halford engine, became the first jet fighter plane in the U.S. military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

> [!info] Kelly Johnson's Skunk Works Rules
> Kelly Johnson established 14 rules for Skunk Works, emphasizing efficiency and focused effort. Key rules included:
> *   **Restricting personnel:** "The number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner. Use a small number of good people (10 to 25) compared to the so-called normal systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. These individuals should be co-located for collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
> *   **Managerial control:** "The Skunk Works manager must be delegated practically complete control of his program in all aspects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
> *   **Performance-based rewards:** Compensation should be "not based on number of personnel supervised," but on individual contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
> *   **Proximity to production:** Engineers and designers needed to be "only steps away from the shop workers to make quick structural or parts changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
> This focus on rapid delivery and superior products, driven by existential threats like World War II and the Cold War, allowed Skunk Works to bypass red tape and inspire immense pride and energy among its team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

### The U-2 Spy Plane
With the onset of the Cold War and the Soviet Union's detonation of its first nuclear bomb in 1949, intelligence became paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>. The U.S. needed to understand Soviet capabilities without provoking war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. The CIA turned to Skunk Works to develop an entirely new type of aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

The U-2 spy plane, operational from 1955 to 1989, was designed to fly at 70,000 feet, higher than any existing aircraft or Soviet radar detection capabilities at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. This required innovations in jet fuel (developed with Shell Oil) and a pressurized "spacesuit" for pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. The U-2 also needed a revolutionary camera system, which was developed by Dr. Edwin Land and Polaroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. Lockheed and Skunk Works completed the U-2 in about a year and a half for a total cost of $3.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

The U-2 was secretly tested at Groom Lake in Nevada, a remote dry lake bed previously used for nuclear tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. This site became known as Area 51, and the bizarre appearance of the U-2 and spacesuited pilots contributed to UFO rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>.

The first U-2 overflight of the Soviet Union occurred on July 4, 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>. The Soviets tracked it on radar from takeoff, revealing their advanced radar capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. However, they could not intercept it, as their fighter jets couldn't reach the altitude and their surface-to-air missiles couldn't hit the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>. For years, the Soviets remained silent about these overflights, as admitting they tracked the U-2 would also admit their inability to stop it, thus compromising their "posturing of strength" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. This intelligence was crucial for the U.S. in assessing Soviet nuclear capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. The U-2 program ended over Soviet airspace on May 1, 1960, when Francis Gary Powers' U-2 was shot down by a newly developed Soviet missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

## Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LMSC): Silicon Valley Connection
The intelligence gap created by the U-2 incident was secretly filled by Lockheed's new division, the Lockheed Missile Systems Division (later Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, LMSC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. This division's story is deeply intertwined with the birth of [[silicon_valleys_relationship_with_government_and_defense | Silicon Valley]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

During World War II, U.S. radar research was concentrated at MIT and Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. Frederick Terman, a Stanford Professor on loan to Harvard during the war, returned to Stanford after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. As Provost of Stanford, Terman recruited top experts to the university, revolutionized its technology transfer policies to encourage commercialization, and carved out university land to lease as commercial space, creating the Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.

Lockheed made the strategic decision in 1954 to start its new missile systems division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>. Recognizing the need for expertise in radar and computing (disciplines not strong in Southern California), Lockheed moved this division in 1955 to the Stanford Industrial Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>. Soon after, Lockheed also acquired 275 acres in Sunnyvale, building a massive campus with 137 buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. By the mid-1960s, LMSC employed 30,000 people, making it by far the largest employer in the burgeoning [[silicon_valleys_relationship_with_government_and_defense | Proto Silicon Valley]], dwarfing Hewlett-Packard's 3,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. Notably, Jerry Wozniak, Steve Wozniak's father, moved his family to Silicon Valley to work as an engineer at LMSC, directly influencing the region's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.

### Key Projects at LMSC: Polaris and Corona
LMSC undertook two historically significant projects:
1.  **Polaris Missile Program:** In 1955, the Navy contracted Lockheed to develop the Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) system, named Polaris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>. The challenge was to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles from submerged submarines, a feat considered nearly impossible due to stability issues and the need for rockets to thrust through water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>. This capability, achieved by 1960, revolutionized nuclear deterrence by making a first strike against land-based ICBMs irrelevant, as mobile, undersea nuclear strike capabilities (Polaris, Poseidon, Trident) guaranteed retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>.
2.  **Corona Satellite Program:** This secret U.S. space program, run by LMSC, developed an operational observational spy satellite system concurrently with early NASA missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>. The first Corona satellite launched in August 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:16">[01:33:16]</a>. It could photograph any ground location with a resolution as low as five feet from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>. The first Corona mission produced more photographic coverage of the Soviet Union than all previous U-2 flights combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:24">[01:34:24]</a>.

> [!info] Corona Film Recovery
> The Corona satellites used film systems, not digital photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:23">[01:35:23]</a>. To retrieve the images, the film was stored in a custom-designed "film bucket" (designed by General Electric) and dropped from orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>. After re-entering the atmosphere, a parachute would deploy, and the capsule was designed to be caught mid-air by a Lockheed C-130 airplane towing a "claw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:40">[01:36:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>. If missed, the capsule contained a salt plug that would dissolve after two days, sinking the film to prevent enemy capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>. This astonishing system, operational in 1960, was a pioneering achievement in space technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:03">[01:38:03]</a>.

Corona's success led to follow-up programs like Gambit (better resolution, under two feet by 1963) and Hexagon (longer orbit lifespans, more film capacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:14">[01:41:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:32">[01:41:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>. The KENNEN program, launched in 1977, was the first real-time space-based surveillance system, using digital photography beamed via ground link to stations, requiring Lockheed to build its own digital workstations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:20">[01:43:20]</a>. LMSC's pioneering work also contributed to weather satellites and the GPS system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:36">[01:44:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:04">[01:45:04]</a>. LMSC built the Hubble telescope, which was launched into space by the Space Shuttle (whose fuel tank was built by Martin Marietta) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:53">[01:45:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>.

From a business standpoint, LMSC became the "Crown Jewel" of Lockheed, often generating over 100% of the company's profits during difficult periods in the 1970s, keeping the company afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:56">[01:49:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>. LMSC's success was largely due to its focus on technology and computing problems, which offered better profit margins than building airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:39">[01:50:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. LMSC's operating philosophy, codified into seven tenets, emphasized "focus on a threat based need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:18">[01:52:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.

## Later Skunk Works & Stealth Technology
Despite the success of LMSC, Skunk Works continued its innovations. The [[development_and_significance_of_the_sr71_blackbird | SR-71 Blackbird]], a successor to the U-2, was designed to be so fast (Mach 3.4, over 2,000 miles per hour) that it couldn't be shot down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:05">[01:56:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:51">[01:56:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:43">[02:08:43]</a>. It flies at 84,000 feet, where the sky appears black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a>. Its skin reached 500 degrees Fahrenheit during flight, requiring it to be built almost entirely of titanium, a material new to aircraft construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:33">[02:01:33]</a>. Much of this titanium was secretly sourced from the Soviet Union via dummy corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>. The plane had "panel gaps" because its metal expanded significantly at high temperatures, causing fuel to leak on the ground until it reached operating speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:45">[02:03:45]</a>. The SR-71's engines used a "spike inlet system" that acted as a supercharger, providing three-quarters of the necessary thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:23">[02:05:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:21">[02:06:21]</a>. The SR-71, primarily a reconnaissance aircraft, never carried guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:36]</a>. Despite being shot at by over 4,000 missiles, none ever hit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:25">[02:09:25]</a>.

> [!info] The Blackbird's Stealth
> The SR-71 was also a pioneer in stealth technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:43">[02:11:43]</a>. Its flat bottom, unlike rounded fuselages, was designed to scatter radar waves away from the transmitter-receiver, making it difficult to detect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:24">[02:12:24]</a>. Rivets were made flush with the skin to avoid bouncing radar waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>. It took four years for the SR-71 to be detected by radar for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>.

In the mid-1970s, a Skunk Works mathematician, Dennis Rich, discovered a Russian paper containing equations that could make an aircraft almost completely invisible to radar, like a "BB on a radar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:19">[02:22:19]</a>. This led to the [[the_evolution_and_potential_of_defense_technology | F-117a Nighthawk]], the first true stealth fighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:17">[02:24:17]</a>. Its design, characterized by faceted, non-rounded surfaces (giving it the nickname "Hopeless Diamond"), was initially deemed unaerodynamic and uncontrollable by Kelly Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:13">[02:23:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:30">[02:24:30]</a>. However, Ben Rich, Kelly's successor as head of Skunk Works, risked his career to pursue the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:12">[02:26:12]</a>. The F-117a utilized "fly-by-wire" computer systems to enable control of its unstable design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:55">[02:29:55]</a>. The Air Force started taking delivery in 1983, buying 59 Nighthawks for $43 million each, providing much-needed revenue for Lockheed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:06">[02:30:06]</a>. The Nighthawk made its combat debut in Operation Desert Storm, where it accounted for 40% of all damaged targets while flying only 1% of air missions, demonstrating a "quantum advance in air warfare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">[02:30:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:01">[02:33:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Consolidation and the Modern Era
The end of the Cold War and the success of the U.S. military in the Gulf War led to a period of massive defense budget shrinkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:27">[02:34:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:15">[02:35:15]</a>. In July 1993, then-Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry called CEOs of major defense contractors to a "Last Supper" dinner, explicitly instructing them to consolidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:37">[02:35:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:02">[02:36:02]</a>. This unique government-mandated consolidation aimed to maintain America's military-industrial base despite a shrinking market, ensuring continued capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:47">[02:36:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:38">[02:37:38]</a>.

Following this, Lockheed acquired General Dynamics' fighter jet business (including the F-16) in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:52">[02:38:52]</a>. In 1994, Lockheed announced a "merger of equals" with Martin Marietta, which was finalized in 1995, forming Lockheed Martin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:58">[02:38:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. The combined entity continued to grow through acquisitions, including Loral's defense business for nearly $10 billion in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:25">[02:40:25]</a>. An attempt to merge with Northrop Grumman in 1997 was blocked by the Department of Justice to preserve competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:31">[02:40:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:47">[02:40:47]</a>. The competition for the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) program also led to Boeing acquiring McDonnell Douglas in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:20">[02:41:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:10">[02:42:10]</a>.

The F-22 Raptor program, initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 and F-16, saw its initial order of 750 planes for $44 billion revised down to 187 planes delivered, costing $62 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:11">[02:48:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:31">[02:48:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:30">[02:49:30]</a>. This meant each F-22 cost $360 million when amortizing R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:39">[02:49:39]</a>. The F-22, a highly advanced stealth fighter, demonstrated that modern computational power allowed for rounded, aerodynamic stealth shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:56">[02:50:56]</a>. Notably, Sega co-developed its Model 3 arcade board with Lockheed Martin to model stealth airplanes for video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:29">[02:51:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:31">[02:51:31]</a>. The F-22 program also involved 95,000 jobs spread across 46 states, illustrating the political dimension of defense contracting known as "pork barrel politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:01">[02:53:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:21">[02:53:21]</a>.

The F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program is the largest ever defense purchase for Lockheed Martin and its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:42">[02:57:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:49">[02:57:49]</a>. With an initial order book of approximately 3,000 airplanes and a potential total program cost of $200 billion, it's a massive undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:21">[02:56:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:26">[02:56:26]</a>. The F-35 focuses more on information-based warfare, with advanced communication and heads-up displays, rather than pure speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:36">[02:55:36]</a>.

Lockheed Martin's current segments include Aeronautics (F-35s, F-22s, F-16s, C-130Js), Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems (including Sikorsky helicopters), and Space (Orion Capsule, ULA joint venture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:44">[03:09:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:17">[03:10:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:20">[03:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:22">[03:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:25">[03:10:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:31">[03:10:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:34">[03:10:34]</a>. The F-35 program is the largest revenue generator, accounting for 20% of net sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:01">[03:10:01]</a>. Lockheed Martin's total revenue in 2022 was $66 billion, with $50 billion coming from the U.S. federal government, making it the single largest recipient of federal spending as a contractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:27">[03:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:30">[03:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:45">[03:01:45]</a>. Its net income margin is around 8%, reflecting a "cost-plus" contractual model where profits are contractually fixed over costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:51">[03:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>.

## [[analysis_of_modern_defense_contracting | Analysis of Modern Defense Contracting]] & Lockheed Martin's Role
The modern defense industry, exemplified by Lockheed Martin, operates in a unique environment where traditional market dynamics are largely absent.

> [!warning] Market vs. National Interest
> The defense industry does not function as a typical market. There is only one primary customer, the U.S. government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:20">[03:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:35">[03:15:35]</a>. The government's goal is not merely economic efficiency but maintaining the nation's military-industrial base and global dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:04">[03:21:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:26">[03:21:26]</a>. This leads to practices like government-mandated consolidation to prevent companies from failing and losing vital capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:07">[03:20:07]</a>.

Lockheed Martin, as a prime contractor, possesses "process power" due to its incredible ability as a systems integrator, coordinating thousands of subcontractors for complex projects like the F-35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:46">[03:15:46]</a>. This know-how, built over a hundred years, is a significant barrier to new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:24">[03:16:24]</a>.

The "cost-plus" contract model, while hated by investors for setting up terrible incentives, is deemed useful in defense because the exact cost of highly complex, critical projects is unknown upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:35">[03:02:35]</a>. However, this model prevents companies from achieving operating leverage, as profits are fixed percentages rather than benefiting from scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:56">[03:03:56]</a>.

A major critique of the modern military-industrial complex is its role as a "jobs program," where defense projects are funded partly because they create numerous jobs across many states, incentivizing congressional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:22">[03:21:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:05">[03:22:05]</a>. This contrasts with Eisenhower's 1961 farewell warning about the "acquisition of unwarranted influence" by the military-industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:49">[03:23:49]</a>.

> [!info] The Evolution of Defense Technology
> The **Skunk Works** approach emphasized rapid iteration, internal testing, and learning from failures, allowing for faster development on lower budgets, as seen with the U-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:47">[03:25:47]</a>. This mindset was directly transferred to [[silicon_valleys_relationship_with_government_and_defense | Silicon Valley]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:30">[03:33:30]</a>.

> In contrast, modern defense programs like the F-22 and F-35 are characterized by long timeframes (e.g., 25 years), massive costs, and piecemeal manufacturing across many subcontractors and even international allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:58">[02:52:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:53">[02:56:53]</a>. This approach makes **[[the_evolution_and_potential_of_defense_technology | innovation]]** slow and expensive, with costs per unit escalating as orders are cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:55">[02:59:55]</a>. This has led to concerns that eventually, the entire defense budget will only be able to purchase a single aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:08">[03:29:08]</a>.

While modern defense contractors like Lockheed Martin are incredibly protected and insulated businesses, the nature of **[[innovations_in_satellite_communications_and_defense_contracting | future warfare]]** is shifting towards software and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:26">[03:05:26]</a>. This poses a challenge, as the government's procurement methods are still geared towards hardware, making it difficult for software companies to engage with the defense industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:51">[03:04:51]</a>.

Ultimately, the U.S. government maintains its defense industrial base to ensure national security, often leveraging the human tendency to perform at their best in response to threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:57">[03:20:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:40">[03:31:40]</a>. While the Cold War era's existential threat spurred immense patriotic innovation, the motivation for today's defense sector is different, and the focus of such innovation may shift to new frontiers like cyber security or information warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:27">[03:30:27]</a>.

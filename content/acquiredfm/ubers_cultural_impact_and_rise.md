Uber has been a significant subject of discussion, notably featured in a special episode of *Acquired* podcast coinciding with its IPO in May 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The story of [[The rise and challenges of major tech companies and IPOs | Uber]] leading up to its IPO and subsequent "implosion" is depicted in the Showtime series *Super Pumped*, which premiered on February 27th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The adaptation of this [[The rise and challenges of major tech companies and IPOs | tech]] and venture story into pop culture is considered surreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## "Super Pumped" Series

The *Super Pumped* series features Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Travis Kalanick, the co-founder of Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The showrunners sought an actor who could project the intelligence needed to portray someone who could enlist many people in a "world-changing vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, while also being willing to depict unsavory or morally questionable actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The show aims to present a complex human portrayal of Kalanick, including both positive and negative aspects of his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

The series is based on Mike Isaac's book, and Isaac was actively involved in the writers' room, providing insights and sometimes even arranging direct conversations with sources for the show's creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. The series employs innovative storytelling techniques, including playing with form and disrupting storytelling conventions, which was seen as fitting given the story's subject matter of "disruption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. One notable technique involves depicting Kalanick's potentially apocryphal memories alongside the "real" events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

## Uber's Founding and Vision

One of the initial inspirations for Uber, according to the book and show, was Garrett Camp watching a scene in *Casino Royale* where James Bond summons his car with a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. While the famous "Eiffel Tower" founding story is a common anecdote, the show reveals it as an apocryphal narrative, showing the true story behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

Travis Kalanick is described as having "willed this thing into existence," overcoming stacked odds to create a service that was "unquestionably a better experience" than what existed before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. This highlights the transformative nature of Uber's creation.

## Cultural and Societal Impact

[[Ubers cultural impact and rise | Uber]] is seen as a prime example of a larger cultural trend where the *modus operandi* is "profits above all shareholder value up before everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This mentality prioritizes "growth growth growth" above all else, disregarding impact on individuals or feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. While not exclusive to Silicon Valley, this focus is particularly acute there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

The show aims to raise critical questions about "disruption and the cost, the price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, questioning whether the benefits of new utility and convenience are "worth what's on the other side of the ledger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. It also explores whether revolutionaries can avoid becoming "fascists" themselves once they unseat existing powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

The show's creators hope the audience will view the story as a "cautionary tale" rather than a glorification of certain behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. By showing the protagonist's "shortcomings and dark moments" unflinchingly, it seeks to reveal the emptiness and cost associated with extreme pursuit of power and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. The goal is to encourage empathy for individuals impacted by the system, such as a driver who was encouraged to buy cars and then had them towed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

The broader philosophical question raised is "what happens when companies are only incentivized by profit?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. This is presented as a systemic issue where mandatory exponential economic growth on a finite planet is inherently unsustainable, potentially leading to catastrophe unless the "grow or die" paradigm is changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

The semiconductor industry has undergone significant transformation and growth, driven by technological advancements, unique business models, and strategic partnerships. Its evolution has led to a highly specialized and interconnected global landscape.

## The Birth of the Pure-Play Foundry Model

Before the emergence of dedicated foundries, integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel and Texas Instruments (TI) handled both chip design and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:50">[02:20:50]</a>. However, the vision for a "fabless" model, where companies focused solely on design and outsourced manufacturing, began to emerge in the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a>.

Dr. Morris Chang, founder of TSMC, foresaw the rise of [[technological_advancements_and_supplier_impacts_in_semiconductors | fabless companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:40">[02:18:40]</a>. He observed this trend through early interactions, such as with Gordon Campbell, who sought funding for a company without building its own fabrication plant (fab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:33">[02:18:33]</a>. Another example was a company called ATM, which wanted General Instrument (where Chang worked) to produce wafers for them without owning a fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:01">[02:19:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:05">[02:19:05]</a>. This indicated the emerging demand for independent manufacturing services, which became the foundation of the [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | pure-play foundry business model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:06">[02:22:06]</a>.

## TSMC's Business Philosophy and Growth

TSMC was founded in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:47">[02:45:47]</a> with the core principle of being a dedicated pure-play foundry, meaning it would not compete with its customers by designing its own chips or end products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:04">[02:24:04]</a>. This philosophy, while initially seen as a niche, proved to be a critical competitive advantage, fostering strong customer trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:09">[02:24:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a>.

### The Learning Curve Theory

A fundamental aspect of TSMC's strategy is the application of the learning curve theory, which posits that as a company produces more of a product, its unit cost decreases due to increased experience and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:39">[02:03:39]</a>. This theory was refined by Dr. Chang during his time at Texas Instruments in collaboration with consultants from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Bill Bain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:52">[02:07:52]</a>.

For the semiconductor industry, this means:
*   **Volume is King** The goal is to become the largest volume player to achieve the lowest costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:58">[02:10:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Pricing** Companies might start with unprofitable prices in early stages of a new node to outcompete and gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:40">[02:38:40]</a>.
*   **Reinvestment** Aggregating demand allows for [[scale_economies_in_the_semiconductor_industry | economies of scale]] and reinvestment in the next generation of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:07">[02:11:07]</a>.

This strategy informs capital expenditure and R&D decisions, aiming to rapidly achieve high-volume production for new process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:59">[02:41:59]</a>.

## Key Partnerships and Challenges

TSMC's history is marked by crucial partnerships and significant challenges that shaped its trajectory.

### Nvidia Partnership

The relationship with Nvidia began in 1997 when CEO Jensen Huang, then leading a small company facing bankruptcy, directly contacted Morris Chang after their requests to TSMC's San Jose office went unanswered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Chang, irritated by his sales team's negligence, personally intervened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Nvidia's first successful chip, a gaming chip, not only saved the company but also made them a major TSMC customer within two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

A major challenge arose in 2009 with the 40-nanometer (nm) node, which suffered from manufacturing and quality issues, costing customers like Nvidia time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. After reassuming the CEO role in 2009, Chang addressed this problem as a top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. He personally met with Jensen Huang, eventually offering Nvidia a settlement of over $100 million to resolve the issue, which was accepted within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. This demonstrated the importance of strong personal relationships and fair resolution in maintaining long-term partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

### Apple Partnership and the 20nm Node

TSMC's decision to heavily invest in the 28nm node was a strategic move, considered a "sweet spot" in chip progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. This era coincided with the rise of smartphones, creating immense demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

In 2010, Apple's COO Jeff Williams approached TSMC, surprisingly requesting production on a 20nm nodeâ€”a half-step detour from TSMC's planned progression from 28nm to 16nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. This posed a significant financial and R&D challenge, as TSMC's resources were not yet sufficient to develop two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>.

Despite the complexities and the need to borrow billions of dollars, TSMC agreed to take on half of Apple's requested demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:29">[01:33:29]</a>. This decision was influenced by the belief that [[unusual_scale_economies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | 28nm was a sweet spot]], and while Apple's order wasn't part of the initial 28nm planning, it represented a significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>.

A temporary scare occurred when Apple paused discussions to consider Intel for manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:13">[01:37:13]</a>. However, Apple CEO Tim Cook ultimately explained that Intel "just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This highlighted Intel's historical arrogance and lack of customer-centricity compared to TSMC's willingness to courteously respond to requests, even irrational ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:14">[01:46:14]</a>.

The trade-off for pursuing the 20nm node for Apple was a delay in TSMC's 16nm development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>. This allowed Samsung to take an early lead in 16nm production, briefly receiving Apple's first 16nm orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>. However, TSMC quickly caught up, and eventually, most of Apple's 16nm requirements returned to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>.

### Qualcomm and IBM

TSMC actively pursued Qualcomm as a customer in the 1990s, recognizing them as a technology-focused company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:08">[01:56:08]</a>. Qualcomm initially gave little business, primarily using IBM as their foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:38">[01:57:38]</a>.
In the late 1990s (around 1997-1998), Qualcomm's business with TSMC rapidly increased, signaling that IBM's semiconductor business was in trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:48">[01:58:48]</a>. IBM then approached TSMC to co-develop the next generation of technology (0.13 micron/130nm) in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:46">[01:59:46]</a>. TSMC declined, knowing that co-development with IBM would mean losing control over their own process development and subordinating their engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:30">[02:00:30]</a>. IBM subsequently partnered with UMC, a peer in Taiwan, who later regretted the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:45">[02:01:45]</a>. This demonstrated TSMC's long-term strategic foresight and refusal to compromise its core model.

## [[The technological ecosystem in the semiconductor industry | The Semiconductor Ecosystem]]

The [[global_semiconductor_manufacturing_landscape | global semiconductor manufacturing landscape]] is highly integrated. TSMC's success is deeply rooted in the [[the_technological_ecosystem_in_the_semiconductor_industry | Hsinchu Science Park]] in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. This park acts as a concentrated "Silicon Valley," housing TSMC, its partners (like Cadence and Synopsis for Electronic Design Automation), customers (Qualcomm, MediaTek), and even two universities that feed PhDs directly into the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:04">[02:27:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:03">[02:28:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>. This geographic proximity facilitates extremely close communication and collaboration, essential for developing advanced nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:33">[02:29:33]</a>.

The establishment of such a park, particularly with government support, is considered one of the most successful government-funded industrial initiatives in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:06">[02:31:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:08">[02:31:08]</a>. The sheer scale of TSMC's facilities, such as the multiple phases of their 2nm process fabs, underscores the massive capital investment required in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:51">[02:31:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:24">[02:32:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:36">[02:32:36]</a>.

## Market Characteristics and Future Outlook

The semiconductor market exhibits characteristics of a natural monopoly, where the immense capital expenditure (currently around $20 billion for a new fab, potentially $100 billion in the future) for advanced manufacturing nodes means few players can compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:03">[02:42:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">[02:42:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:10">[02:42:10]</a>.

The industry's growth is fundamentally tied to the continued demand for computing power, a trend often referred to as "Moore's Law" (though its technical definition has evolved) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:31">[02:44:31]</a>. Since TSMC's founding in 1987, the world's semiconductor market has grown from $26 billion to $527 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:55">[02:45:55]</a>. This consistent demand provides a powerful incentive for continuous innovation and investment in supply side capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:32">[02:45:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:44">[02:45:44]</a>.

The rise of ARM's CPU architecture was another crucial factor in shaping the [[impact_of_tsmc_on_the_semiconductor_industry | modern semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:51">[02:24:51]</a>. ARM's dominance in mobile phones, and subsequently computers and servers, created an opportunity for a dedicated foundry specializing in ARM chips, diverging from the vertically integrated x86 world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:09">[02:25:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:02">[02:26:02]</a>. This facilitated the emergence of specialized companies across the value chain, including standalone architecture companies, large manufacturing companies, EDA (Electronic Design Automation) companies, and chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:04">[02:27:04]</a>.

The lead in the industry is further cemented by proprietary packaging technologies like CoWoS, used for AI chips, which makes it even harder for customers to dual-source manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:12">[02:43:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:21">[02:43:21]</a>. This suggests that those in the lead are likely to extend their advantage over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:38">[02:43:38]</a>.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has fostered crucial relationships with major technology companies like Nvidia and Apple, which have been pivotal to its growth and market leadership in the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These partnerships highlight [[tsmcs_partnerships_and_business_strategies | TSMC's business strategies]] and its unique "Pure Play Foundry" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:06">[02:22:06]</a>.

## Partnership with Nvidia

The relationship between [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] and Nvidia began with a letter from Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, to Morris Chang in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. At the time, Nvidia was a small, four-year-old company facing potential bankruptcy, with only about 50 to 60 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Jensen's letter expressed Nvidia's desire to do business with [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] after their San Jose office had not responded to their inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Morris Chang, then CEO of [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]], was intrigued and slightly irritated by the lack of response from his sales team, as he had always emphasized the importance of engaging with future customers, no matter how small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Chang met with Jensen in California, and Jensen impressed him with his articulateness and optimism, despite Nvidia's financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Jensen predicted that their new chip would not only save Nvidia but also make them a major [[tsmcs_partnerships_and_business_strategies | TSMC]] customer, potentially generating at least $50 million in annual revenue for [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This prediction came true; the successful game chip prevented Nvidia from going bankrupt and, within two to three years, Nvidia became one of [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s top five largest customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### The 40-Nanometer Node Challenge
The partnership faced a significant challenge in 2009 with the 40-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Development was slower than expected, causing manufacturing and quality problems for customers like Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. At this time, Morris Chang had stepped back from the CEO role, retaining only the chairmanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The then-CEO and quality director insisted [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] was not at fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Frustrated by the ongoing issues, Chang decided to retake the CEO position in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. One of his top priorities was resolving the persistent dispute with Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. He called major customers, including Jensen Huang, who seriously reminded him of the quality and manufacturing problems on the 40-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

Chang dedicated weeks to understanding and resolving the problem, which largely involved a monetary settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. About a month after returning as CEO, Chang emailed Jensen, inviting him to his home for salad and pizza, a tradition they had shared many times before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. Jensen asked when they would discuss business, and Chang set a time to move the discussion to Jensen's office after dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

Chang offered Nvidia a settlement exceeding $100 million, with a 48-hour deadline for acceptance before resorting to arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Jensen accepted the offer within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>. This resolution solidified their strong partnership, enabling billions of dollars in subsequent business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

## Partnership with Apple

The relationship between [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] and Apple began unexpectedly when Terry Gou, founder and CEO of Foxconn and a relative of Morris Chang's wife, arranged a dinner meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. Gou brought Jeff Williams, Apple's Chief Operating Officer, to Chang's home in Taipei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. This was in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.

Chang had been "thinking" about winning Apple's business, but knew Apple was a very "close-mouthed" company that only engaged when ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>. At the dinner, Jeff Williams immediately launched into his pitch: Apple wanted [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] to produce chips for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. Williams proposed a 40% gross margin for [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. Chang, whose target margin was 50% (and current was 45%), recognized this as a starting point rather than a concrete offer for negotiation at that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>.

A major surprise was Apple's request for 20-nanometer node technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] was about to begin production on 28-nanometer, and its next planned progression according to Moore's Law was 16-nanometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. The 20-nanometer node was a "half-step" or "detour" that [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] had not planned to invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. At the time, [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s R&D resources were not sufficient to develop two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. Accepting Apple's request meant a significant, unplanned capital expenditure of around $10 billion over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>.

To fund this, [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] decided to borrow money, issuing corporate bonds, rather than cutting dividends or selling new stock, based on advice from Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. Chang also decided to only commit to fulfilling half of Apple's initial demand for the 20-nanometer chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:23">[01:25:23]</a>. Apple's purchasing people were surprised, but Jeff Williams "took it fairly willingly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:44">[01:30:44]</a>.

### Intel's Challenge and Samsung's Lead
In February 2011, Jeff Williams informed Chang that Intel had approached Tim Cook (Apple's CEO) to consider Intel for iPhone chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:08">[01:37:08]</a>. Chang was not overly concerned, as he felt [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] was nearly at par with Intel in technology, superior in manufacturing, and had greater customer trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Indeed, Tim Cook later told Chang that Intel "just does not know how to be a foundry," implying Intel's lack of customer-centricity compared to [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>.

However, the decision to pursue the 20-nanometer node for Apple caused a significant "trade-off": it delayed [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s 16-nanometer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. As a result, Samsung, which skipped the 20-nanometer node, gained a temporary lead in the 16-nanometer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>. Morris Chang was "shocked" to learn that Apple had placed its first 16-nanometer orders with Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>. Jeff Williams reassured Chang that Apple would buy from [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] as soon as their 16-nanometer process was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>. True to his word, when [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s 16-nanometer became ready about half a year later, most of Apple's 16-nanometer requirements shifted to [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>. This highlights the advantage of [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s "Pure Play Foundry" model, as Samsung was a direct competitor to Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:13">[01:55:13]</a>.

## Key Insights from Client Relationships

### The "Pure Play Foundry" Model
A critical factor in [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s success, particularly in attracting and retaining major clients, is its "Pure Play Foundry" business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:06">[02:22:06]</a>. This means [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] does not design its own chips or compete with its customers' end products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>. This fosters deep trust, as clients like Apple and Nvidia know their designs are safe and [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] is solely dedicated to manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>. Intel, conversely, struggled as a foundry because it also designed its own chips, creating a conflict of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:33">[01:45:33]</a>.

### Strategic Investment and the "Sweet Spot"
Morris Chang's decision to commit heavily to the 28-nanometer node, increasing capital expenditures almost threefold in 2010, was a "bet the company" move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>. This decision was based on the R&D team's conviction that 28-nanometer would be a "Sweet Spot" in the progression of Moore's Law, indicating a period of high demand and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. This foresight, combined with a fixed R&D budget of 8% of revenue, regardless of economic conditions, propelled [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s technological leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

### Learning Curve Theory and [[tsmc_pricing_strategy | Pricing Strategy]]
[[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s operations are deeply rooted in the learning curve theory, which posits that unit costs decrease as cumulative production volume increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>. Morris Chang refined this theory for the semiconductor industry during his time at Texas Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a>. The core insight is to price aggressively and even unprofitably in early stages to gain maximum volume, thereby driving down costs faster than competitors and establishing market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. This allows the company with the highest volume to achieve the lowest prices, creating a flywheel effect for reinvestment in the next technology node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

This [[tsmc_pricing_strategy | pricing strategy]] requires precise forecasting of market demand and capital expenditure planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:27">[02:40:27]</a>. [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s ability to balance customer demand with financial prudence, as seen in the Apple deal where they accepted half the order, demonstrates this strategic application of the learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:23">[02:25:23]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s enduring relationships with Nvidia and Apple are testaments to its strategic vision, technological excellence, and commitment to a "Pure Play Foundry" model. These partnerships, often navigating significant challenges and strategic decisions, have been instrumental in [[the_impact_of_technological_advancements_on_tsmcs_growth | TSMC's growth]] into a trillion-dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:31">[02:26:31]</a> and underscore its critical role in [[tsmc_and_its_importance_in_global_supply_chains | global supply chains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:19">[03:18:19]</a>.

Hermès, the esteemed luxury goods manufacturer, stands as a testament to enduring craftsmanship, strategic independence, and a unique approach to business in the luxury sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:32">[01:31:32]</a>. While the company is known for its iconic handbags, it maintains a deliberate distance from conventional [[business_strategies_and_history | manufacturing efficiencies and economies of scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>.

## Founding and Early Years

The story of Hermès begins in Paris, France, in 1837 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. This makes it the oldest company ever covered on the Acquired podcast, predating even Standard Oil or The New York Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>.

### Thierry Hermès (First Generation)

Thierry Hermès, the founder, was born in 1801 in Krefeld, Germany, as the sixth child of innkeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. His father was French, and his mother was German <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Tragically, Thierry was orphaned by age 20, losing his entire family either directly in the Napoleonic Wars or to related disease and famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

In 1821, Thierry left Germany for Normandy, France, where he apprenticed for 16 years under a master craftsman, learning the art of *equipage* craftsmanship – the business of outfitting horse-drawn carriages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. His clientele primarily consisted of the nobility, for whom the horse was akin to a luxury vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

By 1837, Thierry moved to Paris, opening his own shop on Rue Basse-du-Rempart, where he quickly became known as the best harness maker and carriage outfitter, serving the nobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

The rise of Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, significantly impacted Hermès's early success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. Napoleon III modernized Paris by transforming its medieval streets into grand boulevards like the Champs-Élysées, creating public spaces for the nobility to display their wealth and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. This era also saw a shift where social status became more attainable through wealth and achievement, rather than solely by birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

A key client for Thierry, as well as for [[history_and_significance_of_the_rolex_daytona | Louis Vuitton]], was Empress Eugénie, Napoleon III's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. While Louis Vuitton focused on luggage and trunks for the coming age of trains and cars, Hermès remained rooted in the equestrian world, a connection that is still deeply ingrained in its brand identity today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.

## Generational Transition and Modernization

The continuity of craftsmanship and family leadership is a defining characteristic of Hermès <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Charles-Émile Hermès (Second Generation)

Upon Thierry's death in 1878, his son, Charles-Émile, took over, having apprenticed under his father for 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. Charles-Émile expanded the business by adding saddlery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a> and, in 1880, moved the workshop and store to the famous 24 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris, known today as "Le Fg" within the Hermès universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>.

### Adolphe and Émile Hermès (Third Generation)

In 1902, Charles-Émile retired, and his two sons, Adolphe and Émile, took the helm, renaming the company "Hermès Frères" (Hermès Brothers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:18]</a>. Émile, the more ambitious of the two, ventured to Russia in the late 1890s, securing the Tsar of Russia as a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

Émile's pivotal moment came during World War I when he traveled to the United States to study industrial production. He visited Henry Ford's factories in Detroit, witnessing the efficiency of the assembly line and foreseeing the dominance of the automobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>. While embracing some production ideas, Hermès maintained its commitment to non-mechanized, human craftsmanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. In America, Émile also discovered and secured an exclusive two-year license for the zipper in France, initially called the "closeall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>. For years in France, the zipper was known as the "Hermès Fastener" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:30]</a>. He even created the world's first zippered jacket, a leather golf jacket for the British Duke of Windsor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:00">[32:18:00]</a>.

The diverging visions of the brothers led to Émile buying out Adolphe in 1919, solidifying Hermès's transition into the automobile era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:03]</a>. Émile encouraged his craftsmen to create products that would appeal to clients in this new age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:00">[34:25:00]</a>. The existing Haut à Courroies bag, originally designed to carry saddles and boots, became the spiritual predecessor to the iconic Kelly and Birkin bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>.

In 1922, Émile's wife requested a smaller version of the Haut à Courroies bag that would fit through car doors, marking the launch of Hermès's handbag business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>. By 1925, ready-to-wear clothes were added, followed by jewelry in 1927 and watches in 1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:00]</a>. During this period, Hermès collaborated with expert craftsmen in various fields, rather than building all competencies in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:48:00">[37:48:00]</a>. Early stores were opened in travel destinations like Biarritz, catering to their traveling clientele <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>.

### Robert Dumas (Fourth Generation)

Émile had four daughters, and as women were not typically expected to take over the business at the time, leadership transitioned to their husbands, forming the Dumas, Guerrand, and Puech families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:03:00">[43:03:00]</a>. Robert Dumas, one of the sons-in-law, brought a new dimension of "Whimsy and art" to the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:17:00]</a>.

Robert redesigned the handbag line into the *Sack à Dépêches* in 1935 and introduced the iconic *Chaîne d'Ancre* bracelet (chain of anchors) in the 1930s, inspired by boat anchors on a beach in Normandy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>. Hermès initially embraced "quiet luxury," with products not overtly branded but recognized by their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:58:00">[46:58:00]</a>.

In 1937, Robert introduced the classic Hermès silk scarves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:29:00">[48:29:00]</a>. These scarves became a huge success, with 300 silk moth cocoons required per scarf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:54:00">[48:54:00]</a>. Their designs were whimsical, often based on Robert's own wood block engravings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:06:00">[49:06:00]</a>. By 1988, silk accounted for 55% of the company's sales, compared to just 9% for leather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:40:00">[49:40:00]</a>. Queen Elizabeth popularized these scarves globally by wearing them as headscarves in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:41:00">[50:41:00]</a>.

The production of Hermès silk scarves remains highly traditional:
*   Silk is sourced from Hermès-owned farms in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:20:00">[51:20:00]</a>.
*   Only 20 new designs are created annually, with old designs retired and occasionally brought back from a "Disney Vault" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:33:00">[51:33:00]</a>.
*   The pipeline for a new design to reach customers is two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:43:00">[51:43:00]</a>.
*   Each scarf is screen-printed by hand, with each color requiring its own hand-etched mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:55:00">[51:55:00]</a>.
*   The entire process involves a designer, engraver, colorist, weaver, printer, and finisher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:26:00">[53:26:00]</a>.

The Hermès Orange Box, a brand staple, originated during World War II due to a shortage of cream-colored packaging, forcing the company to use available orange boxes originally designed for bakeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:03:00">[56:03:00]</a>. After the war, Robert introduced the iconic Hermès logo, inspired by the 19th-century painting *Duc Attelé, Groom* (hitched carriage, waiting groom), a callback to its carriage-making heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:46:00">[59:46:00]</a>.

Robert also hired theater set designers Annie Beaumel and [[business_strategies_and_history | Leila Menchari]] to create elaborate window displays at the Faubourg Saint-Honoré flagship store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. These displays were more akin to museum exhibits, showcasing art and dreamlike narratives rather than just products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.

In 1956, the *Sack à Dépêches* bag gained immense popularity when Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco was photographed clutching it to conceal her pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. Robert officially renamed it the "Kelly bag" before his retirement in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.

## The Saddle Stitch

A core element of Hermès's craftsmanship is the saddle stitch, a superior hand-stitching technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. It involves punching holes through two pieces of leather with an awl and using two needles on a single thread, passing one through each direction, creating an incredibly strong, interlocking mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. This method ensures that if a stitch breaks, the entire seam will not unravel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a>.

Every Kelly bag is made by a single craftsman, beginning with 36 unique pieces of high-quality leather from the same animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>. The process takes about 20 hours over several weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>. Artisans undergo two years of training just to become a Hermès artisan, with additional years before they are allowed to work on Kelly or Birkin bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>.

This knowledge, referred to as *savoir-faire* (know-how or expertise), is transmitted from one artisan to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Hermès prides itself on the repairability of its products, with 15 dedicated repair shops worldwide mending 120,000 pieces annually, some over a century old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>.

## Jean-Louis Dumas (Fifth Generation)

By the 1970s, Hermès faced challenges as its traditional appeal waned amidst the rise of fashion-driven luxury brands like Dior and Gucci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>. Consultants even recommended outsourcing production and lowering prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. This period spurred Hermès to adopt a corporate policy of not hiring consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>.

Jean-Louis Dumas, Robert's son, took over in 1978, having apprenticed in the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. His experience working at Bloomingdale's in the U.S. provided him with insight into a broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:48">[01:37:48]</a>.

Jean-Louis's strategy was to make Hermès relevant without abandoning its core traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:33">[01:38:33]</a>. In 1979, he launched an advertising campaign featuring young Parisian women wearing Hermès scarves with jeans in playful ways, a subtle nod to a younger, more modern demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>. This approach allowed Hermès to coexist with fashion trends without becoming a fashion brand itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>.

Jean-Louis also recognized the massive growth in the global affluent population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:47">[01:43:47]</a>. In 1984, on a flight from Paris to London, he designed the Birkin bag after a conversation with British-French actress Jane Birkin, who needed a larger, more functional bag for her busy life as a mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>. The Birkin, larger than the Kelly and with two handles, was a more casual, modern tote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:21">[01:50:21]</a>. It was not an immediate success, taking about five years to gain traction, but by 2001, it became a cultural touchstone, even featured in a *Sex and the City* episode for its notorious waiting list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:01">[01:51:01]</a>.

Hermès deliberately sells its most coveted items, like the Birkin and Kelly bags, below their market-clearing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:49">[01:58:49]</a>. This creates scarcity and heightens demand, compelling customers to purchase other Hermès products to build a relationship with the brand in hopes of being offered a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:31">[01:59:31]</a>. These are known as Veblen goods, where demand increases with price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:18">[01:58:18]</a>.

In 1993, Jean-Louis led Hermès to list on the Paris Stock Exchange, with the family selling 19% of the company to the public, retaining 81% control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:17">[02:08:17]</a>. By 2006, when he retired, Jean-Louis had grown annual revenue from under $100 million to $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:12">[02:06:12]</a>.

### The Bernard Arnault Challenge and Axel & Pierre-Alexis Dumas (Sixth Generation)

The early 2000s saw [[luxury_brand_strategies_and_rolex | Bernard Arnault]], CEO of [[lvmh_brand_strategy_and_market_positioning | LVMH]], quietly acquire a stake in Hermès <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:23">[02:12:23]</a>. He used equity swap derivatives to build his stake over 10 years without public disclosure, eventually controlling 22.6% of the company by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:47">[02:12:47]</a>. Arnault believed Hermès had cracks in its business, pointing to issues like a canvas beach bag being sold and then destroyed due to not meeting brand standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:16">[02:20:16]</a>. He also noted their unstrategic investments in other companies like Leica cameras and the Chinese luxury brand Shang Xia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:50">[02:24:50]</a>.

In response, over 50 of the 80 Hermès family members pooled 50.2% of their equity into a new cooperative vehicle called H51, contractually locking up their shares for at least 20 years to prevent a hostile takeover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:10">[02:34:10]</a>. This defense, spearheaded by investment banker Julie Guerrand and Axel Dumas (who had also worked in investment banking), ultimately succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:31">[02:35:31]</a>. Although French courts ruled Arnault's stake acquisition illegal, he still profited massively through share swaps, consolidating his control over Dior and increasing his stake in LVMH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:01">[02:39:01]</a>.

Axel Dumas became CEO in 2013, with his cousin Pierre-Alexis Dumas as artistic director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:24">[02:15:24]</a>. They represent the sixth generation of family leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>. Their key achievement has been to scale handcrafted artisanal production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:38">[02:43:38]</a>. Hermès now employs 7,000 master craftsmen, adding 500 new artisans annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:16">[02:46:16]</a>. They achieve this by building their own training pipeline, opening trade schools in rural French areas with high unemployment, ensuring 100% graduation rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:23">[02:50:23]</a>. Today, 80% of Hermès artisans are women, and the average age is 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>. Hermès has 31 workshops across France, each limited to 250-300 craftsmen to maintain a "workshop" feel rather than a "factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>.

Hermès's business strategy is built on three pillars: creation, craftsmanship, and an exclusive distribution network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:37">[03:43:37]</a>. They spend significantly less on traditional advertising (4.5% of revenue on communication versus LVMH's 12%) and rely heavily on word-of-mouth and high-profile events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:29">[03:30:29]</a>. They also avoid celebrity endorsements, believing their products' desirability attracts celebrities organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:51">[03:33:51]</a>.

In 2015, Hermès partnered with Apple for the [[luxury_brand_strategies_and_rolex | Apple Watch]] Hermès, a surprising move given Hermès's exclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:46">[02:56:46]</a>. While the bands are priced lower than most Hermès leather goods (e.g., $540 for a deployment buckle strap) and are machine-sewn, it represents an attempt to bridge the gap to a broader, tech-savvy audience and introduce new customers to the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:05">[03:01:05]</a>.

Other notable initiatives include:
*   **Petite H**: Launched in 2010, this initiative uses leftover high-quality materials from other Hermès products to create whimsical, smaller items, reflecting a philosophy of "creation in reverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:52">[03:15:52]</a>.
*   **E-commerce strategy**: Hermès's online presence primarily serves as an educational platform for its most exclusive products (like Birkin bags, which are not available for direct purchase online) while offering accessible items to new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>. 70% of online buyers are new to Hermès <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:02">[03:39:02]</a>.
*   **Airport strategy**: Airport stores offer a less intimidating entry point for first-time buyers compared to flagship boutiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:06">[03:40:06]</a>.
*   **Store Merchandising**: Hermès employs a "pull model" for its stores, where local store managers select inventory based on their clientele's preferences, rather than headquarters dictating stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:51">[03:55:51]</a>. This ensures no two stores are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>.

Hermès maintains remarkable employee retention, with only 6% annual turnover and 4.5% voluntary departures, reflecting the unique value proposition of working for the brand, particularly for artisans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the average U.S. industry turnover of 33% and LVMH's 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:30">[03:41:30]</a>.

Today, Hermès boasts a 71% gross margin and 44% operating margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:49">[02:42:49]</a>. Leather goods and saddlery remain the largest segment at 43% of the business, followed by ready-to-wear and accessories at 27% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:13">[03:13:13]</a>. Silk and textiles now account for only 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. The business is increasingly global, with Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) representing 48% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>. In China, 80% of Hermès clients are under 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

Despite its incredible financial success, Hermès's pricing strategy is not solely about maximizing profit. While revenue has grown by 15% compounded annually under Axel's leadership, production only increases by 7% per year, meaning prices contribute significantly to growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:41">[03:18:41]</a>. This deliberate restraint in pricing and supply fosters demand and enhances the brand's long-term desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:52">[01:59:52]</a>. Hermès prioritizes its generational legacy, ensuring the brand remains an investment rather than a fleeting trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:25">[03:20:25]</a>.

Hermès's business model is a "rate-limited flywheel," intentionally slowing cycles to maintain exclusivity and brand integrity, operating in the opposite way of companies like Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:26">[02:54:26]</a>. The company's unique value proposition is a bundle of exclusivity, service, craftsmanship, a superior shopping experience, and a revered brand, a combination that is almost impossible to replicate in the modern luxury market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:20">[03:44:20]</a>.

Brooks Running, under the leadership of CEO Jim Weber, has a rich history of navigating significant ownership changes and acquisitions, transforming from a struggling shoe company into a billion-dollar brand. This journey highlights the [[Balancing Risks and Opportunities in Changing Markets | challenges and opportunities]] inherent in such transitions.

## Initial Crisis and Turnaround Strategy (2001-2006)

When Jim Weber took the helm at Brooks in 2002, the company faced a severe crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. It was losing five million dollars a year, carried thirty million dollars in debt, and was a week away from missing payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The board held weekly meetings just to figure out how to meet payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Brooks, a nearly 90-year-old business with modest revenue of $60 million, sold a random assortment of products at every price point, not exclusively in running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Jim Weber's pivotal decision was to bet the company exclusively on serving active runners as a segment, cutting all other business lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This was a radical move, as the industry was traditionally structured around factories needing to stay busy year-round by producing various sports footwear, often at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Most of these product lines, such as $30 "barbecue shoes" sold to large retailers like Big 5, were low-margin or losing money, tying up inventory and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Eliminating these products, even if it meant walking away from significant revenue (e.g., $10 million from Big 5), was an "easy decision" to free up cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

### Gaining Trust and Delivering Results
As the fourth CEO in a short period, Weber faced the [[Challenges in establishing a new venture capital firm | challenge]] of gaining the team's trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. His approach involved:
*   **Redefining the Plan:** Within six weeks, he revised the company's plan, setting achievable profit targets that had not been met in years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
*   **Focus on Cash Flow:** Prioritizing cash flow, he shrunk the balance sheet, generating $10 million in cash within the first nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
*   **Product Delivery:** He ensured the critical Adrenaline shoe was refined and delivered successfully for 2002, air-freighting one color to save the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Vision:** Weber's personal motto was "constancy of purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>, aiming to build a lasting brand rather than just a quick turnaround. He believed "companies with issues get sold; companies with the opportunity attract investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Navigating Private Equity and Corporate Ownership

Brooks' journey through ownership changes is marked by several transitions:

1.  **JH Whitney Capital:** The private equity firm that owned Brooks before Weber took over was looking to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Despite the dire situation, they recapitalized the company, writing a check to keep it afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Whitney eventually had a "good outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
2.  **Russell Athletic Acquisition (2004):** Brooks was sold to Russell Athletic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. Jim Weber and his team negotiated their independence, convincing Russell to "just leave us alone" given Brooks' unique and successful trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.
3.  **Fruit of the Loom Acquisition (2006):** Two years later, Russell Athletic was acquired by Fruit of the Loom, which was already a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. Brooks, as a subsidiary of a subsidiary, faced the threat of being moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where Fruit of the Loom was consolidating operations. Weber knew this would "kill Brooks" by causing talent loss and forcing Brooks into an incompatible business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. He again negotiated to retain independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. Warren Buffett initially remained uninvolved, allowing Fruit of the Loom to make the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.

### Direct Report to Warren Buffett
In 2011, Brooks' relationship with Berkshire Hathaway changed dramatically. After a period of Brooks selling shoes at the Berkshire annual meeting and positive reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>, Jim Weber had a three-hour meeting with Warren Buffett in Omaha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. Buffett, known for understanding brands and competitive moats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>, couldn't figure out why the "big guys weren't squashing" Brooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.

Six months later, Buffett called Weber, proposing to spin Brooks out from Fruit of the Loom and establish it as a standalone subsidiary, directly reporting to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>. This elevation provided Brooks with a "platform to do what we want to do and build our brand" with confidence and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>. This direct reporting relationship allowed Brooks to maintain its focus on premium, full-margin products and pursue its specific growth strategy without needing outside capital since 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, a fact admired by Buffett due to its high return on tangible net assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

## Current and Future Challenges

Despite its success, Brooks continues to face [[Challenges in the agency business model | challenges]], particularly in supply chain resilience. An A-plus case for Brooks involves 20-30% annual growth, heavily driven by international expansion to reach 60 million customers and $4 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. However, a significant risk lies in "single points of failure" in its operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. For example, a distribution center launch failed in 2019, disappointing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. More recently, 45% of its factories in Vietnam were shut down for three months in Q3 2021 due to COVID-19, impacting growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. Brooks is now focused on building resilience and agility in its supply chain by diversifying risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

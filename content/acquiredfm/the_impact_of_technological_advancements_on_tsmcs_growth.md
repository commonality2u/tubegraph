[[origins_and_history_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s journey to becoming a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing is deeply intertwined with its strategic responses to and anticipation of technological advancements. The company's unique "Pure Play Foundry" model, combined with an aggressive investment strategy in research and development and capital expenditures, allowed it to capitalize on shifts in the technology landscape.

## Early Engagement and Strategic Partnerships

[[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s deep involvement with semiconductors began with an obsession that emerged from a previous [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC episode]] four years prior to this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This early focus laid the groundwork for understanding the industry's intricate workings.

A pivotal moment in [[tsmcs_strategic_partnerships_and_industry_collaborations | TSMC's strategic partnerships]] was the unsolicited letter from Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. At the time, Nvidia was a small, four-year-old company facing bankruptcy with only 50-60 employees, while [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] already exceeded $1 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Despite the significant size difference, [[morris_chang_and_the_founding_of_tsmc | Morris Chang]] personally met with Jensen Huang, who, despite Nvidia's financial difficulties, boldly predicted that their new chip would not only save the company but also make Nvidia a major [[tsmcs_strategic_partnerships_and_industry_collaborations | TSMC customer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This prediction came true; within two to three years, Nvidia became one of [[tsmcs_strategic_partnerships_and_industry_collaborations | TSMC's top five customers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This early partnership highlighted [[tsmcs_business_strategies_and_comparison_with_apple | TSMC's willingness to engage with small, promising companies]], a strategy that would prove crucial in the emerging fabless era.

## Navigating Technological Challenges: The 40 Nanometer Node

By 2009, when [[morris_chang_and_the_founding_of_tsmc | Morris Chang]] retook the CEO position at [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]], the company was facing significant issues with its 40 nanometer (nm) node, including manufacturing and quality problems that impacted major customers like Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Chang prioritized resolving this issue, recognizing its importance as a key node in the progression of [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. He personally negotiated a resolution with Jensen Huang, offering over $100 million in compensation, which was accepted within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. This demonstrated [[tsmcs_business_strategies_and_comparison_with_apple | TSMC's commitment to customer relationships]] and its willingness to address significant technical challenges to maintain its leadership position.

## The 28 Nanometer "Sweet Spot" and Aggressive Investment

Following the resolution of the 40nm issues, [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] made a decisive commitment to the 28nm node, which its R&D team identified as the "Sweet Spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. To capitalize on this, Chang implemented a fixed R&D budget of 8% of revenue, regardless of economic conditions, providing stability and confidence to the R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

Furthermore, in 2010, [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] dramatically increased its capital expenditures threefold, from around $2-2.5 billion annually to almost $6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This aggressive investment, which faced questions from the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>, was a strategic bet on the future, driven by insights from market forecasts and the business development department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. This move coincided with the rise of the smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>, which fueled immense demand for chips produced on this node, solidifying [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC's leadership]] in the industry.

## The Apple Partnership and the 20 Nanometer Detour

[[tsmcs_business_strategies_and_comparison_with_apple | Apple]] approached [[tsmcs_strategic_partnerships_and_industry_collaborations | TSMC]] in late 2010 seeking a partnership for its iPhone chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. The meeting with Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, was a direct request for [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] to produce chips on a 20nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. This was a surprise to [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] as their planned progression was from 28nm directly to 16nm, making 20nm a "half-step" or "detour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>.

Despite the significant financial commitment involved (tens of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>) and the fact that [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s R&D capabilities at the time were not strong enough to develop two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>, [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] decided to accept half of Apple's requested volume by borrowing money rather than cutting dividends or issuing new stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. This decision was based on "prudent financial planning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>.

During this period, Intel also approached [[tsmcs_business_strategies_and_comparison_with_apple | Apple]] for manufacturing, but Tim Cook's response that "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a> underscored [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC's competitive advantage]]: its pure-play model, its commitment to customer service, and its willingness to meet diverse customer demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:53">[01:45:53]</a>.

The detour to 20nm did have a "serious trade-off": it delayed [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC's 16nm development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>, allowing Samsung to briefly pull ahead and secure initial 16nm orders from [[tsmcs_business_strategies_and_comparison_with_apple | Apple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>. However, [[tsmcs_strategic_partnerships_and_industry_collaborations | Apple]] reaffirmed its commitment, promising to buy from [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] once their 16nm process was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>, which ultimately ensured that most of Apple's 16nm requirements went to [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>.

## Foundational Principles and Future Glimpses

[[tsmcs_business_strategies_and_comparison_with_apple | TSMC's growth]] was also underpinned by a fundamental understanding of the **Learning Curve Theory**, which [[morris_chang_and_the_founding_of_tsmc | Morris Chang]] helped refine at Texas Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a>. This theory emphasizes that as production volume increases, unit costs decrease due to gained experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:14">[02:03:14]</a>. The strategic implication is to aggressively pursue volume to achieve the lowest costs and dominate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. This principle guided [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC's aggressive pricing and investment strategies]].

Chang also foresaw the rise of "fabless" companies, those that design chips but do not manufacture them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>. Early experiences with companies like Gordon Campbell's venture and ATM (later Atmel) demonstrated the emerging need for dedicated foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:08">[02:18:08]</a>. This foresight was crucial for [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]], as the fabless model became a dominant force in the semiconductor industry.

The rise of the [[role_of_tsmc_in_the_technology_ecosystem | ARM]] architecture further created a distinct opportunity for a dedicated foundry like [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]. With [[role_of_tsmc_in_the_technology_ecosystem | ARM]] becoming dominant in mobile phones, computers, and now AI chips, it opened the door for [[tsmcs_strategic_partnerships_and_industry_collaborations | TSMC]] to become the leading manufacturer for these chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:09">[02:25:09]</a>. This shift prevented Intel's x86 architecture from maintaining its full dominance and allowed the value chain to disaggregate into specialized companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:02">[02:25:02]</a>.

## The Hsinchu Science Park Ecosystem

A significant factor in [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC's success]] is its physical location within the Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan. This government-sponsored industrial park houses not only [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s headquarters and fabs but also its key partners and customers, including EDA companies like Synopsys and Cadence, [[role_of_tsmc_in_the_technology_ecosystem | ARM]], Qualcomm, and MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:26">[02:28:26]</a>. Two universities within the park consistently produce PhDs who are absorbed into the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>. This close geographic proximity facilitates intense collaboration and communication, making the ecosystem incredibly integrated and difficult to replicate elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:40">[02:30:40]</a>.

## [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | Moore's Law]] and Sustained Growth

Ultimately, [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC's growth]] is a testament to the enduring impact of [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | Moore's Law]]. The continuous demand for more computing power has driven exponential growth in the semiconductor market, from $26 billion in 1987 (when [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] was founded) to $527 billion in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] has ridden this "ridiculous Tailwind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, continuously investing massive amounts in R&D and capital expenditures (e.g., $20 billion for a new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>), knowing that the value generated by the resulting chips will make these investments profitable. This virtuous cycle, combined with its specialized pure-play model and unique ecosystem, has allowed [[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] to become a trillion-dollar company and a critical component of the global technological landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:12">[02:46:12]</a>.

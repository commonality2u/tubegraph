[[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]]'s journey to becoming a trillion-dollar company and a cornerstone of global semiconductor manufacturing is deeply intertwined with its strategic embrace of technological advancements and the inherent principles of the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>. The company's unique "pure-play foundry" model, coupled with a keen understanding of market dynamics and continuous investment in research and development, allowed it to not only grow but also dominate the leading edge of chip fabrication.

## Early Vision and the Rise of "Fabless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a>

Morris Chang, [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC's]] founder, had a clear vision for the company: a dedicated "pure-play foundry" that would not compete with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. This was a critical distinction, especially when compared to integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel, which designed and manufactured their own chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>. Chang recognized that IDMs would eventually need external manufacturing capacity, particularly for their less critical or older-node chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:07">[02:16:07]</a>.

Crucially, Chang anticipated the emergence of the "fabless" business model, where companies would focus solely on chip design and outsource manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a>. He noted early signs, such as a company seeking $5 million in funding to start without building a fab, and another, ATM, wanting General Instrument (where Chang worked previously) to make wafers for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:35">[02:18:35]</a>. This foresight allowed [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]] to strategically position itself as the ideal partner for these new, design-focused companies.

The mid to late 1980s proved to be a "golden period" for the semiconductor industry, seeing the founding of key companies like ARM, Synopsis, Cadence, and ASML, all crucial components of the modern chip ecosystem, alongside [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:30">[02:27:30]</a>. The rise of the ARM architecture was particularly significant, as it opened a new opportunity for a dedicated foundry specializing in ARM chips, a path that might not have existed had x86 dominance persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:02">[02:25:02]</a>.

## The Learning Curve and Strategic Investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>

A core tenet of [[Technological and Business Strategies of TSMC | TSMC's]] success is its deep understanding and application of the "learning curve" theory, which Chang refined during his time at Texas Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a>. The simple explanation is that as a company produces more of a product, its unit cost decreases due to increased experience and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>.

[[Technological and Business Strategies of TSMC | TSMC]]'s strategy, based on this theory, was to become the largest volume player in each new node. This allowed them to spread their substantial fixed costs over the maximum number of units, achieving the lowest possible prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. To achieve this, they would strategically accelerate pricing to where they anticipated it would be at the end of a node's lifecycle, sometimes even operating at an initial loss to gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:31">[02:38:31]</a>. This approach required incredibly precise forecasting of future market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:27">[02:40:27]</a>.

Under Chang's leadership, [[Technological and Business Strategies of TSMC | TSMC]] made bold financial commitments to fuel its technological lead:
*   **R&D Budget**: Chang insisted on setting the R&D budget at 8% of revenue, a fixed percentage that eliminated yearly arguments and ensured continuous investment regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:21">[01:40:21]</a>. This stable funding was instrumental in advancing process technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>.
*   **Capital Expenditures**: In 2010, [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]] tripled its capital spending to nearly $6 billion, a decision that invited significant questions from the board but was crucial for its leadership aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:01">[02:43:01]</a>. Chang justified this by believing in the "sweet spot" potential of the upcoming 28 nanometer node and invoking the Shakespearean idea of taking the "tide in the affairs of man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:05">[02:44:05]</a>.

## Key Technological Nodes and Strategic Bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:01">[02:43:01]</a>

### 40 Nanometer Node Challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>

Around 2009, [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]] faced significant manufacturing and quality problems with its 40 nanometer node, primarily a yield problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. This issue impacted major customers like [[Nvidia | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. Morris Chang's return as CEO in 2009 was partly motivated by the need to resolve these and other company-wide issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a>. He personally intervened to resolve the dispute with [[Nvidia | Nvidia]], offering a settlement of over $100 million, demonstrating the importance of customer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>.

### 28 Nanometer Node Dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:41">[03:32:41]</a>

The strategic investments made around 2010 proved highly successful as the 28 nanometer node coincided with the explosive growth of the smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:10">[02:51:10]</a>. This node solidified [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC's]] leadership among foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.

### The Apple Bet: 20 Nanometer Detour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>

A pivotal moment came when Apple approached [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]] in 2011, not for the 28nm node, but for a "half-step" 20 nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. This was a "detour" from [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC's]] planned progression to 16nm, as their R&D resources at the time were not sufficient to develop two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>.

Despite the distraction and the need for billions in additional capital expenditure (borrowed via corporate bonds after consulting with Goldman Sachs), [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]] decided to accept half of Apple's initial demand for 20nm chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>. This decision highlighted [[Technological and Business Strategies of TSMC | TSMC's]] willingness to adapt its technological roadmap for a strategic customer. [[TSMC pricing strategy | Pricing discussions]] with Apple's COO, Jeff Williams, were part of this negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:11">[02:47:11]</a>.

A temporary setback occurred when Apple placed initial orders for 16nm chips with Samsung, which had been able to skip the 20nm node and thus arrived at 16nm earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:37">[02:51:37]</a>. However, [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]] eventually caught up, developing its own 16nm node about half a year later, and secured most of Apple's 16nm requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:42">[02:54:42]</a>.

## Unwavering Commitment to Technology and Customer Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:21">[01:40:21]</a>

[[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC's]] success is also rooted in its dedication to being a trusted partner, unlike some IDMs that competed with their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. An anecdote involving Apple's consideration of Intel for its iPhone chips in 2011 illustrates this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>. Tim Cook's explanation for sticking with [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]] was simple: "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This meant that while Intel was technologically capable, its culture was not geared towards serving external customers with the same courtesy and responsiveness as [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

This commitment to continuous technological leadership, coupled with a deep understanding of market dynamics and unwavering customer focus, has allowed [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]] to ride the "ridiculous Tailwind" of the semiconductor market, which grew from $26 billion in 1987 to $527 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. As technology advances and the cost of building new fabs escalates, [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC's]] dominant position, built on its unique business model and technological prowess, appears to be an enduring "natural monopoly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:52">[02:41:52]</a>.

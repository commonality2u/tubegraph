The practice of structured, purposeful dinners, as exemplified by Benjamin Franklin, served as a catalyst for the establishment of a unique dinner tradition at [[benchmark_dinner_origins | Benchmark]]. This modern adaptation seeks to foster curiosity, collective effervescence, and open conversation among participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Origin of the Benchmark Dinner Tradition

When Peter joined [[benchmark_dinner_origins | Benchmark]], there was a shared optimism with Bill about injecting new practices and ideas into the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Bill, having recently read a biography of Benjamin Franklin, was inspired by Franklin's own dinner habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Benjamin Franklin's Dinner Practices

Franklin reportedly held four dinners a week, each dedicated to a specific subject, such as finance, chemistry, or life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This focus on deep exploration of topics through dinner conversations provided the impetus for Bill to suggest, "Why aren't we doing dinners?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Adaptation at Benchmark

This inspiration led to an "experiment" with a few dinners, culminating in a significant dinner near the end of 2006 or 2007, which included four outside guests: Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The experience was described as "electric," creating a sense that "time stood still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

The success of these initial dinners led to the realization that a habit of nurturing curiosity, the "essential lifeblood of the firm," was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Unlike typical Monday meetings, dinners offered an "open-ended, no agenda, wild explorations" dynamic range that allowed for deep, sometimes "bizarre," discussions among partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This format honors the firm's purpose of continuous learning and activating curiosity, fostering a "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved in one-on-one settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

The [[importance_of_non_hierarchical_dinner_table_design | non-hierarchical table design]] of the Benchmark dinners, an organic table by Ole Lundberg (inspired by Jean-Marie Masoud), prevents side conversations and ensures everyone is tuned into a single discussion, a core ethos of the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Esteemed guests, often those whom [[benchmark_dinner_origins | Benchmark]] has not invested in, are invited, and the "spotlight of attention" given to them is considered a significant gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

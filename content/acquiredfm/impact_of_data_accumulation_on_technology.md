A core belief is that not all software or AI is created equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This perspective has guided investment strategies over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Data and Databases

In 2000, the leading sector in software was [[evolution_of_databases_since_2000 | databases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. At that time, companies primarily generating revenue from [[evolution_of_databases_since_2000 | databases]] collectively held an enterprise value of about one trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

The volume of data being produced is immense, with more data generated each year than in all preceding years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This ever-increasing data necessitates a storage solution, and projections indicate a continued expansion of sensors to gather even more data in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Vision for Data-Driven Decisions

Bill Gates once addressed a question from Meg Whitman regarding whether all significant technological advancements had already occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His response highlighted the primitive nature of human decision-making at the time:

> "Do you realize how barbaric it is the way we make decisions?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

Gates envisioned a future where vast amounts of stored data would be analyzed by machines to facilitate superior decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He provided examples of how this would apply to various fields:
*   Diagnosing an illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Educating a dyslexic child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Maintaining an aircraft's engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

In this future, decisions would fundamentally be driven by machines analyzing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Transformation of the Database Market

This vision led to a strong conviction that the entire [[evolution_of_databases_since_2000 | database]] market was poised for a complete overhaul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The expectation was that [[evolution_of_databases_since_2000 | databases]] would be remade specifically for the cloud environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Significant focus was placed on developing the cloud infrastructure layer and the necessary tools to enable enterprises to transition to the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This strategic focus proved to be highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

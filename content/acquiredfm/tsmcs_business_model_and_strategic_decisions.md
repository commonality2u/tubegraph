The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) stands as a beacon of innovation and dominance in the global semiconductor industry. Embodying a unique business model, TSMC's strategic maneuvers have elevated it to a pivotal position, supplying essential components for devices worldwide. This article delves into the intricacies of TSMC's business model and the strategic decisions that have shaped its journey.

## Pure Play Foundry Model

TSMC's cornerstone is its pure play foundry business model, a concept that defied industry norms at its inception. As described by [[morris_chang_and_the_foundation_of_tsmc | Morris Chang]], TSMC’s founder, the model focuses solely on semiconductor manufacturing, separate from chip design and sales. This approach capitalizes on Taiwan's potential strength in wafer manufacturing, a sector requiring less initial capital than integrated device manufacturing (IDM).

> At the time of TSMC's founding in 1987, the pure play foundry model was risky, with a primary question looming: "Where's the market?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. Yet, Morris Chang foresaw a burgeoning demand from integrated circuit designers aspiring to launch their own ventures without the capability or capital to build their own Fabs.

## Birth of a New Market

TSMC's decision to focus on the foundry model came at a pivotal time. While IDMs like Intel and Motorola controlled the market, Morris Chang saw potential in servicing emerging [[fabulous_companies_and_their_impact_on_tsmc | fabulous companies]], which lacked manufacturing capabilities of their own. Consequently, TSMC seized the opportunity to serve this nascent market segment, providing manufacturing services to firms like Qualcomm, Broadcom, and eventually tech giants like Apple and [[nvidias_history_and_strategic_decisions | Nvidia]].

## Strategic Partnerships and Investment

Securing strategic partnerships was crucial for TSMC's initial capital and growth. Unable to secure backing from major American semiconductor companies, TSMC turned to Philips, a leading Dutch electronics company, which became a key investor, contributing 28% of the initial capital, alongside Taiwanese government backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Growth through Technological Advancements

A pivotal growth driver for TSMC has been its aggressive investment in cutting-edge manufacturing technologies. By continually advancing [[innovation_and_technology_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | process technologies]] (from 150 nanometers to the Leading Edge 5 and soon 3 nanometer processes), TSMC has ensured its position at the forefront of semiconductor manufacturing, enabling the production of more advanced and efficient chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.

## Playing the Long Game

TSMC’s business strategy embodies long-term vision and execution. Despite early skepticism about the viability of a foundry-only model, TSMC cultivated a robust client base, including nearly all the world’s leading technology innovators. As these clients grew, so did TSMC, which reinvested profits into research and development to maintain an edge in manufacturing capabilities.

## Surpassing Competitors

With over 50% market share and execution of over 90% of the industry’s profits today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>, TSMC has become the world's largest and most profitable chip manufacturer. This supremacy is underpinned by their willingness to bet substantial capital on future trends — including a $9 billion investment in a dedicated plant for Apple’s A-series chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:09">[01:40:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

TSMC's strategic foresight and adaptability have been instrumental in its rise as an industry leader. From founding a new business model in semiconductor manufacturing to making strategic investments and partnerships, [[the_semiconductor_industrys_evolution_and_tsmcs_role | TSMC's journey]] exemplifies transformation and resilience in the face of technological and geopolitical challenges. Its continued focus on innovation ensures its pivotal role in the ongoing [[transformation_of_the_technology_industry | evolution of global technology]].

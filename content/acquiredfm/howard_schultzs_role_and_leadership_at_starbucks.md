Howard Schultz is widely regarded as the effective founder of the Starbucks known today, a global institution with a presence on every corner of the Earth [01:18:24]. He started working at the small chain of three Starbucks stores in 1982, eventually buying the company and becoming its CEO [01:18:21].

## Early Days at Starbucks
Before Schultz joined, Starbucks, founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker, focused solely on selling roasted coffee beans [08:11:08]. The company even initially used Peet's Coffee [06:42:00] beans [06:42:00]. Schultz first encountered Starbucks as a sales representative for a Swedish housewares company, Hammerplast, which sold non-electric coffee makers [07:31:00]. Starbucks was a significant buyer of this product [07:54:00].

His first visit to the Pike Place Market store profoundly impacted him, describing it as being "blown away by the experience" and the "romance of coffee" [08:41:00]. He sought a meeting with CEO Jerry Baldwin, which led to a vendor-customer relationship [08:54:00]. Over about a year, Schultz grew increasingly interested in joining the tiny, three-store company, eventually maneuvering his way into a job as the head of marketing in 1982, just as Starbucks prepared to open its fourth store [09:12:00]. At this point, Starbucks still only sold beans [09:58:00].

The company's ambition at the time was modest, aiming to expand to Portland, Oregon [10:09:00]. Schultz, however, envisioned a much grander future for Starbucks, even while acknowledging his initial career dissatisfaction at Xerox and Hammerplast fueled his drive for more [18:16:00].

## The Italian Epiphany
A pivotal moment in Schultz's vision for Starbucks occurred during a trip to Milan, Italy, in 1983 for a trade show [19:55:00]. He was captivated by the numerous coffee bars, noting the "romance of espresso" and the powerful "sense of community" they fostered [20:45:00]. This experience led to his epiphany: Starbucks needed to be in the beverage business, not just selling beans [21:07:00].

Upon his return, he presented his vision to Jerry Baldwin and Gordon Bowker, but they dismissed it, stating they didn't want to be in the "restaurant business" [21:10:00]. Undeterred, Schultz "banged on the door for two years" until they allowed him to open a small coffee bar section within the sixth Starbucks store in Seattle [21:20:00]. This experimental coffee bar, designed and operated by Schultz himself, quickly saw customer numbers more than double [21:49:00]. Despite its immediate success, the founders remained resistant to the concept [22:05:00].

## Acquiring Starbucks and Il Giornale
Frustrated, Schultz decided to leave Starbucks to start his own coffee bar company, Il Giornale [23:14:00]. The original Starbucks founders, in a surprising move, invested in Il Giornale [23:26:00]. Schultz faced immense challenges raising the initial $1.6 million needed for Il Giornale, speaking to 242 investors, 217 of whom said no [39:34:00]. Two major Italian coffee companies, Faema and Lavazza, also turned him down [24:10:00]. He eventually secured funding from three prominent Seattle citizens: Jack Brous, Herman Sarkowsky, and Sam Strong [25:01:00].

Il Giornale successfully opened three stores: two in Seattle and one in Vancouver, British Columbia [25:24:00]. During this period, Schultz had no salary for nearly two years while his wife, Sherry, was working and pregnant [26:05:00].

The opportunity to acquire Starbucks arose when the original company, having acquired Peet's Coffee, faced significant financial trouble with a debt-to-equity ratio "north of 6 to 1" [30:06:00]. Jerry Baldwin approached Schultz, offering to sell Starbucks for $3.8 million, believing Schultz was the right person to buy it [30:23:00].

A critical moment in this acquisition involved a competing all-cash offer from one of Schultz's own Il Giornale investors, Sam Strong [31:23:00]. Crushed and short on time, Schultz sought advice from attorney Scott Greenberg, who arranged a meeting with his senior partner, Bill Gates Sr. [32:15:00]. Bill Gates Sr. directly confronted Sam Strong, ensuring that Schultz would acquire Starbucks [34:26:00]. The Gates family then helped Schultz raise the necessary funds [35:17:00]. This act of "humility" by Bill Gates Sr. was never publicly revealed by him [36:31:00].

In August 1987, Il Giornale acquired the six Starbucks stores, rebranding Il Giornale as Starbucks Corporation [38:32:00]. By the end of 1987, the company had 11 stores and 100 employees, all in the Northwest [38:43:00]. The original Starbucks founders, now owning Peet's, rebranded their company as Peet's [39:19:00].

## Building the Business Model and Culture
Schultz's early decisions shaped Starbucks' unique business model. He was "religious" about avoiding debt, a philosophy stemming from his childhood experiences with his parents' financial struggles [40:46:00]. Starbucks' model involved sourcing and roasting high-grade arabica coffee beans [41:39:00], which, when sold as beverages, yielded an "80% gross margin" [41:48:00]. Stores were highly profitable, with the investment breaking even within two years, often 1.5 years [43:29:00]. The focus was on "frequency," with loyal customers visiting "18 times a month" [42:48:00].

Schultz emphasized:
*   **Customer Experience**: He designed the first coffee bar himself and worked as a barista [21:37:00]. Starbucks became recognized as the first "experiential brand at scale" [49:25:00].
*   **Quality**: He insisted on using high-quality arabica beans and even changed the cup design from Styrofoam to a paper cup with a compatible "sip lid" to preserve taste and enhance the experience [45:20:00]. He later regretted not trademarking "caf√© latte" or getting an exclusive on the lid [46:47:00].
*   **Language and Customization**: The unique sizing (short, tall, grande, venti) and the practice of writing customer names on cups [47:04:00] (an internal innovation to manage busy stores [48:01:00]) further personalized the experience. Customer customization, often leading to "100,000 different variations of beverages" [02:44:26], significantly increased the average ticket and customer loyalty [02:42:34].
*   **People-First Philosophy**: Deeply influenced by his father's experiences of disrespect and lack of dignity in blue-collar jobs [01:03:51], Schultz sought to build a company that provided respect and dignity [01:03:42]. He wanted to "exceed the expectations of our people so they can exceed the expectations of the customer" [01:03:30]. This led to groundbreaking initiatives:
    *   **Bean Stock (1991)**: Offering stock options to every employee, including part-time workers (20+ hours/week), an unprecedented move in corporate history [01:04:54]. This transformed employees into "partners" [01:05:23] and significantly elevated the brand and reduced attrition [01:05:32]. Initial grants saw an 800x return due to splits [01:07:22].
    *   **Healthcare Benefits (1988)**: Providing comprehensive health insurance to all employees, including part-time workers and gay couples in domestic partnerships, 25 years before the Affordable Care Act [01:05:51]. This was driven by Schultz's childhood experience of his family having no health insurance [01:06:00].
    *   **College Achievement Plan**: Partnering with Arizona State University to offer free four-year college tuition to all partners [02:52:41].

These people-first policies created a culture of humanity, fostering strong relationships between baristas and customers, which Schultz believed was the true "secret of the company" [01:03:18].

## Rapid Expansion and Global Presence
Schultz oversaw an aggressive expansion strategy, doubling store count year over year after acquiring Starbucks [00:54:45]. He chose the first 500 locations himself [01:38:36]. He resisted [[Starbucks Approach to Branding Culture and Innovation | franchising]] to maintain cultural integrity, believing it would dilute the company's unique culture [02:12:50]. Instead, Starbucks focused on company-owned stores and, later, joint ventures for international markets [02:28:02].

Key expansion milestones and strategies included:
*   **Chicago (First Major Market outside Seattle)**: Initially challenging, it was "fixed" by Howard Behar, a key figure in building the company's soul [05:51:00].
*   **Los Angeles**: Schultz pushed hard to enter LA despite internal resistance, envisioning the brand's iconic potential with celebrities and media [05:59:00]. This proved a major success [01:00:29].
*   **Brand Visibility**: Starbucks achieved ubiquity without traditional marketing [01:11:31] by making the cup an "iconic badge of honor" [01:00:40], striking deals with partners like Costco (selling beans [01:09:56]) and United Airlines [01:10:48], and opening cafes within Barnes & Noble stores [01:12:53].
*   **International Expansion**: Initially cautious, Schultz quickly realized the potential for global growth. He wrote off Europe due to existing coffee culture [01:29:33].
    *   **Japan (1996)**: The first international market, chosen partly due to a direct flight to Seattle [01:32:12]. Despite initial resistance from the board and a consultant's negative study [01:30:41], Starbucks entered Japan via a joint venture [01:31:57]. It was an "extraordinary success from minute one" [01:34:48], with its unique concept and branding quickly embraced [01:34:09].
    *   **China (1999)**: Starbucks entered China with a partner that "did not share our values" [01:38:31], leading to struggles for a decade [01:38:51]. Schultz brought in Belinda Wong, who decentralized operations and championed initiatives like health insurance for partners' parents [01:39:50]. China is now a pillar of the company, accounting for 18% of revenue [02:17:34].
    *   **Italy (2018)**: Starbucks finally entered Italy, the birthplace of Schultz's inspiration, much later, with the opening of a Roastery [02:34:03]. This was a "full circle" moment for Schultz [02:38:16].

## Return to CEO (2008) and Turnaround
In 2000, Schultz stepped down as CEO, becoming executive chairman, feeling "physically and emotionally exhausted" [01:41:20]. Orin Smith became CEO, followed by Jim Donald [01:55:00].

However, by 2008, facing the global financial crisis and internal operational issues (including a drop in same-store sales [00:01:48] and a plummeting stock price [00:01:51]), Schultz returned as interim CEO [01:43:00]. The company was in dire straits, "seven months from being insolvent" [01:46:11]. Schultz closed 1,000 underperforming stores and, in an emotional address, apologized to employees, explaining the gravity of the situation and the need to "save the company" [01:45:14].

His turnaround strategy focused on returning to the core "humanity" and "performance-driven through the lens of humanity" [01:47:09]. This included:
*   **Reinvestment in People**: Diverting funds from stock buybacks (which he suspended immediately [03:08:00]) to invest over $2 billion into partners [03:08:10].
*   **Operational Excellence**: Closing all U.S. stores for an afternoon to retrain baristas on coffee purity and the "art of the espresso" [01:50:41].
*   **Rallying the Troops**: Holding a pivotal meeting in New Orleans with 10,000 store managers, emphasizing that each store's success depended on individual efforts to delight customers [01:48:34].

The turnaround was remarkably successful, with profits tripling by 2010 [01:55:36].

During this period, technology became a double-edged sword. The mobile app, launched in 2009 [01:59:10], provided "unbelievable convenience" [02:00:23] and generated significant financial "float" ($1.7 billion in gift card balances [02:49:09]) [02:00:47]. However, Schultz views it as the "biggest Achilles heel" [02:00:08] if not properly managed, as it can "deteriorate...the third place experience" and depersonalize interactions [02:00:53]. He expressed regret that the mobile app wasn't "slow-rolled" and allowed to be "on demand 24 hours a day" without sufficient "technological refinements" to protect the in-store experience [02:06:41].

## Later Years and Leadership Philosophy
Schultz again stepped down as CEO in 2017. He returned as interim CEO for a year from 2022 to 2023 to address challenges arising from the pandemic and ensure a smooth succession, highlighting that his love for the company drove his return [03:07:05].

Schultz's leadership philosophy is deeply rooted in his personal background and values:
*   **Humanity First**: He believes Starbucks' success is "because the underpinning of the company's purpose has been just that" [02:26:43], emphasizing "compassion, empathy, and love" [02:26:24].
*   **Long-Term Vision**: His obsession with quality, integrity, and the partner experience consistently drove decisions, even when they went against short-term financial gains or conventional wisdom (e.g., avoiding franchising, investing in benefits before an IPO) [02:02:55].
*   **Adaptability**: While initially resistant to concepts like Frappuccino, he learned to embrace customer demand and innovation [02:57:15].
*   **Founder's Burden**: Schultz recognizes the unique burden and influence of a founder, acknowledging that his strong leadership may have unintentionally limited the development of new leaders and led to a "reliance on the founder that over time can become unhealthy" [02:58:25]. He notes that companies can lose their "entrepreneurial DNA" and "ability to be on offense" when founders leave [03:00:02].

Starbucks, under his leadership, transformed a "commodity business" into a "premium product, brand and experience" [02:05:15], creating an entire industry and generating employment for millions [02:53:51]. Despite being a large public company, Schultz believes its "success is not an entitlement" and that the company must "keep getting better" [03:04:59].

Today, Starbucks generates $36 billion in revenue and has nearly 450,000 employees globally, with 39,000 stores in 86 countries [02:27:26]. About half of these stores are company-operated, and the other half are managed through joint ventures or licensing agreements rather than traditional franchises [02:28:02].

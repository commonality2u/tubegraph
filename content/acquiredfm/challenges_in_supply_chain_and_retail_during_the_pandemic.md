Brooks Running, led by CEO Jim Weber, demonstrated resilience and achieved significant growth even through the challenges of the pandemic, by leveraging its focused business model and understanding of its customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Initial Impact and Observation
In March 2020, the retail landscape underwent a dramatic change, with stores shutting down across Europe and then North America by the end of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. This immediately froze the cash cycle for many businesses, creating a "white knuckle time" as the lethality and transmissibility of the virus were unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

Despite initial uncertainties, Brooks had a hypothesis that running, being a "recession resistant" activity, would see a surge in participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>. This was based on observations during the Great Recession (2008), where running took off with double-digit growth in regions like Italy and Spain, despite 50% unemployment among young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. Running was perceived as a "healthy alcohol" during economic downturns, being cheap and convenient, requiring minimal equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

### Data-Driven Insights
Brooks confirmed its hypothesis through several methods:
*   **Strava Data:** Daily activity on Strava, a running tracking app, showed consistent growth in participation after quarantine shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.
*   **Field Marketing Observations:** Brooks deployed 45 field marketing personnel to high-traffic running parks in the U.S. every afternoon at 4 PM to count runners, confirming the daily increase in activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.
*   **Digital Sales Tracking:** Brooks had visibility into 85% of its retail sell-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. Digital sales, which previously accounted for 30% of their product flow, surged to 80% by the end of April 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>. By May 2020, Brooks sold more product almost entirely through digital channels than it had in all channels in May 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. This rapid [[shift_in_retail_with_technology_and_ecommerce | shift in retail with technology and ecommerce]] was a key factor in their success.

## Strategic Responses and Advantages
Brooks's focused business model on performance running gear gave it a significant advantage during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. Unlike broad-based retailers with diverse product lines (many of which, like lifestyle products, saw no demand as people stayed home), Brooks knew its product would continue to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. This confidence allowed them to:
*   **Restart Supply Chain Early:** Brooks turned its supply chain back on 6 to 12 weeks before most other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.
*   **Optimize Inventory Management:** In the apparel and footwear industry, inventory management is critical; too much inventory can ruin future product cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. Brooks's focused approach enabled them to manage inventory well during the disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.
*   **Leverage Multi-Channel Approach:** Brooks's ability to move inventory efficiently across multiple channels (online, retail partners) was a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.

As a result of these strategies and the nature of running as a "Covid-friendly" outdoor activity, Brooks grew by 27% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a> and 31% in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>, reaching $1.13 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. They would have seen even higher growth (up to 40%) if not for ongoing supply chain issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.

## Ongoing Supply Chain Challenges
Despite their pandemic success, Brooks continues to face [[product_development_during_economic_challenges | supply chain challenges]]. A distribution center launched in 2019 experienced issues, leading to customer dissatisfaction for three to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. More recently, in Q3 2021 (July-September), 45% of Brooks's factories in Vietnam were shut down for three months, impacting production and limiting growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. This highlights the ongoing need for supply chain resilience and diversification of risk, especially as companies grow and face operational complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

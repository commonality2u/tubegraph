Brooks Running, a Seattle-based shoe brand, has a remarkable story of transformation and growth, culminating in its acquisition by [[non_technology_topics_such_as_berkshire_hathaway_and_the_nfl | Berkshire Hathaway]]. When CEO Jim Weber took the helm in 2002 (April 2001, actually), the company was in a precarious financial state, losing five million dollars a year and saddled with $30 million in debt, just a week away from missing payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. It was a $60 million revenue business at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## From Diversification to Focus: The Early Turnaround

Before Weber's arrival, Brooks had been around for about 90 years, selling a wide variety of products across all price points and categories, not just running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The mindset in the athletic footwear industry originated from owning factories, where companies produced everything from baseball and wrestling shoes to bowling and running shoes to keep operations busy year-round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Much of this production was unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

Jim Weber "bet the company exclusively on serving active runners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. He made the radical decision to cut all other business lines, focusing solely on [[brooks_focus_on_performance_running_shoes | performance running shoes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This strategic shift, which many in the industry thought was "crazy," involved walking away from significant revenue streams, such as the $10 million annual business with Big 5 Sporting Goods for low-margin shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. By removing inventory from these unprofitable segments, Brooks generated $5 million in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

Under Weber's leadership, the company focused on building its brand "at the runner level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. A key insight was that the real business lay in trainers, not just racing shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. The company prioritized profitability and cash flow. Within the first nine months, they hit their profit plan, allowing employees to receive bonuses for the first time in four years, and generated $10 million in cash by shrinking the balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. A crucial early product was the Adrenaline 4, which became an "incredibly balanced shoe" and "saved the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Path to Berkshire Hathaway

### Russell Athletic Acquisition
After stabilizing the business and achieving profitability, Brooks was sold to Russell Athletic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. Jim Weber negotiated independence for Brooks, convincing Russell to "leave us alone" because of the strong flywheel effect and growth trajectory they had established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.

### Fruit of the Loom and Berkshire Hathaway
Two years later, Russell Athletic was acquired by Fruit of the Loom, which was already owned by [[non_technology_topics_such_as_berkshire_hathaway_and_the_nfl | Berkshire Hathaway]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. Brooks found itself a subsidiary of a subsidiary. Weber, who had studied [[non_technology_topics_as_berkshire_hathaway_and_the_nfl | Warren Buffett's]] philosophy, understood that [[non_technology_topics_as_berkshire_hathaway_and_the_nfl | Buffett]] appreciated strong brands with moats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. Despite initial plans to move Brooks to Bowling Green (Fruit of the Loom's base), which Weber believed would "kill Brooks" by causing talent loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, he managed to negotiate continued independence.

### Direct Report to Warren Buffett
The pivotal moment came in 2011, when Jim Weber received a voicemail from [[non_technology_topics_as_berkshire_hathaway_and_the_nfl | Warren Buffett]] (which he found five days later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. This call was prompted by a Wall Street Journal article mentioning Mark Zuckerberg trading his Adidas slides for Brooks Adrenaline shoes, which [[non_technology_topics_as_berkshire_hathaway_and_the_nfl | Buffett]] had seen and circled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

[[non_technology_topics_as_berkshire_hathaway_and_the_nfl | Buffett]] proposed spinning Brooks out from Fruit of the Loom and setting it up as a standalone subsidiary directly reporting to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. This decision, according to Weber, was based on Brooks's focus on shoes and its premium brand position, while Fruit of the Loom focused on apparel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. This elevation provided Brooks with the confidence and support to build its brand, focusing on revenue growth and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## Growth and Moat under Berkshire Hathaway
Since 2001, Brooks has not needed a dollar of outside capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, boasting a return on tangible net assets of over 50% for 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. This financial efficiency is a key reason [[non_technology_topics_as_berkshire_hathaway_and_the_nfl | Warren Buffett]] "likes it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

The company's focus on active runners, who average 2.6 pairs of shoes a year, creates a "stickiness" and customer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Brooks consistently ranks as the number one or two shoe brand at major marathons, a true test of their "frequent runner" customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

Brooks's brand positioning is "approachable" and "inclusive," celebrating every runner regardless of their pace or experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. This contrasts with competitors focused on "victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

The company's "moat" is described as:
*   **Business Model Execution at Scale**: Strong retail partnerships with top running gear retailers, where Brooks is often the number one brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.
*   **Digital Marketing**: Highly focused spending on reaching runners in "active evaluation mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.
*   **Product Excellence**: Consistent delivery of "great product" that excels in "runability, fit, feel, and ride," built on significant R&D investment focused on runner biomechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

Brooks has grown significantly, tripling its business from 2009 to 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The company thrived during the pandemic, growing 27% in 2020 and 31% in 2021, cracking a billion dollars in revenue at $1.13 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. This success was partly due to recognizing that running was a "COVID-friendly" activity and having a multi-channel approach to move inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.

Brooks aims for a "north star 10-year vision" to become a global brand with 60 million customers and $4 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. The company is committed to continued growth, even if it's 15% annually, as they are "not rushing for the exit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. The biggest risks are operational, such as supply chain disruptions like the 2019 distribution center issues or factory shutdowns in Vietnam during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

## Early Rivals: Barnes & Noble

Initially, Amazon's primary competitor was the established bookstore chain, Barnes & Noble. As Amazon prepared to go public, Barnes & Noble began to take notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>.

In early 1997, Barnes & Noble executives flew to Seattle to meet with Jeff Bezos and Tom Alberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>. The Barnes & Noble leadership, including the Regio brothers, reportedly offered to acquire Amazon or threatened to "crush" them, viewing Amazon as a small company in Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>.

Following this meeting, Barnes & Noble launched an initiative code-named "Book Predator" to compete with Amazon, aiming to "kill" them with their own barnesandnoble.com website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:09">[01:57:09]</a>. They also sued Amazon for claiming to be "Earth's largest bookstore" just three days before Amazon's IPO priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:29">[01:57:29]</a>. This contributed to a memo from Forrester Research titling Amazon as "amazon.toast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:46">[01:56:46]</a>.

Ultimately, Barnes & Noble struggled to compete effectively online because they were reluctant to lose money on what they considered a small part of their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:49">[02:03:49]</a>. Their existing distribution operations were optimized for servicing physical stores with large shipments, making the shift to mailing small orders to individual customers difficult and error-prone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>. Amazon, in contrast, was built from the ground up for this specific, complex, combinatorial problem of fulfilling unique orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:24">[01:29:24]</a>.

## The Rise of eBay

[[ebays_early_growth_and_monetization_strategy | eBay]], founded as AuctionWeb by [[pierre_omidyars_background_and_ebay_founding | Pierre Omidyar]] in 1995, became a significant competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:20">[02:12:20]</a>. It officially became eBay in 1997, after Amazon had already gone public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:31">[02:11:31]</a>. Benchmark's [[benchmarks_investment_in_ebay | investment]] of $6.7 million in eBay in the fall of 1997 would become one of the greatest venture investments of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:38">[02:11:38]</a>. eBay went public in September 1998 with a $2 billion market capitalization, and by 1999, its market cap had soared to $25 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

### Clash of Business Models
eBay's business model was asset-light and high-margin, focusing on auctions without the need for extensive physical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:02">[02:10:02]</a>. In contrast, Amazon was building an asset-heavy business with significant capital expenditure on fulfillment centers and logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>.

In the summer of 1998, eBay CEO Meg Whitman and founder Pierre Omidyar visited Amazon's Seattle fulfillment center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:04">[02:13:04]</a>. Jeff Bezos reportedly floated an acquisition offer of around $600 million for eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:13:51]</a>. Whitman's reaction was reportedly, "Pierre, warehouses are not cool. We never want to operate warehouses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:22">[02:14:22]</a>. This highlights a fundamental difference in strategy: eBay valued high-margin internet businesses, while Bezos prioritized customer delight through reliable and fast shipping, which necessitated investing in physical fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:56">[02:14:56]</a>.

### Amazon's Response to eBay
Amazon initially attempted to directly compete with eBay by launching "Amazon Auctions" in March 1999, a secret project intended to clone eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:11">[02:18:11]</a>. While technically superior to eBay's site, it failed to gain traction due to eBay's established network effect of buyers and sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:14">[02:20:14]</a>.

To prevent eBay from gaining a payments advantage, Amazon swooped in and acquired Except.com, a payments startup eBay was considering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:25">[02:19:25]</a>.

After the failure of Amazon Auctions and a proposal from eBay to take over Amazon's third-party selling (Z-Shops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:06">[02:43:06]</a>, Jeff Bezos called an emergency meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:56">[02:43:56]</a>. This led to a radical shift: Amazon decided to integrate third-party sellers directly onto its product pages, launching "Marketplace" in November 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:21">[02:46:21]</a>. This meant Amazon was willing to put its competitors' cheaper listings right next to its own products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:09">[02:47:09]</a>.

Marketplace proved hugely successful, accounting for 15% of all customer orders in Q4 2001 despite launching mid-quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:08">[02:48:08]</a>. Today, Marketplace accounts for over 50% of everything sold on amazon.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:15">[02:51:15]</a>. This strategic pivot, driven by Bezos's "customer obsession," directly leveraged Amazon's traffic and authoritative product catalog (via ASINs), which eBay lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>.

### Long-Term Outcomes
Amazon eventually surpassed eBay in market capitalization in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:53">[02:51:53]</a>. As of the time of recording, eBay's market cap was $27 billion, while Amazon's was $1.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:03">[02:52:03]</a>.

The rise of search engines like Google also impacted eBay, as Google became the best way to search eBay's marketplace, leading to a "Google tax" on eBay's traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:25">[02:57:25]</a>. Amazon, recognizing this threat, invested heavily in its own search capabilities through a subsidiary called A9, which focused on internal product search and eventually led to its lucrative advertising business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:35">[02:58:35]</a>.

Technology is increasingly viewed as a crucial component for modernizing essential sectors like education and infrastructure, areas that have historically been overlooked by venture capital investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Andreessen Horowitz's "American Dynamism" thesis focuses on companies that support the national interest, which includes widespread categories such as education, housing, transportation, and general infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Education

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant deficiencies in the existing 19th-century model of education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. When the world shut down, there were few effective solutions for educating children, from K-12 to higher education, for the majority of Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This realization has sparked a considerable appetite among founders to innovate and create a 21st-century educational model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

The shift extends to career paths, where technology can address the issue of upskilling workers. Companies are emerging that enable a new generation of machinists, for example, to work hand-in-hand with aerospace engineers on complex problems, a collaborative model reminiscent of Silicon Valley in the mid-20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. This offers an alternative to traditional paths that may have become less viable, especially for those who were told working with their hands was "embarrassing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

## Infrastructure and Government

Traditionally, venture capital has avoided government and "physical spaces" due to their entrenched interests, heavy regulation, and the perception that they are not "pure software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. However, it's recognized that Silicon Valley's origins were deeply tied to defense investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Despite this, there has been a multi-decade "do not engage" wisdom from venture capital firms regarding government, viewing procurement as almost impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

The argument for why these sectors are hard to invest in includes:
*   They have existed for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   They often have significant regulatory capture and entrenched players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   They require more capital upfront and may have longer periods before returns are seen, known as going "deeper down the j-curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   They may involve technical risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.

However, the perspective is changing. Technology is increasingly permeating all aspects of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, and it is recognized that government and large civic sectors need the help of technologists to transform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This shift is partly due to the fact that the best software builders are not going into government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, creating a stark contrast between people's technologically advanced private lives and the outdated systems in government workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

Costs in sectors like healthcare, housing, and education have risen because technology has not impacted them sufficiently, often due to regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The belief that "software is eating the world" suggests that these sectors, which are the "last holdout," must eventually be touched by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

### Examples

*   **Flock Safety:** An Atlanta-based company that uses small camera license plate readers to help solve crimes, particularly those involving vehicles, and aid in cases like Amber Alerts and child kidnappings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. Their cameras focus on tracking cars, not people, and have been instrumental in solving dangerous crimes, leading to inbound requests from police departments across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.
*   **Hadrian:** An early investment from the American Dynamism practice, this Los Angeles-based company builds automated machine shops for aerospace and defense manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. This addresses a critical need, as many existing machine shops are owned by retiring baby boomers, and integrating software into these older systems is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. Hadrian focuses on building new, automated shops and upskilling American workers to be technically competent machinists, addressing a "nightmare" scenario where critical parts for hardware companies would face delivery delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   **Anduril:** A company that was initially contrarian and unpopular in San Francisco due to its focus on defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>. However, global events like the war in Ukraine have made it clear that strong defense, built with modern technology, is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. This company, which has multiple offices and works with countries like Australia and the UK, is now seen as essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

## Decentralization and the Future

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend of decentralization, enabling people to work from anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>. This means founders are no longer forced to move to traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley or New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>. This ability to build companies from hometowns, in places like Atlanta, Miami, Austin, or Salt Lake City, is seen as democratizing technology across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. The shift has prompted a "rebirth" of building relationships online and the understanding that the internet is integral to daily life and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>.

This era of "small tech" companies, leveraging tools and capital to build new businesses, represents a "small business revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. The expectation is that the American Dynamism thesis will become a standard investment category in venture capital, similar to enterprise software (SaaS), driving innovation for decades to come by tackling vast sectors of the American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This approach is not seen as "impact investing" or ESG, but as a source of significant American innovation and a profitable area for top venture firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

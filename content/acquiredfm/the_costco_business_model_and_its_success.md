Costco is highlighted as an example of a "wonderful internet business" that exemplifies Charlie Munger's investment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Its success is attributed to a combination of a unique business model, strong culture, and consistent execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>.

## Origins and Investment
Charlie Munger first encountered Price Club, a predecessor to Costco, through Rod Hills, who introduced him to Sol Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Munger bought stock in Price Club on the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. He later joined Costco's board of directors at the suggestion of Warren Buffett, who preferred shorter plane rides to board meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway never attempted to acquire Costco because Warren Buffett "doesn't like retailing," fearing its difficulty and the high rate of failure among retail giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Core Elements of the Business Model
Costco's model is characterized by several key strengths:
*   **Lower Prices** Costco consistently sells cheaper than any other retailer in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Efficient Stores** Operations are conducted in large, efficient stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Abundant Parking** Stores feature ample parking spaces, often 10 feet wide instead of the usual 8 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Targeted Membership** Costco maintains high volumes by "keeping out of their stores all these people didn't do big volumes," effectively targeting customers who purchase in bulk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Membership Rewards** They provide special benefits, such as reward points, to members who frequent the stores, exemplified by the executive membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Capital-Light Operations** The business model is remarkably capital-light, with little investment in inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Suppliers are paid only after their products are sold, meaning Costco operates with 900 warehouses globally full of high-quality merchandise, none of which sits on their books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This means Costco has an automatically leveraged business model because it opens new stores with no capital and owes a whole bunch of money for goods that turnover so rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   **Low SKU Count** Costco effectively utilizes a low SKU (stock keeping unit) count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## Strategic Choices and Culture
*   **Location Strategy** Costco specialized in good locations in "rich suburbs" where wealthy people live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. Sol Price, even in the Price Club days, "always wanted the rich man trying to save money," deliberately targeting a wealthier, smart, and picky clientele <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.
*   **Pricing Discipline** A central norm at Costco is "don't raise the price," aiming to keep it low and consistent forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. This philosophy is famously embodied by the consistently low price of their hot dogs, which they recognize as a significant draw for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>.
*   **Controlled Growth** Costco only grows by about 10% per year because it's "hard to open too many stores a year" due to the complexities of new management, politics, and the need for learning and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. They prioritize comfortable growth over rapid expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.
*   **Brand Power** Costco's private label, Kirkland Signature, is a brand comparable to Tide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.

### Comparison to Competitors
*   **[[Walmarts operational strategies and innovations | Walmart]]'s Failure to Compete** Despite seeing Costco, [[Walmarts operational strategies and innovations | Walmart]] struggled to replicate its success because they were too "wedded by the ideas they already had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. [[Walmarts operational strategies and innovations | Walmart]] was accustomed to acquiring cheap real estate in small towns, which clashed with Costco's strategy of targeting high-cost suburban locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.
*   **Home Depot** Bernie Marcus famously copied Costco's model to create Home Depot, visiting Sol Price and openly adopting many of his strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. This success demonstrates the transferability of Costco's core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   **Floor & Decor** This company is a current imitator of the Costco model, applying it to vinyl wood imitating vinyl flooring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. However, Munger cautions that adding "miscellaneous stuff" to such a focused model can eventually "kill" the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

## International Expansion
Costco had a license to operate in China for 20 years before opening its first store there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. An initial attempt to open a store was derailed when an individual demanded a $30,000 bribe, which Jim Sinegal refused to pay, leading to a 30-year delay in their entry into the Chinese market until the board agitated for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.

## Overall Success
Costco's enduring success is attributed to its "magic of the business model and culture," combined with "very reliable, hardworking, determined execution for 40 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>. Munger considers it one of the rare "bonanzas" â€“ a business so clearly superior that one should "bet heavily" on it when recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

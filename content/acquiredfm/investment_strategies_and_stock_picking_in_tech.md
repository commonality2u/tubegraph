The "Acquired" podcast hosted an "Idea Dinner" live event, featuring various technology investment thought leaders who shared their top stock picks and discussed broader `[[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investment strategies]]` [00:06:01]. The event also included discussions on venture capital and the role of accelerators in the tech ecosystem.

## The Idea Dinner: Rules and Participants
The core segment of the night was a stock-picking contest where participants presented their best `[[Key Investments in Tech Industry | investment ideas]]` starting from May 4th [00:09:10]. The goal was to identify a profitable investment over a chosen timeframe [00:09:18]. Shu Nyatta, a former SoftBank Latin America managing director, served as the judge [00:07:07]. The event was a recreation of a similar stock-picking exercise from February 2021 [00:05:42].

### Investment Picks
Participants were encouraged to pick public stocks, avoiding shilling their private market portfolio companies [00:14:54].

#### Mario Gabrieli: Snowflake
Mario Gabrieli, founder of The Generalist, a publication covering tech, crypto, and `[[venture_capital_strategies and the importance of optimism | venture capital]]` [00:08:34], chose Snowflake as his pick [00:09:52].
*   **Company Overview**: Snowflake is a managed data warehouse that initially gained prominence by separating storage and compute, making it easy to query large datasets quickly [00:10:04].
*   **Market Performance**: It was a "pandemic darling" with a significant IPO pop, trading as high as $403 per share before dropping to around $183-$185 at the time of the event [00:10:30].
*   **Bull Case**: Despite multiple compression, Snowflake shows strong fundamentals: 105% revenue growth, 178% net retention (a potential record for a public company), and over $80 million in free cash flow [00:10:02]. Mario highlighted its potential to compound for many years, summarizing the growth of data in the technology industry [00:11:58]. The company is led by Frank Slootman, described as a "quintessential sustainable growth CEO" who thrives in difficult circumstances, compared to General Patton [00:12:16].
*   **Competitive Landscape**: While acknowledging sector tailwinds, the question was raised about Snowflake's competitive capture of value [00:13:20]. Mario believes their net retention demonstrates their ability to grow with their customer base, faster than other cloud companies of their relative size [00:13:37].

#### Packy McCormick: OpenDoor (and other considerations)
Packy McCormick, known for "Not Boring," initially mentioned considering Composer (a company in his portfolio for automated trading strategies) for a safe pick [00:15:02]. He also discussed Elon Musk's Twitter take-private deal as a non-pick [00:15:45].
*   **Twitter Thesis (Non-Pick)**: Twitter has a "small but loyal and valuable user base" that is currently monetized poorly [00:17:08]. He suggested monetization opportunities like charging for verification to address the bot problem, potentially generating $3 billion in annual recurring revenue from US users alone [00:17:20]. He also anticipated significant cost reductions by firing headcount [00:17:33].
*   **OpenDoor (The Pick)**: Packy ultimately picked OpenDoor, despite it being his "biggest loser" historically [00:20:13].
    *   **Market Position**: OpenDoor "vanquished" Zillow's iBuying program and now dominates the iBuying market [00:18:35].
    *   **Financials**: The company generated $8 billion in revenue last year, trading at a $5 billion market cap [00:19:05].
    *   **Opportunity**: Packy views it as a "venture bet" in the multi-trillion dollar housing market, which offers a "worst UI/UX customer experience" but has a "best solution with iBuying" [00:19:12]. OpenDoor is operationally sound and turned an adjusted EBITDA profit last year [00:19:47]. With Zillow's exit from iBuying, the market is "there to lose" [00:20:00]. He highlighted their "bips for breakfast" company value, focusing on extracting every basis point of efficiency [00:21:03].

#### Ben Gilbert: Coinbase
Ben Gilbert, co-founder and managing director of Pioneer Square Labs and PSL Ventures [00:09:09], chose Coinbase [00:23:22].
*   **Previous Considerations**: Ben considered Google (a past strong pick) and Amazon (due to its retail business being valued at zero, effectively making it a free option alongside AWS) [00:21:48]. He also noted the Twitter arbitrage opportunity if Elon Musk's deal closed [00:22:34].
*   **Coinbase Bull Case**: Ben described Coinbase as a `[[investing_strategies_and_approaches | value investment]]` in crypto [00:23:31].
    *   **Financials**: In the last 12 months, Coinbase generated $10 billion in free cash flow with a market cap of $34 billion, representing a very low price-to-free cash flow ratio [00:23:40].
    *   **Market Position**: It possesses strong network effects, a leading brand in the space, and is growing rapidly in the "first inning of all of crypto" [00:24:17].
    *   **Strategic Advantages**: Coinbase and FTX (another crypto exchange) profit regardless of whether crypto prices go up or down, as long as there is movement [00:25:42]. Ben also highlighted "free options" stapled to the business, such as their NFT business and other ventures [00:25:11]. He sees it as a way to play crypto and Web3 by investing in companies that centralize activity and apply Web2 business models to Web3 [00:25:21].#### David Rosenthal: Amazon
David Rosenthal, an angel investor [00:05:21], selected Amazon as his pick [00:28:57].
*   **Market Performance**: Amazon was trading at about a $1.25 trillion market cap after its stock was "hammered" post-earnings [00:29:14].
*   **Financials**: Amazon achieved $470 billion in revenue in the last 12 months, the second highest globally after Walmart, which it is expected to surpass [00:29:30]. This translates to a 2.5x revenue multiple [00:29:48].
*   **AWS Bull Case**: AWS, with $75 billion in revenue, is a "very high margin business" [00:30:08]. Despite Azure and Google Cloud growing faster, AWS is growing at 37% annually on a much larger base and is bigger than both competitors combined [00:30:51]. David emphasized that AWS is the "picks and shovels of the internet" [00:31:20].
*   **Retail Bull Case**: The narrative that Amazon's retail business is worth zero (as suggested by some analyses) misses the point [00:32:28]. Amazon's retail segment generated $400 billion in revenue and holds a 56% market share of U.S. e-commerce [00:32:03]. The company consistently invests far ahead of the curve, leading to short-term losses but building a deep "moat" that would ensure profitability if investments ceased [00:33:37]. The retail segment also includes high-margin businesses like Amazon sponsored listings, which generated $30 billion in revenue [00:33:16].
*   **Strategic Vision**: David, drawing on a Jeff Bezos framework, focused on what "is not going to change": continued internet growth (favoring AWS) and increased online purchasing (favoring Amazon retail) [00:34:07]. He compared current CEO Andy Jassy to Apple's Tim Cook, implying stable leadership post-Bezos [00:34:57].

### Judge's Commentary and Audience Vote
Shu Nyatta provided commentary on the picks, highlighting that the presenters, as narrative creators, are "very good stock pickers" because they "understand the power of stories and narratives" [00:35:25]. He observed that all presenters thought like `[[venture_capital_strategies and the importance of optimism | venture investors]]`, neglecting to discuss downside risks [00:35:50] and focusing on companies that were "cheap" due to the current market cycle [00:36:29].

The picks were then put to an audience vote by applause:
*   OpenDoor: Received a "five out of ten" clap [00:38:02].
*   Amazon: Received a "solid eight out of ten" clap, adjusted down to a seven due to being in the Amazon arena [00:38:14].
*   Coinbase: Received a "pretty hot" clap, better than Amazon, rated an eight [00:38:36].
*   Snowflake: Received "surprising" applause [00:38:50].

A runoff vote was held between Snowflake and Coinbase, with Coinbase declared the winner by audience applause [00:39:04]. Shu Nyatta revealed his personal pick was Snowflake, "only because of General Patton" [00:39:37]. The actual performance of the picks will be tracked over a five-year hold period [00:40:18].

## Y Combinator Continuity Fund
Anu Hariharan, Managing Partner of Y Combinator's (YC) Continuity Fund, discussed the fund's strategy and YC's evolution [00:47:17].

### What is YC Continuity?
YC Continuity is a multi-stage fund primarily focused on `[[venture_capital_strategies and the importance of optimism | growth stage]]` investments (Series B and above) [00:50:51]. Its goal is to be a "lifelong partner" to YC's "enduring companies," often doubling down on YC alumni [00:51:04]. The fund also provides extensive post-batch programming, including:
*   **Series A Program**: Helps founders prepare pitch decks, negotiate term sheets, and identify investors, typically 6-9 months before raising their Series A [00:51:27].
*   **Post-A and Growth Programs**: Re-batches companies for peer learning and brings in "scale founders" and executives (e.g., Brian Chesky, Tony Xu) to teach about forming recruiting teams, hiring engineers, performance management, and culture [01:06:51].
*   **Pre-IPO Program**: A newer initiative to prepare companies for IPO [01:22:05].

### YC's Evolution and Culture
*   **Origin**: YC Continuity was launched in July 2015 [00:55:51]. The idea stemmed from YC alumni needing continued support and capital beyond the accelerator, especially as the median time to IPO stretched to 11 years in 2015, making late-stage private rounds crucial [00:56:31].
*   **Internal Structure**: YC operates as "one team" [00:53:10]. For accelerator admissions, only one "group partner" needs to say "yes" to accept a company [01:00:40]. For Continuity investments, it's a three-person `[[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | investment committee]]` [01:01:17].
*   **Investment Velocity**: YC Continuity has made only 35 investments in seven years out of 3,500 YC companies, demonstrating a highly selective approach (less than 1%) [01:01:44]. They were initially undercapitalized relative to the success of YC companies [01:02:12].
*   **Funding Model**: YC itself was initially self-funded by its founders [01:09:15]. Over time, external LPs (primarily university endowments) were brought in for both early-stage and late-stage funds [01:09:09]. YC's ambition is to grow batch sizes (potentially to 1,000-2,000 companies) by continuously learning how to scale, while maintaining a high bar for founders working on unique insights [01:11:15].
*   **Founders as "Parents"**: Anu highlighted that YC founders view YC "never as an investor," but "as the parent" [00:58:05]. This deep relationship means founders will reach out to their YC partner for urgent issues even years after graduation [00:58:20]. YC's mission prioritizes "helping more founders start companies and more founders build enduring companies" over fund returns, believing that "if we do right by them, we know that we can have incredible returns" [00:59:01].
*   **Global Reach**: YC is remote-first since the pandemic, with 50% of its batches being international [00:48:48]. They have investments globally, including in India, London, Latin America, and the Middle East, reflecting their mission to enable entrepreneurship worldwide [01:02:49].
*   **Total Market Cap**: The combined market cap of all YC companies is over $600 billion [01:02:37].

### YC's Power: Founder Focus
Anu described YC's power as its ability to assess "what makes a founder a really good founder" [01:14:07], honed through extensive data and pattern recognition [01:14:11]. This `[[investment_strategy_and_personal_strengths | founder-first approach]]` is crucial even at the `[[venture_capital_strategies and the importance of optimism | growth stage]]`, where they have years of interaction with founders [01:14:55]. They evaluate founders based on three key qualities:
1.  **Speed of Movement**: How fast founders "ship" and "iterate" is the "single biggest indicator" of success, demonstrating rapid learning and adaptation [01:16:03].
2.  **Hiring Ability**: How well founders hire engineers and executives, as sloppy hiring can significantly impact growth [01:16:30].
3.  **Clarity of Thought**: The ability to articulate what makes their company a multi-billion dollar business [01:16:47].

Anu emphasized that if these "three qualities hold, the metrics will serve" [01:15:21]. This approach prioritizes "inputs rather than the outputs" or "leading indicators rather than trailing indicators," believing that focusing on these inputs allows them to influence company building through best practices shared by successful alumni [01:17:51].

### Future Outlook for YC
*   **F-Grade Scenario**: YC's greatest fear is "messing up the YC community," which is its core strength and network effect [01:19:30]. A mistake with the community could lead to a rapid deceleration [01:20:11].
*   **A-Plus Scenario**: YC aims to be the "partner for the life of the companies" [01:21:11]. This means continued expansion of programming to support founders beyond IPO, recognizing that challenges persist for CEOs at all stages [01:21:42]. The ambition is to `[[strategic_vision_and_business_pivots_in_the_tech_industry | scale YC globally]]` and support more companies, recognizing that "talent is everywhere" [01:22:34].

## Vanta: Automated Security and Compliance
Vanta, a presenting sponsor, offers an automated security and compliance platform [01:37:37]. Matt Spitz, Vanta's Head of Engineering, explained its purpose.
*   **Functionality**: Vanta provides continuous security monitoring, enabling companies to improve their security posture and prove it via compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR [01:42:27].
*   **Problem Solved**: Traditionally, compliance involves months of manual document exchange and sampling of data, which is "lossy" and provides only a point-in-time assessment [01:42:41]. Vanta automates this by collecting and presenting data in a dashboard, helping companies "sail through a compliance process" [01:43:48].
*   **Why Companies Care**: Compliance, which is "proof of security," is often driven by potential revenue, as it opens up new buyers for software who require security assurances [01:44:27]. Investing in security earlier also leads to long-term efficiency dividends [01:45:24].

## Vouch: Insurance for the Tech Industry
Vouch, another sponsor and `[[Key Investments in Tech Industry | investment]]` for the podcast hosts, is an insurance company specifically for the technology industry [01:23:31]. Co-founder Travis Hedge shared details.
*   **Services**: Vouch protects tech companies against litigation, theft, and cyber threats [01:24:45].
*   **Expansion**: Vouch launched in Washington state (Seattle) about 12 hours before the event, now covering 97% of US `[[venture_capital_strategies and the importance of optimism | venture activity]]` across 32 states, two and a half years after launching its first market [01:25:21]. This significantly streamlines the process of getting insurance for startups from months to minutes [01:25:48].
*   **Three Layers of Insurance**: Travis explained the industry's three layers:
    1.  **Distribution**: Brokers who sell insurance [01:26:41].
    2.  **Underwriting**: Designing the policies and assessing risks [01:26:43].
    3.  **Capacity**: The capital to pay claims [01:26:45].
*   **Vouch's Model**: Vouch initially started with distribution, but quickly realized the need to "own as much of the value chain as possible" to control decisions and innovate [01:27:04]. They created their own policies tailored for tech companies and partnered with a large reinsurance company for capacity [01:27:40]. Their focus on `[[history_and_strategy_of_technology_companies | venture-backed technology companies]]` allows them to go "super deep" in underwriting these specific risks, even if it means saying "no to a lot of business" [01:29:26].

## SoftBank Latin America Fund
The SoftBank Latin America Fund was highlighted for its `[[venture_capital_strategies and the importance of optimism | investment thesis]]` [01:31:17].
*   **Thesis**: The fund believed Latin America had innovative founders and great opportunities but lacked capital [01:31:19]. They were correct, deploying $8 billion into over 70 companies [01:31:33].
*   **Impact**: Technology in Latin America is about "inclusion" rather than disruption, addressing underserved populations in areas like banking, transportation, and e-commerce, and providing software solutions for businesses [01:31:41].
*   **Example**: Gympass, a portfolio company, helps employers offer gym access, therapy, and sleep guidance to employees globally through a network of over 50,000 gyms [01:32:00]. It's a "global software company built in Latin America" with double-digit month-over-month subscriber growth [01:32:12].

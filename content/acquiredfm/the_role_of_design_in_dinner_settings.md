At Benchmark, a significant tradition involves regular dinners, originating from a desire to inject new practices and ideas into the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This tradition was inspired by Bill Gurley reading a biography of Ben Franklin, who held four dinners a week focusing on various subjects like finance, chemistry, and life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The initial experiment with these dinners, particularly a large one in 2006 or 2007, was "amazing," creating a sense that "time stood still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Fostering Curiosity and Connection

The core concept behind these dinners is that firms, especially venture firms, are ultimately a collection of habits, and habits shape character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Nurturing curiosity, considered the essential lifeblood of the firm, required a specific habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. While Monday meetings attempt to achieve this, they are limited compared to the dynamic range of an open-ended, no-agenda dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. These dinners allow for wild explorations of bizarre topics partners might be curious about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The objective is to honor the firm's purpose of constant learning and activating curiosity, fostering a "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved in one-on-one settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Addressing Power Dynamics Through Table Design

A challenge inherent in traditional dining settings is the potential for a "dominant participant" when there's a head of the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Rectangular tables embed a power structure, while circular tables can atomize the group, making a unified conversation difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

To counteract this, the firm sought a table design that would [[the_role_of_unconventional_thinking_in_achieving_success | deconstruct power centers]] and create a non-hierarchical, intimate construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The inspiration came from Jean-Marie Massaud's "the seven" table, which was designed to be organic, expandable, and collapsible while disrupting traditional power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### The Ole Lundberg Table

This inspiration led to the firm's unique table, designed by Ole Lundberg, based on a hand-sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This specific design has allowed Ole Lundberg's lifestyle to significantly upgrade due to demand from others who desire a similar table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

The table's structure reflects the firm's ethos: it prevents sidebar conversations because everyone can hear everything, ensuring "it's all one conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This "one conversation element" is powerful, ensuring the entire group is "tuned in" to whatever is being discussed, whether good, bad, or tough news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Impact and Notable Guests

The dinners frequently include esteemed outside guests who are not necessarily investees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This includes figures like Dylan Field, Toby from Shopify, and Jeff Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. These interactions are described as being "swept off your feet," reinforcing the firm's purpose to serve people like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The dinner setting and the table's design contribute significantly to this experience, creating a "spotlight of attention" which is a "biggest gift you can give to another human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

This approach contrasts sharply with traditional venture capital practices, where an older partner might advise having "side conversations" with everyone before bringing something up at a partner meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Benchmark, in contrast, specifically has a rule against "pre-selling a deal," emphasizing that everything should be a shared, open conversation at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

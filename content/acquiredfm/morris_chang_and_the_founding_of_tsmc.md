[[Morris Changs career and influence | Dr. Morris Chang]], the 93-year-old founder of [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]], played a pivotal role in the company's [[Origins and history of TSMC | founding]] and its rise to become a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing. [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]] is now considered one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, with its success rooted in Chang's unique vision and strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>.

## Vision and Early Strategy: The Pure-Play Foundry Model
[[Morris Changs career and influence | Morris Chang]] founded [[Origins and history of TSMC | TSMC]] in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:35">[01:56:35]</a>, with the initial plan to establish a "dedicated Pure Play Foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:26">[02:22:26]</a>. This model was a significant departure from the integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | Intel]], which both designed and manufactured their chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>. Chang recognized that this specialization would allow [[TSMC]] to avoid competing with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a> and focus solely on manufacturing excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:07">[02:23:07]</a>.

Initially, [[TSMC]]'s customers were IDMs seeking to offload excess manufacturing capacity or produce less critical chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:05]</a>. Chang foresaw the emergence of "fabulous" companies—those that design chips but rely entirely on external foundries for manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a>. This vision was partly shaped by early encounters with entrepreneurs like Gordon Campbell, who sought funding for a company without a fabrication plant (fab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:33">[02:18:33]</a>.

## Strategic Investments and the Learning Curve
[[Morris Changs career and influence | Morris Chang]]’s background at Texas Instruments (TI), where he headed worldwide semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a> and worked closely with Bill Bain and Bruce Henderson (founder of Boston Consulting Group) on the learning curve theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:22">[02:08:22]</a>, heavily influenced [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]]'s long-term approach. The learning curve theory posits that as a company produces more of a product, its unit cost decreases due to gained experience and efficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:14">[02:03:14]</a>.

Key strategic decisions by [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] included:
*   **Consistent R&D Investment:** He mandated an R&D budget of 8% of revenue, regardless of economic conditions, ensuring continuous technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. This differed from his experience at TI, where his requests for increased R&D were denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Capital Expenditure:** In 2010, [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] made a significant "bet the company" move, increasing capital spending almost threefold to nearly $6 billion for the 28-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This decision, though questioned by the board, was based on internal forecasts and the belief that 28-nanometer would be a "sweet spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>, coinciding with the rise of the smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.
*   **Market Forecasting and Business Development:** [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] established strong market forecasting and business development departments to identify future demand and strategic opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.

These aggressive investments, guided by the learning curve principle, allowed [[TSMC]] to achieve economies of scale and maintain a competitive edge, driving down costs and enabling lower prices for customers, which in turn attracted more business and reinforced the virtuous cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>.

## Key Partnerships and Challenges

### [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Nvidia]]
[[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | TSMC]]'s relationship with [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Nvidia]] began in 1997 when [[Morris Changs career and influence | Morris Chang]] received a letter from Jensen Huang, [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Nvidia]]'s CEO, requesting [[TSMC]]'s foundry services after their San Jose office failed to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. At the time, [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Nvidia]] was a small, four-year-old company facing bankruptcy with only 50-60 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, while [[TSMC]] was already a billion-dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

[[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] personally met with Huang, who impressed him with his optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Huang boldly predicted that their chip would save [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Nvidia]] and make it a major [[TSMC]] customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, a prediction that came true within two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

In 2009, during a period when [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] had temporarily stepped down as CEO, [[TSMC]] faced yield and quality problems with its 40-nanometer node, affecting key customers like [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Upon returning as CEO, [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] prioritized resolving this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. He calculated an offer of over $100 million in compensation to [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, which was accepted within 48 hours, solidifying the long-term partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.

### [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]
[[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]]'s relationship with [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] began with an unexpected dinner invitation at [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]]'s home in Taipei, arranged by Foxconn founder Terry Gou (a relative of Chang's wife) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. The visitor was Jeff Williams, [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]'s Chief Operating Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. Williams immediately pitched [[TSMC]] on manufacturing [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]'s chips, stating they would offer a 40% gross margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>. However, [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] noted that [[TSMC]]'s margins were already 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>.

The major surprise was [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]'s request for a 20-nanometer node, a "half-step" detour from [[TSMC]]'s planned progression from 28-nanometer directly to 16-nanometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. This required significant additional capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>. [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] agreed to take on half of [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]'s requested demand, borrowing billions of dollars to fund the expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:29">[01:32:29]</a>.

[[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] also considered [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | Intel]] as a foundry partner in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:27">[01:37:27]</a>. [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] met with Tim Cook, who assured him that [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | Intel]] "just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This was interpreted by [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] as [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | Intel]]'s lack of customer trust and their established reputation for arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>, unlike [[TSMC]]'s dedicated customer-centric approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

Despite the 20-nanometer detour, which delayed [[TSMC]]'s 16-nanometer development and allowed Samsung to take initial 16-nanometer orders from [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>, [[TSMC]] ultimately secured the majority of [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Apple]]'s 16-nanometer requirements upon its readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. This highlights [[TSMC]]'s commitment to long-term customer relationships and its ability to adapt.

### [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | IBM]] and [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Qualcomm]]
In the 1990s, [[TSMC]] actively sought to acquire [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Qualcomm]] as a customer, recognizing them as a technology house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:08">[01:56:08]</a>. [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Qualcomm]] primarily used [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | IBM]] as its foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:45">[01:57:45]</a>. However, in the late 1990s, [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Qualcomm]]'s business with [[TSMC]] rapidly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>, signaling trouble for [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | IBM]]'s semiconductor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:41">[01:58:41]</a>.

This led [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | IBM]] to approach [[TSMC]] in 1999 for co-development of the next generation technology (.13 Micron/130 nanometer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:49">[01:59:49]</a>. [[Morris Changs career and influence | Morris Chang]] refused, anticipating that co-development with [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | IBM]] (who saw themselves as the senior partner) would compromise [[TSMC]]'s ability to develop its own processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>. [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | IBM]] then turned to [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | UMC]], who accepted but later regretted the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:45">[02:01:45]</a>.

## Management Philosophy
[[Morris Changs career and influence | Morris Chang]]'s management style was characterized by a focus on long-term vision and employee well-being.
*   **Against Layoffs:** In late 2008/early 2009, during a financial crisis and downturn in the [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | semiconductor industry]], a previous [[TSMC]] CEO laid off 600-700 employees based on performance reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>. [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]], who had never implemented layoffs during his tenure, saw this as a "knee-jerk reaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>. He believed performance reviews were subjective and that if employees would be rehired within a year, layoffs were counterproductive due to separation and training costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:01">[02:03:01]</a>. Upon retaking the CEO role, he offered to rehire all laid-off employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:08">[02:13:08]</a>.
*   **Empowering Leadership:** [[Morris Changs career and influence | Chang]] believed in allowing his CEOs to make their own mistakes to learn, intervening only if the company's survival was at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>. He also recognized the importance of a well-rounded executive, evidenced by his efforts to place the current CEO, C.C. Wei, in charge of Business Development to gain marketing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.

## The [[Role of TSMC in the technology ecosystem | Hsinchu Science Park]] Ecosystem
[[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]]'s success is deeply intertwined with the [[Role of TSMC in the technology ecosystem | Hsinchu Science Park]] in Taiwan, where its headquarters and many fabs are located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This park hosts [[TSMC]]'s partners and customers, including [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Cadence]], [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Synopsis]], [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | ARM]], [[TSMCs strategic partnerships and industry collaborations | Qualcomm]], and MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>. The close proximity fosters intense communication and collaboration, facilitating the rapid development and integration of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:31">[02:29:31]</a>. Additionally, two universities within the park produce PhDs who are directly absorbed into the ecosystem, creating a powerful talent pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>. This integrated environment is considered a unique and difficult-to-replicate factor in [[TSMC]]'s global dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:50">[02:30:50]</a>.

## An "Unlikely Success"
While [[Morris Changs career and influence | Morris Chang]] himself didn't view [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]]'s success as "unlikely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:55">[02:14:55]</a>, he admitted it "did exceed my expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>. The company's growth coincided with a massive expansion of the [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | semiconductor market]], which grew from $26 billion in 1987 to $527 billion in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>.

[[TSMC]]'s unique pure-play foundry model, combined with relentless investment in R&D and capital expenditure, and its strategic partnerships, allowed it to become the dominant player in an industry characterized by increasing complexity and cost of leading-edge manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>. This strategic position, coupled with the exponential demand for computing power driven by [[The impact of technological advancements on TSMCs growth | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a>, solidified [[TSMC]]'s position as a critical component of the global technology landscape.

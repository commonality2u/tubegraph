[[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]], the 93-year-old founder of [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]], is a pivotal figure in the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>. His vision and leadership transformed [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] into a global technology powerhouse, a [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | company]] that has grown to immense scale and importance, exceeding his initial expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>.

## The Genesis of [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]

[[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]] founded [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:35">[01:56:35]</a>, after a career that included leading worldwide semiconductors at [[texas_instruments | Texas Instruments]] (TI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:53">[03:59:53]</a>. His decision to create a dedicated Pure Play Foundry was a strategic move that set [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] apart from integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:06">[02:22:06]</a>. This model meant [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] would not compete with its customers, a fundamental philosophical difference from IDMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:41">[02:34:41]</a>.

### Foresight of the [[fabulous_industry | Fabless Industry]]

[[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]] foresaw the rise of [[fabulous_industry | fabless companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>. His insight was sparked by early interactions with entrepreneurs like Gordon Campbell, who sought funding to start companies without building their own fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a>. This indicated a future where specialized foundries would be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:40">[02:18:40]</a>.

## Business Philosophy and Strategic Decisions

[[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]]'s leadership at [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] was guided by several core principles:

### The Learning Curve Theory

[[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]] was a serious student of the learning curve theory, which posits that as a company makes more of a product, its unit cost goes down due to gained experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:14">[02:03:14]</a>. He refined this theory for the semiconductor industry, understanding that the goal is to become the largest volume player to achieve the lowest prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. This involves accelerating pricing in early stages, even potentially starting unprofitably, to outcompete and gain market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:40">[02:38:40]</a>.

### R&D and Capital Expenditure Strategy

Upon his return as CEO in 2009, [[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]] set [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s R&D budget at a fixed 8% of revenue, regardless of economic conditions, providing stability and encouraging big ideas within R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:30">[04:12:30]</a>. This decision, combined with a significant increase in capital expenditures (threefold in 2010 to almost $6 billion) for the 28 nanometer node, propelled [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] into a leadership role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:52">[04:29:52]</a>, betting heavily on what his R&D team called the "Sweet Spot" technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:05">[04:44:05]</a>. This strategic investment was made even without [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Apple]] in mind, as [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Apple]]'s business came as a "pleasant surprise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>.

### Customer Relationships and Crisis Management

[[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]] emphasized strong customer relationships and direct communication.

#### Handling the [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Nvidia]] 40nm Dispute

In 2009, upon retaking the CEO role, [[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]] faced a critical manufacturing and quality problem on the 40 nanometer node, significantly impacting customers like [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>. He personally resolved the dispute with [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Nvidia]] CEO [[jensen_huang | Jensen Huang]] by offering a settlement of over $100 million, after weeks of internal work to arrive at a fair number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:06">[03:04:06]</a>. This was presented with a 48-hour ultimatum, but [[jensen_huang | Jensen Huang]] accepted, preserving a crucial partnership that had begun with a letter from [[jensen_huang | Jensen Huang]] in 1997, seeking [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] as a foundry when [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Nvidia]] was a small, struggling company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

#### Securing the [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Apple]] Business

[[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s relationship with [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Apple]] began with a surprise dinner meeting at [[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]]'s home, arranged by [[terry_gou | Terry Gou]] of Foxconn, bringing [[jeff_williams | Jeff Williams]], [[apple]]'s COO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. [[jeff_williams | Jeff Williams]] pitched for [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] to produce chips on the 20 nanometer node, a half-step technology not in [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s original roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. Despite the significant investment required and initial financial challenges, [[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]] decided to take on half of [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Apple]]'s demand, funding it through corporate bonds rather than cutting dividends or issuing new stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>.

When Intel approached [[tim_cook | Tim Cook]] to consider their manufacturing for the iPhone, [[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]] wasn't overly worried, trusting [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s technology, manufacturing capabilities, and customer trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. [[tim_cook | Tim Cook]]'s explanation that "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" confirmed [[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Chang]]'s belief in [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s customer-centric approach, where every request is handled courteously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>. However, this detour for the 20nm node delayed [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s 16nm development, allowing Samsung to initially secure [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Apple]]'s first 16nm orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>. [[jeff_williams | Jeff Williams]] later reassured [[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Chang]] that [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Apple]] would buy from [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] once their 16nm was ready, which indeed happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:25">[01:54:25]</a>.

## Employee Relations

[[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Chang]]'s approach to human capital was characterized by loyalty and avoiding layoffs. During the 2008 financial crisis, when his successor laid off 600-700 employees based on "poor performance reviews," [[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Chang]] strongly disagreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:29">[01:53:29]</a>. He believed that layoffs by performance ratings were subjective and disrespectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. Upon his return, he offered to rehire everyone who was laid off and decided to keep the previous CEO in a new role, emphasizing long-term potential and avoiding public demotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>.

## The [[hsinchu_science_park | Hsinchu Science Park]] Ecosystem

[[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s success is deeply intertwined with the [[hsinchu_science_park | Hsinchu Science Park]] in [[geopolitical_risks_related_to_tsmc_and_taiwan | Taiwan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>. This government-sponsored industrial park hosts not just [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] but also its partners and customers, including companies like [[synopsis | Synopsis]], [[cadence | Cadence]], [[arm | ARM]], [[qualcomm | Qualcomm]], and [[mediatek | Mediatek]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>. The physical proximity fosters extremely close communication and collaboration, making it difficult to replicate elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:33">[02:29:33]</a>. The presence of two universities within the park, churning out PhDs absorbed directly into the ecosystem, further solidifies its unique advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

[[morris_changs_influence_and_leadership | Morris Chang]]'s commitment to the Pure Play Foundry model, aggressive R&D investment, and customer-centric approach allowed [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] to capitalize on [[moores_law | Moore's Law]] and the exponential growth of the semiconductor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a>. From 1987 to 2023, the global semiconductor market grew from $26 billion to $527 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>, a "ridiculous Tailwind" that [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] rode to become a trillion-dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. His leadership solidified [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s position as an indispensable player in global technology, making them the sole provider for many leading-edge chips, including all of [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Apple]]'s chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>.

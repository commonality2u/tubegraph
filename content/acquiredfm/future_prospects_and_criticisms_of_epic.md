Epic Systems, a privately held company based in rural Wisconsin, plays an enormous and often controversial role in the U.S. [[healthcare_industry_challenges_and_Epics_role | healthcare industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While lauded for its market dominance and integrated software, it also faces significant criticisms regarding its impact on healthcare professionals, interoperability, and market competition.

## Market Dominance and Business Model
Epic is an unusual company, known for doing no marketing or sales, often declining potential customers, refusing to negotiate or discount, never raising venture capital, and never doing acquisitions in its 47-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The company operates on a single gigantic campus in Verona, Wisconsin, featuring whimsical buildings designed to resemble the Land of Oz and New York's Grand Central Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

[[Epic systems overview | Epic Systems]] holds the majority of the U.S.'s major hospital systems as customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Out of over 600 customers, they have never permanently lost a single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The company's core database, Chronicles (created in the 1970s), remains the foundation for all its applications, including the clinical EMR (Epicare) and billing system (Resolute) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. This single, integrated database is considered a major reason for Epic's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

As of 2024, Epic had 607 customers, including 3,200 hospitals, serving 325 million patients worldwide (280 million in the U.S.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:36">[03:00:36]</a>. In 2024, their revenue was $5.7 billion, growing 16% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:14">[03:01:14]</a>. Epic's market share is 42% of hospitals, but because they serve the largest and most successful hospitals, they account for a larger share of all care performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:24">[03:05:24]</a>.

## Innovation and New Ventures
Epic's approach emphasizes continuous in-house development, with 35% of its operating expenses dedicated to R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:01">[03:20:01]</a>. This is comparable to Apple (36%) and only surpassed by Google (45%) among major tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:12">[03:20:12]</a>. The company's commitment to building everything itself rather than acquiring other companies or relying on extensive sales and marketing allows for this high R&D spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:37">[03:20:37]</a>.

### My Chart
Epic launched My Chart in 2000, a groundbreaking internet-based consumer-facing medical records access and interaction platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. This was considered "insanely innovative" for its time, providing patients direct access to their medical records and enabling self-scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. My Chart has 191 million active, de-duplicated users today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>.

### Cosmos and AI
Epic launched Cosmos a few years ago, a massive, anonymized database containing 295 million patients' worth of data from 15 billion individual patient encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:44">[02:56:44]</a>. This data is available for free to any contributing institution for research and other uses, such as identifying "lookalike patients" for rare conditions or informing clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:06">[02:59:06]</a>.

The digitization of records enables advanced applications. Epic's system reportedly prevented 66 million potential adverse drug interactions and 250,000 potential surgical errors in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:34">[02:57:34]</a>.

Looking forward, artificial intelligence (AI) presents significant opportunities, particularly in "ambient listening" to reduce the time doctors spend on EHRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:10">[03:38:10]</a>. Companies like Microsoft (Nuance), Abridge, and Suki are developing ambient AI products that integrate with Epic to act as scribes, allowing physicians to focus on patient interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:03">[03:39:03]</a>. Epic's position as a "choke point" in the industry means it largely dictates which software innovations reach hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:04">[03:40:04]</a>.

### International Expansion
Epic is starting to build its international market, which currently accounts for 10-15% of its business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:17">[02:51:17]</a>. In 2023, they went live at London's Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Trust, a major implementation in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:28">[02:50:28]</a>.

### Expansion to Payers and Pharma
Epic is expanding its customer base beyond health systems to include payers (insurers) and pharmaceutical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. An example is addressing prior authorizations, where Epic's scale and data could automate processes that are currently a significant burden on both providers and payers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:22">[02:54:22]</a>. The strategy is to leverage their existing asset base to sell to new customer types, seeking to become the single IT vendor for hospitals and then expanding to other players in the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:04">[02:55:04]</a>.

## Criticisms and Challenges

### Interoperability and "Information Blocking"
Epic has faced criticism for its perceived lack of interoperability, despite actively promoting its "Care Everywhere" system, which facilitates the exchange of 20 million patient records daily among Epic customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>. Judy Faulkner made Care Everywhere mandatory for all Epic customers, including competitors, by retrofitting old software versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:49">[02:09:49]</a>.

However, interoperability between Epic and other EHR systems (like [[other_topics_and_links | Cerner]] or Metatech) is more challenging due to different architectures and a lack of industry-wide standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:39">[02:06:39]</a>. There's a perceived lack of incentive for hospitals (who are competitors) or Epic itself to facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>. Third-party application integration has also historically been difficult, though this is changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:28">[02:08:28]</a>.

The Cures Act, passed in recent years, addresses "information blocking" by preventing EHRs or health systems from blocking access to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:11">[03:32:11]</a>. This act allows methods like screen scraping or Chrome extensions to extract data from Epic, despite Epic's long-standing emphasis on data privacy and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:34">[03:32:34]</a>.

### Impact on Healthcare Professionals
The 2009 HITECH Act, which incentivized EHR adoption, led to widespread digitization of healthcare records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:50">[02:14:50]</a>. While accelerating EHR usage (from 9% of hospitals in 2009 to 95% by 2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:24">[02:19:24]</a>, it also increased the regulatory burden of practicing medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:06">[02:25:06]</a>.

Critics argue that EHRs, including Epic's, can contribute to doctor burnout. A 2016 study found that entering data into EHRs consumes about 2 hours of doctor time for every 1 hour spent providing hands-on patient care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:0:07">[03:10:07]</a>. The shift to digital systems also meant that administrative tasks, previously delegated to medical assistants (e.g., ordering meds/scans), now strictly require doctor input due to tracking and compliance rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:46">[03:31:46]</a>. This increased workload has contributed to doctor burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:28">[03:32:28]</a>. Former President Obama also expressed disappointment that the legislation did not lead to the expected reduction in paperwork and administrative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:01">[03:33:01]</a>.

### Government Contracts and Competition
Epic has also been at the center of large, controversial government contracts. In 2015, the Department of Defense's global EHR contract (valued at $4.3 billion) was awarded to [[other_topics_and_links | Cerner]], as was the larger Veterans Administration (VA) contract (initially $10 billion) in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:32">[02:39:32]</a>.

These projects have faced massive delays and budget overruns. The DoD system only fully went live in late 2024, nine years after the contract was awarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. The VA system is projected to be fully live as "early as 2031," a 14-year project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:30">[02:41:30]</a>. This situation has been described as a "rat's nest of awfulness of bureaucracy," leading many to believe Epic was fortunate not to have won these deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:13">[02:43:13]</a>.

### Antitrust Lawsuits
Epic is known for its aggressive litigation strategy to defend its intellectual property and enforce employment practices like non-competes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:04">[03:24:04]</a>. They have also been embroiled in lawsuits with other health IT companies and are currently facing an antitrust lawsuit, accused of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:44">[03:24:44]</a>. Despite this, Epic has never been in a lawsuit or mediation with a customer, holding the customer relationship as sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:15">[03:25:15]</a>.

## Succession and Future Outlook
[[Judith Faulkner and Epics founding | Judy Faulkner]], Epic's founder and CEO, is 81 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:09">[02:29:09]</a>. She owns about half the company economically and 100% of the voting shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:26">[03:09:26]</a>. She has stated that the company will never go public or be acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>. Her succession plan involves transferring all voting shares into a "purpose trust" managed by her family, five long-time senior Epic managers, and three customer CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:51">[03:09:51]</a>. This trust's bylaws stipulate that the company can never be sold or taken public, and the next CEO must be a long-time Epic employee and a software developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:33">[03:10:33]</a>.

The company's estimated valuation, if public, is thought to be in the range of $100 billion, which would make Judy Faulkner the wealthiest self-made woman globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:31">[03:07:31]</a>.

Despite the criticisms, Epic's dominant position is reinforced by:
*   **Switching Costs:** The enormous cost and complexity of switching EHR systems for hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:48">[03:14:48]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies:** The ability to amortize massive R&D investments across a large customer base and offer comprehensive product suites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:22">[03:15:22]</a>.
*   **Network Economies:** The value derived from most other hospitals and new physicians being on Epic, facilitating record sharing and talent acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a>.
*   **Branding:** Its reputation as the most trusted and reliable vendor for prestigious institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:48">[03:17:48]</a>.
*   **Process Power:** Its highly structured software development methodology and training program for new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:21">[03:18:21]</a>.

The consolidation of hospital systems into larger entities also benefits Epic, as these mega-systems are more likely to adopt comprehensive solutions like Epic's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:36">[02:51:36]</a>. This trend is driven by the increasing compliance burden of practicing medicine, making scale necessary to afford it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:28">[02:51:28]</a>.

The long-term orientation of [[Epics competitive edge and business model | Epic's business model]], including consistent pricing (average 2% annual increase, below inflation) and bundling new modules at no additional cost, incentivizes customers to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:29">[01:57:29]</a>. This strategy aims to make choosing another vendor an "irrational and irresponsible decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:05]</a>.

The future of Epic suggests continued dominance in its core market, expansion into new healthcare segments like payers and pharma, and integration of emerging technologies like AI to further streamline healthcare operations.

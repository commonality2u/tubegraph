The shift of the database market to cloud-based solutions has been a significant theme over the last decade, driven by the view that not all software is created equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Database Market

In 2000, the database sector was the largest in software, with companies principally deriving revenue from databases having an aggregated enterprise value of approximately a trillion dollars in market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Future of Data and Decision Making

A crucial driver for the evolution of software and infrastructure is the exponential growth of data. More data is produced annually than in all previous years of human history combined, necessitating new storage solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. As more sensors are built to gather data, the question of where this data will reside becomes paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Bill Gates once highlighted the "barbaric" nature of current decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He envisioned a future where vast amounts of stored data would be analyzed by machines to facilitate better decisions across various domains, including:
*   Diagnosing illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Educating dyslexic children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Maintaining aircraft engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

These predictions underscore a future where decisions are primarily made by machines interpreting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Cloud's Role in Enterprise Transformation

There has been a strong conviction that the entire database market would be remade in the cloud, specifically purpose-built for [[understanding_aws_and_cloud_computing_fundamentals | cloud computing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This perspective led to a significant focus on the [[understanding_aws_and_cloud_computing_fundamentals | cloud infrastructure]] layer and the necessary enablement for [[the_impact_of_brand_building_in_enterprise_software | enterprises]] to migrate to the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This focus proved to be a "rich vein" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

[[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] is recognized as a "Disneyland of consumer value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, offering a wide array of products from cashews and eyeglasses to car tires and diamonds, along with a consistently priced hot dog and soda combo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The company's apparent simplicity—selling in bulk to offer great deals—masks around 50 clever innovations refined over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Every aspect of [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]], from its wide parking spaces to its rotisserie chickens, is intentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

[[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] is known for providing extremely great value to customers on high-quality products at the lowest possible prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This approach has led to consistent revenue growth of about 10% for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Its revenue per square foot rivals high-end retailers, and its private label, [[Costcos business model and growth | Kirkland Signature]], generates more revenue than all of [[Costcos business model and growth | Nike]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## Origins: The Influence of Saul Price

The true history of [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] dates back further than its 1983 founding, deeply rooted in the work of Saul Price, a legendary figure in retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:5:40]</a>. Saul Price's companies, FedMart and Price Club, were foundational, with [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] itself being the result of a merger with Price Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Many of [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]]'s principles and innovations are "stacked learnings" from Price's ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

Saul Price was born in 1916 in the Bronx, New York, to Jewish immigrants from Belarus who worked in garment factories with terrible conditions, influencing his strong social and political ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. He developed an eye defect that made him an overachiever in school, skipping two grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. His family moved to San Diego during his high school years, where he met his future wife, Helen Moskowitz, whose family owned a prosperous scrap metal business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. San Diego's growth during and after World War II positioned it as a fertile market for retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.

Price became a lawyer, counseling entrepreneurs in the burgeoning post-war San Diego retail scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. He observed businesses like the Seven Seas Locker Club, which used a locker premise to draw consumers into a store offering various goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. He also noted FedCo, a non-profit [[The role of memberships and consumer value at Costco | membership]] club in Los Angeles open only to federal employees, pooling buying power for better prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>. FedCo became very popular, with customers driving hundreds of miles to shop there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.

### FedMart: The Birth of the Discounter
Seeing FedCo's success, Saul Price and his partners tried to establish a FedCo franchise in San Diego using a vacant 21,000-square-foot warehouse owned by his wife's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>. After FedCo declined the partnership, Price and his partners opened their own store in November 1954, naming it FedMart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. This name influenced future discounters like [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] and Kmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>.

FedMart was a for-profit company, unlike FedCo, and was the first scaled "discounter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>. At the time, laws prohibited retailers from selling products below manufacturers' minimum prices to the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. Price discovered that by operating as a [[The role of memberships and consumer value at Costco | membership]] club, they were not open to the "general public," thus circumventing these laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:28:00">[23:28:00]</a>. Saul Price is credited with inventing both the discounter and the wholesale club model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>.

FedMart's first store in San Diego was an immediate success, generating \$3 million in sales in its first year, far exceeding expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>. They quickly expanded to Phoenix, then Texas, with lines of customers extending for half a mile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. Saul Price then ceased practicing law to become FedMart's president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>.

Key innovations and philosophies at FedMart, which later influenced [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]]:
*   **Hiring Jim Sinegal**: In 1954, Price hired a young college student, Jim Sinegal, as a part-time bagger in the San Diego store. Sinegal would work for FedMart for 22 years, eventually running its distribution and centralized warehousing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>.
*   **Expanded Offerings**: FedMart added gasoline, intentionally pricing it a few cents lower to drive traffic to the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>. They also added pharmacies, facing threats from the industry due to undercutting prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a>.
*   **House Brand**: FedMart developed its own house brand, "FM brand," for popular products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:45:00">[27:45:00]</a>.
*   **Foundational Principles**: Saul Price codified "FedMart's Four Priority Order Principles":
    1.  Provide the best possible value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>.
    2.  Pay good wages and provide good benefits to employees (revolutionary for the 1950s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>.
    3.  Maintain honest business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>.
    4.  Make money for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>.
    These principles prioritized customer and employee well-being over short-term profits, a stark contrast to other retailers like [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:00">[29:37:00]</a>. Price's policy was to not use loss leaders or mark up goods excessively, believing it treated customers "like they're stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:27:00">[30:27:00]</a>.

FedMart's emphasis on employee well-being resulted in low turnover (7% attrition at [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] today vs. 20% typical retail) and minimal "shrinkage" (unaccounted merchandise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>. The company also promoted internally, leading to long tenures for senior management, including Jim Sinegal and Craig Jelinek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14:00">[33:14:00]</a>.

### The Rise of Price Club
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, Saul Price was looking for a capital partner for FedMart to compete with larger discounters like Kmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:00">[38:08:00]</a>. He explored "hypermarkets" in Europe, a new concept combining general merchandise with full-scale grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>. However, a partnership with German retailer Hugo Mann ended poorly, with Mann firing Price and his son Robert, and FedMart ultimately failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:45:00">[40:45:00]</a>.

Incensed at being ousted from his own company at 60 years old, Saul Price, along with his son Robert, decided to start a new venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. They focused on the centralized warehousing operations that Jim Sinegal had run at FedMart, realizing the potential for a wholesale business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:48:00">[43:48:00]</a>. This new concept, Price Club, aimed to create warehouses for other small businesses (gas stations, restaurants, small stores) to buy inventory in bulk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:00">[44:57:00]</a>. The key insight was that manufacturers would deliver directly to the warehouse, eliminating logistical costs like running trucks or additional storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:02:00">[47:02:00]</a>.

Price Club charged a real membership fee, providing value by simplifying inventory management for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:49:00">[47:49:00]</a>. They limited their stock to about 3,000 high-volume items, a non-consensus move compared to Walmarts and Kmarts, which stocked around 50,000 SKUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:00]</a>. This low SKU count would become a cornerstone of their efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:51:00">[59:51:00]</a>.

The first Price Club, opened in 1976 in San Diego, initially struggled to attract businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:45:00">[49:45:00]</a>. A turning point came when they partnered with the San Diego City Credit Union, allowing its members to access "group memberships" at slightly higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:30:00">[50:30:00]</a>. This unexpectedly opened the doors to consumers, leading to viral word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:18:00">[51:18:00]</a>. This proved that consumers were willing to shop in a warehouse environment directly from pallets if the prices were low enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:50:00">[54:50:00]</a>.

The famous [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] hot dog and soda deal for \$1.50 originated from hot dog vendors wanting to set up carts outside the first Price Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:48:00">[52:48:00]</a>. Price Club decided to offer it themselves, ensuring it remained at \$1.50 for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:06:00">[53:06:00]</a>.

Price Club's [[Costcos business model and growth | business model]] was a "cash flow geyser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10:00">[56:10:00]</a>. Suppliers delivered products directly to warehouses and invoiced Price Club on "net 30" terms. Goods were often sold to customers before Price Club had to pay the supplier, creating a "negative cash conversion cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:56:00">[56:56:00]</a>. This meant vendors effectively financed [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]]'s inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:25:00">[58:25:00]</a>. The low SKU count (now 3,800 at [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]]) ensured faster inventory turnover, making this possible without predatory supplier terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:51:00">[59:51:00]</a>.

Price Club went public in 1979, not through an IPO, but because its share buying and selling activity crossed the SEC's 500-shareholder threshold, requiring it to file as a public company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.

## The Founding of Costco

In 1982, [[History and evolution of Walmart | Sam Walton]], founder of [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]], visited Saul Price to learn about the Price Club model, leading to the creation of Sam's Club within 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. Around the same time, Bernie Marcus, founder of Home Depot, also visited Price Club and received the playbook for his own hardware store concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

Also in 1982, Seattle retailers Bernie Brotman and his son Jeff approached Saul Price about opening a Price Club franchise in Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>. After Price Club declined, the Brotmans decided to clone the model themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. Jeff Brotman cold-called Price Club's head of merchandising, who, being Saul Price's nephew, declined but recommended Jim Sinegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. Sinegal, Saul Price's protégé and former head of FedMart's warehousing, was convinced to move to Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

Jim Sinegal and the Brotmans raised \$7.5 million and recruited eight experienced individuals, mostly from FedMart and Price Club, to start [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. Their [[Costcos business model and growth | business model]] was a direct clone of Price Club, with Sinegal at the helm, known for his focus on detail and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. The first [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] warehouse opened in Seattle in 1983, followed by Portland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] reached \$1 billion in revenue in less than three years, and \$3 billion in under six years, becoming the first company to hit that milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. They went public in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>.

## The Merger: Price/Costco

By 1993, Price Club, while doing fine, was not expanding as aggressively as [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] or Sam's Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>. In June 1993, [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] and Price Club merged to form Price/Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. Saul Price preferred a merger with Jim Sinegal, seeing him as the natural successor, over a potential acquisition by [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

The transaction was structured as a near-merger of equals, with [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] shareholders receiving 52% of the combined company's equity and Price Club shareholders receiving 48% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>. Jim Sinegal became the CEO of the combined entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>. At the time of the merger, both companies had around 100 stores each, with combined revenue of approximately \$16 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.

The merger was also driven by the need to compete with [[History and evolution of Walmart | Walmart]]'s aggressive expansion of Sam's Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. After the merger, the combined Price/Costco was only slightly larger than Sam's Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>. Saul Price passed away in 2009 at 93, having devoted his later life to philanthropy and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.

## Key Enduring Strategies and Culture

Following the merger, [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] continued to refine its [[Costcos business model and growth | business model]], incorporating several key elements:

*   **Kirkland Signature**: Around the time of the merger, [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] launched its private label, [[Costcos business model and growth | Kirkland Signature]], named after its former corporate headquarters in Kirkland, Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>. This brand aimed to provide a certain level of quality at a lower price than national brands, and it now accounts for nearly a quarter of [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]]'s top line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:51">[01:37:51]</a>.
*   **International Expansion**: [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] began expanding [[International expansion and future growth potential for Costco | internationally]], first to the UK, then to Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, proving that its bulk warehouse model could succeed even in dense urban environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:13]</a>.
*   **Low Selection & High Quality**: [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] operates on the premise that customers don't need extensive selection as long as available items are high quality and offer great value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>. This "intelligent loss of sales" philosophy, inherited from Saul Price's FedMart days, allows for simplified logistics and lower overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:41">[01:43:41]</a>.
*   **Membership Economics**: The [[The role of memberships and consumer value at Costco | membership]] model (e.g., the \$60 basic and \$120 executive [[The role of memberships and consumer value at Costco | memberships]]) not only generates significant, high-margin revenue but also encourages members to shop more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:19">[01:51:19]</a>. Executive members, who pay double, receive 2% cash back and represent 73% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:29">[01:56:29]</a>. The 93% U.S. [[The role of memberships and consumer value at Costco | membership]] renewal rate is exceptionally high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:21">[01:57:21]</a>.
*   **Supplier Relationships and Pricing**: [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] maintains a strict 14% maximum markup on products (15% for Kirkland Signature), ensuring extreme value for members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:31">[02:27:31]</a>. Their [[Costcos supplier relationships and pricing strategy | supplier relationships]] are tough but fair, as they deeply understand commodity prices and insist on passing savings to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Cash-Flow Efficiency**: The negative cash conversion cycle, where goods are sold before suppliers are paid, contributes significantly to [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]]'s financial strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
*   **Cross-Docking Logistics**: [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] uses a highly efficient cross-dock system for 92% of its merchandise, where goods move directly from supplier trucks to [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] trucks for stores, minimizing storage and handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:30">[01:47:30]</a>.
*   **Vertical Integration**: [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] selectively vertically integrates when it can provide better value to members. For example, they own and operate a chicken processing plant in Nebraska to control costs and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:59">[02:27:59]</a>.
*   **Culture**: [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]]'s culture emphasizes obedience to the law, care for members and employees, and respect for [[Costcos supplier relationships and pricing strategy | suppliers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This long-term, disciplined approach, exemplified by executives like Jim Sinegal visiting every store annually, fosters high employee loyalty and consistent execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:50">[02:53:50]</a>.

Today, [[Costcos business model and growth | Costco]] is the third-largest retailer in the US, with 124 million members worldwide and 860 stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Its unique [[Costcos business model and growth | business model]] and unwavering commitment to its core principles continue to drive its success and set it apart in the retail landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

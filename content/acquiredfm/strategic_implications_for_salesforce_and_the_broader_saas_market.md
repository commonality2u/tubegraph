The acquisition of Slack by Salesforce for $27.7 billion marks a significant event with wide-ranging strategic implications for both Salesforce and the broader SaaS (Software as a Service) market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Salesforce's Strategic Rationale

Salesforce's acquisition of Slack is primarily a [[salesforce_acquisition_of_slack | distribution deal]], aiming to leverage Salesforce's extensive sales force to penetrate larger organizations that Slack has struggled to reach independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The stated goal is to combine Slack with "Salesforce Customer 360" to create "the operating system for the new way to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Slack Connect, which facilitates communication between companies, is seen as a particularly appealing feature for Salesforce, potentially integrating directly into the sales process within the Salesforce product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

This move aligns with a strategy of growing by acquisition, particularly by acquiring high-growth assets to boost overall revenue in a core business with growth that may not be considered "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Salesforce has historically pursued acquisitions, including their attempt to acquire LinkedIn, which Microsoft ultimately purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The Microsoft Factor

The acquisition is deeply intertwined with the ongoing competition with Microsoft. Microsoft Teams has been positioned as Slack's primary competitor, aggressively calling out Slack by name and leveraging its bundling with Office 365 to gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Microsoft's significant [[enterprise_software_market_and_servicenows_role | enterprise software]] distribution channel and its "full integrated system" approach threaten Slack's position as a standalone "best of breed" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

Some interpret Salesforce's move as an attempt to form an "anti-Microsoft alliance" or "best of breed alliance," where Salesforce acts as a credible centerpiece for a suite of specialized software products that collectively compete with Microsoft's integrated offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Broader SaaS Market Dynamics

### Rebundling of Enterprise Software

The acquisition suggests a potential shift towards the "rebundling of [[enterprise_software_market_and_servicenows_role | enterprise sales]]" after an era where individual teams could easily acquire various SaaS services using credit cards, leading to "subscription fatigue" for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This consolidation aims to alleviate procurement pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

While the "rebundling" may not occur in the same way as traditional [[microsofts_business_strategies_and_market_influence | Microsoft]] bundles, it could manifest at the corporate card level or through new software solutions that manage spend, rather than companies opting for single-vendor solutions like Microsoft or Oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Impact on "Best of Breed" Companies

The deal could create tailwinds for other "subscale" software and productivity companies (those not on the scale of Microsoft or Salesforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Salesforce's potential push for a "best of breed" narrative could make companies like Box or Dropbox more strategic, either as acquisition targets or through enhanced distribution partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Collaboration Tools

The emergence of "deep collaboration" tools, such as Figma or Notion, that integrate chat and collaboration directly into their platforms, poses a long-term threat to standalone chat applications like Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. If work increasingly happens directly within these specialized applications, a central communication hub like Slack could become relegated to more general announcements or emergency use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

The acquisition also raises questions about [[strategic_vision_and_business_pivots_in_the_tech_industry | Slack's strategic vision]] and whether it implicitly admits defeat in the face of Microsoft's competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. While Slack's business metrics remained strong, the perceived threat from Microsoft Teams and a flat stock price likely made the 55% acquisition premium highly attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. The deal allows Stewart Butterfield to continue focusing on product vision without the pressures of independent sales and competing directly against Microsoft's vast distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

The strategic landscape suggests a battle between Microsoft's established integrated suite and Salesforce's ambition to become the credible centerpiece of a "best of breed" ecosystem, potentially leading to further consolidation or new models of software distribution and consumption.

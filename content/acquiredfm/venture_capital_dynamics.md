## Introduction to Venture Capital Dynamics
Venture Capital (VC) involves unique challenges, particularly in generating massive, outsized returns from investing in only a handful of truly important companies each decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. An even greater challenge is maintaining this success across different generations of partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This article explores the [[Venture Capital Models and Partnerships]] of firms like Benchmark, which have navigated these complexities and achieved sustained success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Early 1990s Venture Capital Landscape
In the early 1990s, the [[Venture capital industry dynamics]] were significantly different from today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. There were approximately 100 times fewer venture capitalists than there are now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Businesses also had different economics, lacking the high gross margins, large addressable markets, or zero distribution costs that define modern big tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Valuations were considerably lower; for instance, Google's Series A valuation was $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Kleiner Perkins' Dominance
John Doerr's Kleiner Perkins was the dominant force in the VC ecosystem, particularly leading up to and during the internet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Doerr had a track record of successful investments including Compaq, Intuit, Sun, Netscape, Amazon, and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Kleiner Perkins operated with Doerr as the unquestioned leader, functioning as the firm's CEO and best player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Another distinct aspect of the Kleiner Perkins model was the adoption of a "modern *keiretsu*" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This meant facilitating or even forcing partnerships and business development relationships among their portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This model made sense in the proto-internet ecosystem of the 1990s, where distribution was crucial and product-market fit was less organic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

Other notable firms included Sequoia (which was growing but not yet dominant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, Greylock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, Venrock (originally the Rockefeller family office's venture arm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>, and IVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

### Pre-Benchmark Firms: TVI and Merrill Pickard
Two lesser-known firms, Technology Venture Investors (TVI) and Merrill Pickard Anderson and Eyre, shared an office building on Sand Hill Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. TVI gained significant prominence as the sole VC investor in Microsoft, investing $1 million for 5% of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Merrill Pickard had success with investments like Palm Pilot and Rambus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

These firms, led by senior partners who had made substantial money, began to face internal discussions about their structure and the distribution of rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

## Economics of a Venture Firm
The economics of a venture firm involve multiple parts:
*   **Fund Carry:** The straightforward percentage of net profits that partners receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Management Company:** An LLC typically owned by the founding partners, serving as the umbrella entity for the firm and its funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   **Fees:** A 2% annual management fee paid to the management company for managing LPs' money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. This covers salaries and operational budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   **Carry Distribution:** Typically 20% of profits after LPs receive their initial capital back (1x return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.

A common issue in older firms was that while junior partners might receive carry in future funds, they were often excluded from ownership of the management company, limiting their governance and access to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

## The Birth of Benchmark: An Equal Partnership
Amidst this dynamic, a strong sentiment for an "equal partnership" emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Bob Kagle, a partner at TVI with a "religious fervor" for equal partnership, felt it was morally wrong for a VC firm to operate otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Kagle, who grew up in Flint, Michigan, and was the first in his family to attend college (General Motors University), felt the older generation was holding onto economic keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

TVI ultimately decided to "declare victory" and close down, as internal discussions on structural changes failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Dave Marquardt, who led TVI's Microsoft investment, went on to found August Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. Marquardt's investment style, which emphasized the personal relationship aspect of venture and believed companies should handle their own "value-added services," was a precursor to Benchmark's philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.

Kagle then approached Bruce Dunlevie from Merrill Pickard, suggesting they start a new firm based on equal partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Dunlevie, initially hesitant due to lack of a safety net, later agreed when similar internal discussions at Merrill Pickard faltered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. Bruce and Andy Rachleff (also from Merrill Pickard) joined Kagle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. They then recruited Kevin Harvey, an entrepreneur who had successfully sold two companies, as their fourth partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. Val Vaden, a former venture capitalist focused on buyouts, joined as the fifth founding member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

In late 1994, these five partners launched Benchmark Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. They adopted an audacious name, signaling their aspiration to "set a new Benchmark for performance" in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. Their prospectus prominently stated, "There is always room at the top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. They also broke industry norms by charging 30% carry (vs. the standard 20%), positioning themselves as a premium product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.

This "premium carry" approach caused significant division among LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>. While some, like Horsley Bridge, made a significant bet on them and became long-term LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>, others, notably Stanford University's endowment, actively organized against them and blackballed Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>.

## The Early Years and First Major Successes
The initial years (1995-1996) were challenging for Benchmark. They missed significant opportunities like Amazon and Yahoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>, and internal dynamics were not gelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>. Val Vaden, the fifth partner, left the firm in late 1996 due to a mismatch in investment styles (his buyout background versus Benchmark's focus on formation-stage tech and internet companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. Benchmark maintained a very generous separation, even keeping Val on their website temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>.

### Re-injecting Swagger: David Beirne and Webvan
To regain momentum, Benchmark recruited David Beirne in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Beirne was the top executive recruiter in Silicon Valley, known for his aggressive, "swaggerful" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. Beirne's first major deal was Webvan, an ambitious e-commerce grocery delivery service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

[!INFO] Webvan Investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>
Benchmark and Sequoia co-led a $7 million Series A investment, with each firm investing $3.5 million for roughly 10% of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. While Webvan famously went bust in the dot-com crash, at its peak, it reached an $8 billion market cap, turning Benchmark's $3.5 million into $800 million on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. This was a "great bet to make" in venture, representing the kind of asymmetric upside and downside risk-taking that builds premier firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

### The Game-Changer: eBay
1997 proved to be the "Annus Mirabilis" (year of miracles) for Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. The firm's biggest win came from eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. Pierre Omidyar, an engineer who had previously worked with Bruce Dunlevie at a pen computing company called Ink, started AuctionWeb (later eBay) as a side project while at General Magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. When his server costs rose due to traffic, he reluctantly asked users to pay a small listing fee, leading to an overwhelming influx of checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

Despite eBay already being profitable and growing at 10% per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>, and receiving a $50 million acquisition offer from Knight Ridder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>, most other VCs turned them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>. Benchmark, however, saw the potential. The entire partnership, including Bob Kagle (interested in consumer psychology) and David Beirne (who could bring in management talent like Meg Whitman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>, worked together.

Benchmark invested $6.7 million in a Series A at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. Crucially, they also offered equity-backed loans (effectively a secondary) totaling $1.5 million to Omidyar and Jeff Skoll, incentivizing them not to sell the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. This non-consensus and untraditional approach was later seen as a "great use case" for allowing entrepreneurs to take money off the table and aim for much larger outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>.

By September 1998, just over a year after investment, and with Meg Whitman as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:43">[01:22:43]</a>, Benchmark's $6.7 million stake in eBay was worth $400 million at IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. By the time the lockup expired in spring 1999, it was worth over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. This single investment, from an $85 million fund, generated billions in returns for LPs, making Fund I one of the best-performing venture funds in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.

The rapid appreciation of eBay's value was due to two factors: the financial markets "woke up to the power of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>, and Benchmark recognized that despite its unconventional appearance (poor UI, "beanie babies" business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>, the company's numbers showed it was already working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>.

## The Equal Partnership Model in Practice
Benchmark's "equal partnership" model, where all partners have equal carry and ownership of the management company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>, generated both significant advantages and unique [[Challenges and dynamics of venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### Advantages:
*   **Unbelievable Trust:** The model fostered a culture where partners had no incentive to claim individual credit, forcing competitive individuals to act as a cohesive team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>.
*   **Founder-Centricity:** Unlike firms where senior partners might hand off board seats, Benchmark's model meant active partners were deeply involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">[01:39:58]</a>. They didn't impose a "keiretsu" structure; rather, they provided full firm support to entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:24">[01:39:24]</a>.
*   **Focus on the "Game on the Field":** Partners spent 90-95% of their time on investments and supporting portfolio companies, rather than managing the firm or their individual careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:12">[02:20:12]</a>.
*   **Psychological Safety for Partners:** The deep trust allowed partners to make risky decisions without fear of conflict or negative impact on their standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:46">[01:47:46]</a>. This psychological safety extends to the [[Entrepreneur and Venture Capitalist Relationship]], where board meetings are not pitches and conflicts of interest (e.g., from an internal growth fund) are minimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:37">[03:36:37]</a>.

### Challenges and Unique Traits:
*   **High Bar for Entry:** For the model to work, every active General Partner must bring equal value, effort, and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:02">[01:46:02]</a>. This creates a "very narrow pool to fish in" for new partners, typically requiring someone who is already a highly successful venture capitalist in their 30s, fiercely competitive, and an unbelievable teammate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>.
*   **Mediocrity Risk ("Communist Capital"):** Critics initially dubbed it "communist capital," arguing that if everyone is responsible, no one is, leading to mediocrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:22">[01:45:22]</a>. This risk is especially high if partners are not equally contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>.
*   **Retirement Imperative:** The implicit expectation of constant, 100% effort means partners typically retire or step back once they're no longer "bringing it" at that level, often in their late 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:53">[01:46:53]</a>.
*   **Delicate Equilibrium:** The partnership operates on a "knife point" of trust, requiring extremely delicate handling of hard conversations, especially during dry spells or performance dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a>.

## The Imperial Era: Expansion and Mistakes (1999-2005)
Post-eBay success, Benchmark faced new decisions. With partners now multi-millionaires, the firm debated scaling up, raising larger funds, hiring junior partners, or forming corporate joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. Counterintuitively, despite their current anti-scaling reputation, Benchmark "tried everything" during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:07">[02:00:07]</a>.

*   **Fund Size Increase:** They raised a $1 billion fourth fund (up from $85 million for Fund I) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">[02:17:59]</a>.
*   **International Expansion:** They expanded to Europe (raising a $750 million fund, later cut to $500 million) and Israel (raising a $220 million fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:30">[02:18:30]</a>. These were structured as separate, equal partnerships licensing the Benchmark brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:17">[02:19:17]</a>.
*   **Corporate Network:** They even created a "corporate network" of executives from Fortune 500 companies to facilitate partnerships for their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>.

### Missed Opportunities
This expansion, however, led to significant missed opportunities ("sins of omission"):
*   **Google (1999):** Benchmark declined to pursue Google with their usual "hyper-competitiveness," a major regret for Bill Gurley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:40">[02:22:40]</a>.
*   **Skype (early 2000s):** Due to internal confusion and potential hand-offs between the Menlo Park and Europe funds, Benchmark missed the deal for Skype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:27">[02:24:27]</a>.
*   **Facebook (2004-2005):** Benchmark was conflicted out of the Facebook Series A because they had invested in Friendster, another social networking company, and their board member (Bob Kagle) was blocked from pursuing Facebook by Friendster's CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:06">[02:26:06]</a>.

These misses and the general "wandering in the woods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:27">[02:28:27]</a> during this period led to questions about Benchmark's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:54">[02:28:54]</a>.

## The Fab Four Era: A Refounding (2006-2017)
Around 2004-2005, the partners decided to return to their core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">[02:30:28]</a>. They spun off their international operations (Europe became Balderton Capital, Israel became Vintage Investment Partners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a> and refocused on early-stage investing in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">[02:30:28]</a>.

Crucially, the first wave of original partners, including David Beirne and Andy Rachleff, stepped back from active GP roles in 2005-2006, relinquishing ownership in the management company and not taking carry in new funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:02">[02:31:02]</a>. This was a clean break, upholding the founding principle of equal partnership for active members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:51">[02:31:51]</a>.

The core partners remaining were Bruce Dunlevie, Bob Kagle, Kevin Harvey, and Bill Gurley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:38">[02:33:38]</a>. To "re-inject giddy up," they began recruiting a new generation of "hitter after hitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:59">[02:32:59]</a>.

*   **Bill Gurley:** Joined in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:23">[02:12:23]</a>, fitting the "narrow box" for Benchmark partners (early 30s, established track record, fiercely competitive, unbelievable teammate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>. Gurley, a former engineer and Wall Street analyst, became known for his analytical approach to marketplaces (OpenTable, Zillow, GrubHub, Uber) and his "calvinist work ethic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>.
*   **Peter Fenton:** Joined from Accel Partners (which had just done Facebook) as the first of the new blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:26">[02:33:26]</a>. He was an early 30s "baby GP" with an established track record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:25">[02:35:25]</a>. Fenton made a difficult decision to walk away from Facebook fund economics at Accel to join Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. His investments include Twitter, Docker, New Relic, and Elastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:51">[02:37:51]</a>.
*   **Mitch Lasky:** An "unsung part" of the Fab Four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:02">[02:39:02]</a>, Lasky was a founder and CEO in the games industry, having led Jamdat (a mobile games company) to IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:09">[02:39:09]</a>. His notable investments include Snap and Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:54">[02:40:54]</a>.
*   **Matt Cohler:** Hired directly from Facebook (employee #5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:11">[02:41:11]</a>, Cohler had deep expertise in consumer social products and "knew the future" of mobile advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:28">[02:41:28]</a>. He famously stated, "Our job as venture capitalists is not to see the future but to see the present very clearly," reflecting the new era of data-driven Series A investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">[02:43:02]</a>. His investments include Instagram and Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:09">[02:46:09]</a>.

This "Fab Four" (Bill Gurley, Peter Fenton, Mitch Lasky, Matt Cohler) became the core of Benchmark Fund VII (2011), a $550 million fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:25">[02:47:25]</a>. This fund became one of the best-performing of its size, with a reported 25x return before fees by 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:08">[02:50:08]</a>. Its investments included Uber, Snap, Discord, Stitch Fix, Duo Security, Docker, Elastic, Nextdoor, and WeWork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:13">[02:51:13]</a>.

[!QUOTE] The Benchmark Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:08">[02:53:08]</a>
A Forbes article in March 2015, at the "apex" of this era, proclaimed "The Benchmark Way: Five partners who make other VC firms look outgunned and overstaffed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:51">[02:52:51]</a>. On average, each partner took one board seat per year, investing at Series A and often owning 15-25% of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:46">[02:53:46]</a>.

## The Uber Saga and its Implications
Benchmark's investment in Uber (2011) was a $10 million Series A at a $60 million post-money valuation, one of the first investments from Fund VII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:32">[02:56:32]</a>. Bill Gurley had been actively searching for a company like Uber, even trying to convert Taxi Magic into the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:03">[02:56:03]</a>. At its peak, Benchmark's holding in Uber was valued at $8 billion, making it the bulk of Fund VII's returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:08">[02:54:08]</a>.

However, Uber faced a series of controversies, including the "delete Uber" campaign, the Susan Fowler allegations of sexism, and a general public perception of an uncompromising stance towards regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:11">[03:00:11]</a>. The sheer scale of Uber's private market valuation (reaching $70-80 billion) created immense pressure on all stakeholders, from LPs to employees, to ensure a successful IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:01">[03:04:01]</a>.

Benchmark, with Bill Gurley on the board, famously sued Uber's founder, Travis Kalanick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:19">[03:00:19]</a>. While this was seen by some as an existential risk to Benchmark's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:48">[03:06:48]</a>, it arguably caused the "Yoko Ono moment" for the "Fab Four" era, leading to partners retiring earlier than they might have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:40">[03:09:40]</a>.

## The Current Benchmark Partnership
The transition out of the Fab Four era saw Matt Cohler and Mitch Lasky step back by Fund IX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:11">[03:10:11]</a>, and Bill Gurley also stepped back after one more fund cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:16">[03:10:16]</a>.

## Analysis of Benchmark's Distinctive Model
Benchmark's model stands as a "perfect and pure illustration of counter positioning" in the [[Venture capital industry dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:01">[03:28:01]</a>. Unlike firms that had powerful senior GPs unwilling to share economics or those not set up for equal value employees, Benchmark's founding principles demanded it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:11">[03:28:11]</a>.

*   **Branding and Valuation:** Benchmark's "American green dollars cost a lot more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:28">[03:32:28]</a>. Entrepreneurs often take deals with Benchmark at lower valuations for the same amount of money because of the firm's brand value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:42">[03:32:42]</a>. This value includes access to smart partners, extensive networks, and a near 100% guarantee of securing a Series B round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:42">[03:33:42]</a>.
*   **"Correct Non-Consensus" Bets:** A core philosophy across generations at Benchmark is to be "both non-consensus and right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:52">[03:15:52]</a>. They identify opportunities that others overlook (e.g., eBay, Chainalysis in crypto winter) and then execute to quickly bring them into consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:52">[03:15:52]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Experimentation:** Contrary to a perceived rigid approach, Benchmark is highly experimental. They have explored mezzanine investing, growth investing (e.g., Dropbox), and public company holdings when market conditions dictate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:45">[03:40:45]</a>.
*   **No Thesis-Driven Approach:** Benchmark is not a thesis-driven firm; instead, they are "learning machines" that follow founders and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:03">[03:39:03]</a>. They even invite CEOs of companies they missed to special dinners to understand their mistakes and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:57">[03:39:57]</a>.

[!INFO] Benchmark's 1997 Website Copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:13">[03:30:13]</a>
Their old website explicitly laid out their counter-positioning: "Many Venture firms recently raised Mega funds capitalized at more than 40 million dollars per partner. This can lead to an over extension and a lack of accessibility and responsiveness to portfolio companies. Some investors have been known to hold as many as 20 board seats at one time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:13">[03:30:13]</a> They emphasized "a high level of service with maximum investment flexibility," with $20 million per partner allowing for an average of six board seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:26">[03:31:26]</a>.

## Evolution of Investment Strategy
Benchmark's investment strategy evolved significantly:
*   **Early Era (Pre-Fab Four):** They marketed themselves as doing "seed and startup investments," meaning pre-business plan or post-business plan but not necessarily with customer traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:46">[02:10:46]</a>.
*   **Fab Four Era (Post-AWS):** They recognized a mispricing in "Series A" investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>, shifting to investing at the point of traction or product-market fit, particularly for consumer companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>. This was enabled by the rise of cloud infrastructure (AWS) and platforms like Facebook, allowing entrepreneurs to build products and demonstrate early adoption without massive upfront capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:14">[02:43:14]</a>. They continued to do seed investments in B2B, seeing repeat entrepreneurs in enterprise as "near risk-free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:10">[02:11:10]</a>.

The current partnership is well-suited for high-performing SaaS and B2B enterprise investments, with less explicit focus on consumer investments, posing an open question for the future of their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:11">[03:43:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

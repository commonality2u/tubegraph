[[Lockheed Martin]] is the United States' largest defense contractor and the federal government's largest contractor overall, receiving approximately $50 billion annually from American taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30">01:30</a>. While the company's products are primarily used as deterrents to maintain peace, they are also synonymous with "overwhelming foreign and air superiority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54">01:54</a>. The history of Lockheed, a key predecessor to Lockheed Martin, is marked by daring innovators and hardcore engineering, particularly during its "golden eras" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17">02:17</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">02:57</a>.

### Early History
The modern Lockheed Martin company is the result of approximately 17 companies merging over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43">02:43</a>. The original Lockheed company was founded in 1912 by Allen Loughead (later changed to Lockheed to avoid mispronunciation) and his brother Malcolm in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46">04:46</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07">05:07</a>. This first venture primarily operated as a tourist attraction with one plane, the Model G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30">05:30</a>. Malcolm Lockheed later moved to Detroit and invented the modern hydraulic brake system for automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41">05:41</a>.

John Northrop, who would later found [[Northrop Grumman | Northrop]], was hired by the first Lockheed company to help design future aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02">06:02</a>. He co-founded the second Lockheed company with Allen, then left to establish Avion Corporation, which was acquired by Douglas (now part of Boeing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12">06:12</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16">06:16</a>.

The second Lockheed company found success with the Vega airplane, a favorite of early aviators like Amelia Earhart and Wiley Post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42">06:42</a>. This company was eventually sold to a consortium of Detroit auto moguls forming the Detroit Aircraft Corporation (DAC), which included Charles Kettering, founder of Delco and head of research at GM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55">06:55</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06">07:06</a>. The idea was to create the "General Motors of the air," but aviation did not become a consumer industry like automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16">07:16</a>. Following the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, DAC went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46">07:46</a>. The still-profitable Lockheed division was sold out of bankruptcy in 1932 for just $40,000 to Robert Gross, marking the true founding of the modern Lockheed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51">07:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00">08:00</a>.

Under Robert Gross and his brother Cortland, Lockheed developed the iconic Electra airplane in the 1930s, famously featured in the movie *Casablanca* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36">08:36</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50">08:50</a>.

### World War II Contributions
World War II transformed Lockheed, bringing to prominence Clarence "Kelly" Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31">09:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38">09:38</a>. Johnson, an engineering prodigy known for his intuitive grasp of physics and "seeing the air," joined Lockheed in 1933 and was the principal engineer for the Electra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00">12:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51">12:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04">13:04</a>.

During the war, Lockheed adapted the Electra into the Hudson bombing vehicle, selling approximately 3,000 to Britain's Royal Air Force even before the U.S. entered the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42">13:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08">14:08</a>. Kelly Johnson also designed the P-38 Lightning fighter, the U.S.'s elite, fastest, and most maneuverable aircraft, with over 10,000 produced during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15">14:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23">14:23</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29">14:29</a>.

### [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] and the Jet Age
Towards the end of World War II, the emergence of German jet-powered fighter planes, like the Messerschmitt Me 262 "Swallow" (flying at 550 mph), presented a new threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50">15:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01">16:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42">17:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53">17:53</a>. The U.S. government tasked Kelly Johnson and Lockheed with developing a jet fighter prototype within 180 days, capable of exceeding 600 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00">18:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11">18:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20">18:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23">18:23</a>.

To achieve this, Johnson hand-picked 23 top engineers and designers and 30 shop people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53">18:53</a>. They worked in a circus tent rented in a parking lot next to a plastics factory in Burbank, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06">19:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12">19:12</a>. The persistent smell from the factory, combined with a popular comic strip called *Little Abner* featuring a moonshine still called "Skunk Works," led to the division's iconic name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18">19:18</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26">19:26</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31">19:31</a>.

Within 143 days, this elite team built the first prototype U.S. fighter jet, the Lulu Bell, which became the P-80 Shooting Star â€“ the first jet fighter in the U.S. military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01">20:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11">20:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22">21:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33">21:33</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36">21:36</a>. Key principles of [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] included rapid delivery of superior products, complete control delegated to the manager, small teams (10-25 people), co-location of designers and production, and rewarding good performance by output rather than supervision count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45">28:45</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56">29:56</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54">25:54</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48">24:48</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50">30:50</a>. These principles were essential for success in times of existential threat, such as World War II and the subsequent [[Cold Warera_aerospace_innovation_and_its_implications | Cold War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00">29:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40">29:41</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:08">32:08</a>.

### [[Cold Warera_aerospace_innovation_and_its_implications | Cold War-Era Aerospace Innovation]]

#### [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | The U-2 Spy Plane]]
The detonation of the Soviet Union's first nuclear bomb in 1949 ignited the [[Cold Warera_aerospace_innovation_and_its_implications | Cold War]] arms race, where intelligence became paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36">34:36</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41">34:41</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:27">36:27</a>. With no satellites yet, the U.S. needed a way to gather information stealthily over Soviet airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45">37:45</a>. The CIA contracted Kelly Johnson and [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] to develop the U-2 spy plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:04">39:04</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:18">41:18</a>.

The U-2 was designed to fly at 70,000 feet, far above the maximum altitude of contemporary aircraft and believed to be beyond Soviet radar capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:29">39:29</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00">40:00</a>. This required a new fuel formulation (developed by Shell Oil) and the development of spacesuits for pilots due to the extreme altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07">40:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24">40:24</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27">40:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01">41:01</a>. The camera system was developed by Dr. Edwin Land and the [[contributions_to_satellite_communications_and_defense_projects | Polaroid]] company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:31">42:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:56">42:56</a>.

Completed in just a year and a half for $3.5 million, the U-2 was tested at a dry lake bed in Nevada, famously known as [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | Area 51]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43">41:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:09">42:09</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09">45:09</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:48">46:48</a>. The first U-2 overflight of the Soviet Union occurred on July 4, 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:52">48:52</a>. Although the Soviets tracked it on radar (disproving U.S. assumptions about their radar capabilities), they could not intercept it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:11">49:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:22">49:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:51">49:51</a>. This provided critical intelligence, and the Soviets remained silent to avoid revealing their powerlessness to stop it, maintaining the U-2's secrecy for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:38">50:38</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:29">51:29</a>.

The U-2 program continued until May 1, 1960, when the Soviets finally developed a missile capable of shooting down a U-2, piloted by Francis Gary Powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07">53:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:20">53:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:22">53:22</a>. Powers' capture revealed the program, leading to a major international incident and the end of U-2 flights over Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:40">54:40</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50">55:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:01">56:01</a>.

#### Lockheed Missile Systems Division (LMSC) and Silicon Valley
The end of U-2 overflights created an intelligence gap, which was filled by a new, secret division of Lockheed, the Lockheed Missile Systems Division (LMSC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:08">56:08</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:50">58:50</a>. This division, which later became Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, would have a massive impact on the country, the world, and especially the nascent Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">01:09:00</a>.

Founded in 1954, LMSC initially copied [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]]' secret, unmarked division model in Burbank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">01:09:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">01:09:47</a>. However, missile guidance systems required expertise in radar and computing, disciplines not strong in Southern California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">01:10:28</a>. This expertise resided with Stanford Professor Frederick Terman, who, after heading the Harvard Radio Research Lab during WWII, returned to Stanford and reshaped its engineering institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">01:02:47</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">01:03:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">01:03:49</a>. Terman recruited top scientists, changed Stanford's tech transfer policies to encourage commercialization, and carved out the Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park) for commercial leases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">01:03:55</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">01:07:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">01:07:20</a>.

In 1955, Lockheed moved LMSC to the Stanford Industrial Park, becoming one of its first and largest tenants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">01:11:19</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">01:11:23</a>. They also acquired 275 acres in Sunnyvale, building a massive campus that effectively built the city, employing 20,000 people by 1959 and 30,000 by the mid-1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">01:12:05</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">01:12:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">01:12:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">01:12:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">01:12:44</a>. This made Lockheed by far the largest employer in proto-Silicon Valley, dwarfing companies like Hewlett-Packard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">01:12:47</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">01:13:05</a>. The presence of Lockheed drew talent like Jerry Wozniak, father of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, whose family moved to the region because of Lockheed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">01:15:53</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">01:16:05</a>.

##### Polaris Missile Program
LMSC took on two history-changing projects. The first was the Navy's Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) system, Polaris, awarded in 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">01:18:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">01:23:07</a>. The goal was to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles that could be launched from submarines, even underwater, to create a mobile, undetectable nuclear deterrent against a potential Soviet first strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">01:19:21</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">01:21:02</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">01:22:55</a>. By 1960, the first U.S. nuclear ballistic missile-equipped submarine, carrying Lockheed Polaris A1 missiles, set sail, capable of reaching land targets 1,200 nautical miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">01:23:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">01:23:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">01:23:33</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">01:23:41</a>. Polaris was succeeded by the Poseidon and Trident programs, with Trident missiles reaching 5,000-mile ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">01:26:02</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">01:26:07</a>.

##### [[contributions_to_satellite_communications_and_defense_projects | Corona Satellite Program]]
The second major project was a secret U.S. space program for reconnaissance satellites, run by LMSC in parallel with early NASA missions (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:48">01:30:48</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">01:30:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">01:31:20</a>. Launched under the cover story of the "Discoverer program" (life form research), the first Corona satellite went up in August 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">01:33:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">01:33:40</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">01:31:33</a>.

This satellite, equipped with a camera system, could photograph any ground location in its orbit at a resolution as low as five feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">01:33:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">01:34:00</a>. The first Corona mission alone produced more photo coverage of the Soviet Union than all previous U-2 flights combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:24">01:34:24</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">01:34:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:33">01:34:33</a>. Over the program's course, more than 800,000 images were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">01:35:00</a>.

A remarkable aspect was the film recovery method: film canisters, in custom-designed "film buckets," were dropped from orbit, re-entered the atmosphere, deployed parachutes, and were caught in mid-air by C-130 airplanes towing a claw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">01:35:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">01:36:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">01:36:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:11">01:37:11</a>. If missed, a salt plug would dissolve after two days, sinking the film to the bottom of the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">01:37:34</a>.

The Corona program, along with the Aegina rocket (which pioneered the second-stage rocket booster concept), achieved several firsts: circular orbit, polar orbit, three-axis stabilization in orbit, ground command control, and returning man-made objects from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:57">01:38:57</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">01:39:03</a>. This groundbreaking work was largely unknown to the public for over three decades due to its classified nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">01:39:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">01:39:51</a>. Subsequent programs like Gambit (better resolution), Hexagon (more coverage), and Kennen (first real-time space-based surveillance using digital photography and custom Lockheed workstations) further advanced U.S. capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:11">01:40:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">01:40:47</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">01:41:09</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">01:42:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">01:42:24</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">01:43:05</a>. LMSC also performed pioneering work in weather satellites and contributed to the development of the GPS system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">01:43:56</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:04">01:45:04</a>.

LMSC became the "Crown Jewel" of Lockheed, often generating over 100% of the company's profits during periods when other divisions, including [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]], were unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:56">01:49:56</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:02">01:50:02</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:18">01:50:18</a>. This was due to its focus on technology and computing, which yielded better margins than airplane manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:40">01:50:40</a>.

#### The SR-71 Blackbird
After the U-2 incident, [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] developed a successor plane that would be so fast it couldn't be shot down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:05">01:56:05</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:18">01:56:18</a>. This led to the A-12 Oxcart, a CIA contract, which evolved into the SR-71 Blackbird, a two-seater Air Force version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:36">01:56:36</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:55">02:04:55</a>. The SR-71 was designed to fly at Mach 3 or faster (over 2,000 mph) at altitudes of 84,000 feet, making it faster than a rifle bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">01:57:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:24">01:57:24</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:38">01:57:38</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:23">02:00:23</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:36">02:00:36</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:40">02:00:40</a>. It held records for speed and altitude for manned jet aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:38">02:00:38</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:42">02:00:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:45">02:00:45</a>.

Overcoming extreme heat generated by friction required building the entire plane out of titanium, a material never used before for aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:18">02:01:18</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:33">02:01:33</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:36">02:01:36</a>. Interestingly, much of this titanium was sourced from the Soviet Union through dummy corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:51">02:01:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">02:02:05</a>. The plane's panels were designed to fit loosely on the ground and expand snugly during flight due to heat, causing fuel to leak while stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">02:02:47</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:01">02:03:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:12">02:03:12</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:45">02:03:45</a>. A non-flammable custom fuel by Shell solved this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:55">02:03:55</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:59">02:03:59</a>.
The SR-71's Pratt & Whitney J58 engines were augmented by a "spike inlet system" â€“ retractable cones that supercharged air intake, providing three-quarters of the necessary thrust for Mach 3+ flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:23">02:05:23</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:26">02:06:26</a>. The SR-71 was purely a reconnaissance aircraft, never carrying weapons, only cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:38">02:06:38</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:40">02:06:40</a>. Its flat bottom design and flush rivets contributed to its stealth capabilities, making it difficult to detect on radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:43">02:11:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:24">02:12:24</a>. Despite being extremely expensive to build and maintain ($33 million per plane, $300 million annually for the program), it was never shot down in combat and evaded radar for four years after its first flight in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:03">02:09:03</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">02:09:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:54">02:13:54</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:06">02:14:06</a>.

#### The F-117 Nighthawk (Stealth Fighter)
In the mid-1970s, a [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] mathematician, Dennis Overholser, applied equations from a Russian paper to design a stealth aircraft that would be two orders of magnitude better than previous attempts, reducing its radar signature to that of a ball bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">02:21:17</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:32">02:21:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:50">02:21:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">02:22:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:16">02:22:16</a>. Despite Kelly Johnson's skepticism about its aerodynamics and aesthetics, Ben Rich, Kelly's successor, pursued the project, building a prototype called "Have Blue" (nicknamed "Hopeless Diamond") without an initial government contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:04">02:23:04</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:13">02:23:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:33">02:23:33</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:42">02:23:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:16">02:26:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">02:27:06</a>.

The F-117A Nighthawk, with its faceted, non-aerodynamic shape, relied on "fly-by-wire" computer systems to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:21">02:24:21</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:51">02:24:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">02:29:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:06">02:30:06</a>. Lockheed won the contract, delivering 59 Nighthawks at $43 million each, providing much-needed revenue in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:50">02:29:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:09">02:30:09</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:13">02:30:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:15">02:30:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:18">02:30:18</a>. The Nighthawk's combat debut in Operation Desert Storm was a massive success, with the F-117s knocking out Baghdad's defenses on the first night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:25">02:30:25</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">02:30:28</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:30">02:31:30</a>. Despite flying only 1% of air missions, they accounted for 40% of all damaged targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:01">02:33:01</a>. The F-117 remained classified for 21 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:55">02:33:55</a>.

### Post-Cold War Consolidation and Modern Era
The end of the [[Cold Warera_aerospace_innovation_and_its_implications | Cold War]] in the early 1990s led to massive defense budget cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:15">02:34:15</a>. In 1993, Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry convened the "Last Supper" meeting, instructing major defense contractors to consolidate to maintain America's industrial base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:37">02:35:37</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:02">02:36:02</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:05">02:36:05</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:47">02:36:47</a>. This led to a wave of mergers, including Lockheed's acquisition of General Dynamics' fighter jet business (including the F-16) in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:52">02:38:52</a>.

In 1995, Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in a "merger of equals," forming Lockheed Martin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">02:39:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">04:37</a>. This new entity also acquired Loral's defense business and attempted to merge with Northrop Grumman in 1997, but the U.S. Department of Justice blocked it to preserve competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:23">02:40:23</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:31">02:40:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:33">02:40:33</a>. The industry consolidated into five major "primes": Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:52">02:40:52</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:59">02:40:59</a>.

#### F-22 Raptor
The F-22 Raptor program, initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 and F-16, demonstrates the challenges of modern defense contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:11">02:48:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:15">02:48:15</a>. An initial commitment for 750 planes at $44 billion ballooned to $62 billion for only 187 planes delivered, costing approximately $360 million per aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:29">02:48:29</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:06">02:49:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">02:49:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:26">02:49:26</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:30">02:49:30</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:34">02:49:34</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:39">02:49:39</a>. The F-22 incorporated advanced stealth lessons from the F-117, allowing for 3D rounded surfaces thanks to advances in computing power; Sega even co-developed arcade boards with Lockheed Martin to model these complex shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:15">02:50:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">02:50:47</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:08">02:51:08</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:29">02:51:29</a>. The F-22 was built in 46 states, employing 95,000 people, a common practice to secure congressional support for funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:01">02:53:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:05">02:53:05</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:21">02:53:21</a>.

#### F-35 Lightning II
The F-35 Lightning II, or Joint Strike Fighter, aims to be a common platform for the U.S. armed services and allies, with three models for different purposes, including one capable of vertical takeoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:30">02:54:30</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:47">02:54:47</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:01">02:55:01</a>. Its focus is on information-based warfare, with advanced communication and heads-up displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:38">02:55:38</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:58">02:55:58</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:03">02:56:03</a>. The initial order book was for approximately 3,000 F-35s, worth a potential $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:17">02:56:17</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:21">02:56:21</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:26">02:56:26</a>. The U.S. order alone is for 398 planes at $30 billion ($75 million per plane, or $750 million per plane when amortizing all R&D costs), with international orders from countries like Switzerland, Finland, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">02:57:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:11">02:57:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:20">02:57:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:23">02:57:23</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:25">02:57:25</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:27">02:57:27</a>.

### Lockheed Martin Today
Lockheed Martin's business is segmented into Aeronautics (F-35, F-22, F-16, C-130J), Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems (including Sikorsky helicopters), and Space (Orion Capsule, ULA joint venture with Boeing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:44">03:09:44</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:20">03:10:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:22">03:10:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:25">03:10:25</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:28">03:10:28</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:31">03:10:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:34">03:10:34</a>. The F-35 is its largest program, generating 20% of all net sales across all segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:01">03:10:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:03">03:10:03</a>.

In 2022, Lockheed Martin's total revenue was $66 billion, with $50 billion (75%) coming from the U.S. federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:23">03:01:23</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:27">03:01:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:30">03:01:30</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:33">03:01:33</a>. The company operates on a Cost Plus pricing model, resulting in an 8% net income margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:51">03:01:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">03:02:02</a>. This model ensures the company doesn't take significant financial risk but also limits its operating leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:56">03:03:56</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:01">03:04:01</a>.

The U.S. defense budget of $800 billion, while a significant portion of federal spending, is less than social security, healthcare, and income security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:33">02:58:33</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:06">03:00:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">03:00:10</a>. About half of this budget is spent on contractors, with Lockheed Martin being the single largest recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:33">03:00:33</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:42">03:00:42</a>.

The dynamic between the defense industry and the government has evolved into a "military industrial Congressional complex," where companies like Lockheed Martin are often seen as "too big to fail" due to their critical role in maintaining national capabilities and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:16">03:21:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:20">03:21:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:22">03:21:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:24">03:21:24</a>. This contrasts with the rapid iteration and risk-taking ethos of [[innovation_in_defense_and_government_sectors | Silicon Valley]] that Lockheed helped to seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:15">03:04:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:21">03:04:21</a>.

Bill McDermott is a prominent figure in the enterprise software industry, currently serving as the CEO of ServiceNow. His career trajectory showcases a deep understanding of sales, leadership, and brand building, stemming from humble beginnings and a "scrappy" entrepreneurial spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Early Life and Entrepreneurship

McDermott's professional life began at a very young age as a teenage entrepreneur, operating a delicatessen that helped him finance his high school and college education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This experience, along with other early jobs like delivering newspapers, pumping gas, busing tables, and working for the town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, instilled in him humility and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. At the deli, he honed his interpersonal skills by interacting with up to 500 people daily, learning to understand their desires and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This direct interaction laid the groundwork for his future in sales, teaching him to "read the room" and be "real with people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Entry into Corporate America: Xerox

Driven by a dream to work for a premier corporation with a strong training program in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, McDermott initiated his corporate career by sending out direct mail campaigns. Xerox was one of the companies that invited him for an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Despite not coming from an Ivy League or corporate pedigree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, he secured a sales job at Xerox, a company considered a leading technology firm comparable to Google or Amazon today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Xerox's Culture and Products
Xerox in the 1980s was undergoing a reinvention focused on Total Quality Management, benchmarked against Japanese principles like those from Toyota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This formal, process-driven approach to building products, selling, and post-sale care deeply influenced McDermott <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He found inspiration in CEO David Kearns' vision for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Xerox's product offerings at the time included photocopiers, electronic typewriters, faxes, and early laser printers, alongside advanced "document" systems that resembled modern computers with intuitive user interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

### Sales Training and Success
McDermott graduated number one in Xerox's highly competitive sales training program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, which was built on the "SPIN" (Situation, Problem, Implication, Needs Payoff) methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This achievement earned him a coveted sales territory in Manhattan, spanning from 57th to 59th Street, and Fifth Avenue to Park Avenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Sales Approach
> McDermott's strategy involved:
> *   Treating his territory as his "patch," knowing every doorman and detail about the buildings and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
> *   Emphasizing that sales is a "numbers game" and committing to outworking competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
> *   Prioritizing freedom over bureaucracy, advocating for sales professionals to be "on the loose" with minimal internal meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

## Transition to Sales Management and Leadership Philosophy

McDermott quickly ascended the sales ranks at Xerox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. He realized his passion lay in helping others succeed, often traveling with colleagues to offer pointers and take over calls when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This led him to his first sales management job in his mid-20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, overseeing 17 salespeople covering Manhattan and the Bronx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. He secured this role by presenting a detailed 100-day action plan and demonstrating an unparalleled desire for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

### Team Leadership at Xerox
McDermott cultivated a strong, family-like culture within his sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. His philosophy included:
*   **Goal Orientation:** Posting each team member's top three business and personal goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   **Discretionary Effort:** Encouraging team members to contribute 20% of their effort to help the team, recognizing that "nobody gets to fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   **Personal Connection:** Fostering deep relationships through team outings and understanding personal interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
*   **Empowerment:** Encouraging action over seeking permission, with the motto: "easier to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. He emphasized "roughly right executed right now" over perfect two weeks from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

## Leadership at SAP and ServiceNow

After his tenure at Xerox, McDermott served as the CEO of SAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Currently, he is the CEO of ServiceNow, a role he has held for the past five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Under his leadership, ServiceNow's revenue has grown from $3.5 billion to over $10 billion, and its market capitalization is now nearly $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Enterprise Sales Philosophy
McDermott's approach to enterprise sales at ServiceNow is centered on understanding the customer's needs and strategy rather than just selling technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. He believes founders should focus on "the job that they would likely hire your product for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>, rather than their own pride in their tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Common Sales Pitfalls
> McDermott advises against:
> *   Going into meetings without a "prescriptive notion of what might be possible" for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
> *   Using off-the-shelf sales pitches without understanding the customer's specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.
> *   Jumping straight into PowerPoints; instead, take a few minutes to build rapport and "read the room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

ServiceNow positions itself as an "AI platform for business transformation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>, automating work across traditional functional silos (Finance, HR, Sales, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. McDermott views ServiceNow as a way to "make all those silos better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a> by integrating existing systems of record (like ERP, CRM, HRIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a> and providing a "control tower" for workflows and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. The hardest part of selling ServiceNow is often reaching the CEO, who has the broad vision to see the company's value across the entire enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.

### Brand Building
Unusually for an enterprise software company, McDermott places significant emphasis on brand building, viewing it as the company's "identity" and "DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. ServiceNow's tagline, "the world works with ServiceNow," reflects this ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. The company has invested in brand ambassadors like Idris Elba, who not only feature in commercials but also align with the company's philanthropic goals, such as the [[idris_elbas_work_with_service_now_on_sherbro_island | Sherbro Island project]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. McDermott's dream is for ServiceNow to become a top 10 global brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

### Partnerships
ServiceNow actively cultivates partnerships, distinguishing itself from companies that view competitors in a "zero-sum game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. McDermott believes that closely knitted tech companies mutually benefit the customer, leading to more reinvestment in technology and lifting "all boats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. He emphasizes that partners must be well-trained, committed to the brand, and share common values and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Impact

McDermott's career is underpinned by core principles, including the importance of keeping promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>, putting people first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>, and celebrating the "joy of work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. He advocates for fostering cultures where people want to be together, learn, grow, and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>. He believes that strong interpersonal connections are crucial for success, contrasting this with the isolation that can come from being overly focused on digital devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. His approach resonates with other prominent leaders like [[history_of_starbucks_and_howard_schultzs_journey | Howard Schultz]], whom he considers a "brother from a different mother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a> due to their similar backgrounds and shared belief in people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

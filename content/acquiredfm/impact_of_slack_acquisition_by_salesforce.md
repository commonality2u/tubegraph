Salesforce acquired Slack for $27.7 billion in December 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The deal, valued at approximately $45.86 per share in cash and stock, represented a 55% premium to Slack's trading price before news of the leak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. It marked the largest software deal since IBM's acquisition of Red Hat in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Slack is expected to remain independent, with Stewart Butterfield continuing as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Slack's Pre-Acquisition Performance and Challenges

Before the acquisition, Slack had a tumultuous public market journey since its direct listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Despite reporting strong financial numbers, including being the fifth fastest-growing company with the second-best net dollar retention among cloud companies, its stock often suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Slack was considered a top-quartile SaaS company across many metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### The [[slacks_challenges_and_competition_with_microsoft_teams | Microsoft Teams]] Narrative

The primary factor driving down Slack's valuation was the perceived threat from [[slacks_challenges_and_competition_with_microsoft_teams | Microsoft Teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Microsoft aggressively positioned Teams against Slack, explicitly naming Slack in its reports and charts to highlight Teams' user growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This strategy, rare in the industry, aimed to protect Microsoft's core Office suite by threatening email with a Slack-like platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Microsoft Teams reportedly had around 100 million users compared to Slack's 12 million, but this comparison was often seen as misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Teams was largely seen as a [[future_of_collaboration_tools_in_enterprise | Zoom]] competitor, bundled with Office 365, and not primarily a direct rival to Slack's core functionality for large-scale organizational chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Unlike Zoom, Slack was seen as a platform that could threaten Microsoft's cash cow by integrating with various best-in-class software, potentially replacing email and becoming a central hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

## Strategic Rationale for Salesforce

### Distribution and Enterprise Reach
Salesforce's acquisition of Slack is primarily a distribution deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. Slack's historical growth came from small, innovative organizations and startups, expanding as those companies grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. However, Slack lacked a credible way to acquire large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. Salesforce provides a massive professional sales force to push Slack into organizations where it previously struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### Slack Connect and Customer 360
A key piece of the strategic fit is Slack Connect, which enables communication between different companies, partners, or clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. This functionality grew significantly, with Slack reporting an increase from 380,000 to 520,000 Slack Connect endpoints in the quarter preceding the acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Salesforce envisions Slack Connect as a way to integrate communication directly into the Customer 360 platform, humanizing the sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. The stated vision is to create an "operating system for the new way to work" by making Slack the new interface for Salesforce Customer 360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

### The "Anti-Microsoft" Alliance
The acquisition represents an attempt to consolidate "best-of-breed" applications against Microsoft's integrated suite strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. While Microsoft offers a fully integrated system that is "best at nothing but best integrated," Salesforce is building an ecosystem of purpose-built, best-in-class software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. This could alleviate "subscription fatigue" and procurement pain for enterprises dealing with many disparate SaaS services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

## Slack's Decision to Sell

Despite being a rapidly growing company (39% year-over-year revenue growth in its last reported quarter) and flipping to cash flow positive territory, Slack chose to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. The 55% premium offered was a significant factor, especially after prolonged stock price stagnation below its direct public offering (DPO) price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. The constant battle with [[slacks_challenges_and_competition_with_microsoft_teams | Microsoft Teams]] and the associated "annoyance and pain" of dealing with Microsoft's distribution advantage may have contributed to a "fatigue" on Slack's part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. The deal allows Stewart Butterfield, a product-focused CEO, to continue focusing on product vision while leveraging Salesforce's sales expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>.

## Potential Future Scenarios

### F Scenario (Failure)
A significant risk is that the strategic decision to build an "anti-Microsoft" alliance with best-of-breed applications might not resonate with large enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>. If startups and high-growth companies perceive Slack as compromised by Salesforce's acquisition ("ew Slack is part of Salesforce") and migrate to next-generation tools like Discord, it could undermine Slack's core user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>. The integration might fail, turning Slack into another atrophied Salesforce acquisition like Quip or Heroku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.

### A+ Scenario (Success)
In an A+ scenario, Salesforce successfully integrates Slack, dramatically increasing its revenue growth through its extensive distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:53">[01:23:53]</a>. Slack becomes a trustworthy vendor for larger companies, gaining adoption in 30,000-50,000 seat organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:20">[01:24:20]</a>. The acquisition catalyzes the "anti-Microsoft" alliance, establishing Salesforce as a successful distribution channel for other best-of-breed SaaS companies, opening new markets for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

## Alternative Acquirers

Other potential acquirers for Slack included:

*   **Google:** A Google-Slack acquisition made significant strategic sense, combining Slack with G Suite (Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets) to create a powerful new office bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. Google's vast cash reserves would have easily facilitated a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.
*   **[[future_of_collaboration_tools_in_enterprise | Zoom]]:** With a market cap of around $130 billion, [[future_of_collaboration_tools_in_enterprise | Zoom]] could have used its highly valued stock as currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. However, [[future_of_collaboration_tools_in_enterprise | Zoom]] historically had an underdeveloped corporate development function, and its focus remained on its core video platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>.

## Slack's Public Company Tenure Grade

Slack's tenure as a public company received a "C minus" grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>. While the final acquisition price was above its direct public offering (DPO) price, the stock largely traded flat or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. The company failed to effectively counter the narrative that [[slacks_challenges_and_competition_with_microsoft_teams | Microsoft Teams]] was destroying it, despite strong underlying business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>. This was seen as a failing in communication rather than product execution, as Slack continued to build out its ecosystem and underlying features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:28">[01:19:28]</a>.

A key principle in achieving profitability is flexibility, as rigidity can be a significant obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept was pivotal in the development of [[introduction_to_junk_bonds | high yield bond investing]].

## Early Landscape and Open-Mindedness

When high yield bonds first emerged, the market was largely considered a "backwater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Most investment organizations adhered to strict rules, prohibiting the purchase of bonds rated below A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Investing in single B bonds was seen as unconventional and met with resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, this lack of competition was a distinct advantage, akin to being the sole bidder at an auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This highlights the importance of open-mindedness and the continuous evolution of one's thinking in investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Historical Perspective and the "Aha" Moment

The [[history_and_evolution_of_high_yield_bonds | origins of high yield investing]] can be traced back to figures like Mike Milken, who became interested in low-rated bonds around 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Milken reportedly discovered a book by Hickman, which analyzed bond performance from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This research revealed a counterintuitive truth: the lower a bond's rating, the higher its *actual* rate of return (realized total return), even factoring in defaults and bankruptcies, which occurred during periods like the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The excess yield offered by these bonds was more than sufficient to offset credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This discovery was a significant "aha moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

At that time, issuing a low-rated bond was almost impossible; they were labeled "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Rating agencies like Moody's explicitly defined a B-rated bond as failing "to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This created an environment where such bonds were dismissed regardless of price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Understanding and Mitigating Risk

A common misconception about high yield bonds, often referred to as [[risks_and_rewards_of_junk_bond_investing | junk bonds]], is that their inevitable defaults make them unsuitable for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This can be countered by drawing an analogy to life insurance companies:

*   **Awareness of Risk:** Just as life insurance companies know every policyholder will eventually die, investors in high yield bonds are aware that some will default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. It's an anticipated risk, not a shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Analyzable Risk:** Life insurers analyze health risks to price policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Similarly, investors can analyze the credit risk of high yield bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Diversifiable Risk:** Insurance companies diversify their policies across a wide range of individuals to avoid concentration in high-risk groups (e.g., skydivers or smokers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. High yield bond portfolios can similarly be diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Compensation for Risk:** The most crucial element is that life insurance companies are well-compensated for the risks they take, pricing policies to ensure profitability even with known mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This principle applies directly to high yield bonds, where the higher yields act as an "emerging margin of safety," compensating for potential defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Contrasting Investment Philosophies: High Yield Bonds vs. "Nifty Fifty"

The speaker's personal experience at Citibank, starting in 1969, involved being part of a firm that focused on the "Nifty Fifty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. These were considered the best and fastest-growing companies in America, believed to be immune to negative events, and for which "no price was too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

This philosophy was the polar opposite of high yield bonds, where the perception was that "no price was low enough" to make them an appropriate investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Both stances proved to be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### The Failure of the "Nifty Fifty"

Despite being the "best companies in America," an investment in the Nifty Fifty in 1969, held for five years, would have resulted in significant losses (over 90%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The primary reason was their excessive pricing; while the post-war S&P 500 average P/E ratio was 16, many Nifty Fifty stocks sold at 60 to 90 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

This demonstrates that even high-quality companies can be poor investments if their prices are too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Furthermore, some of the perceived invulnerability was illusory:
*   **IBM:** Once considered unassailable ("you can't be fired for buying IBM"), it faced significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Xerox:** Lost its market to imports and required a new business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Patterns:** A consumer company once part of the Nifty Fifty, reflecting a declining market for sewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The concept of disruption was largely unconsidered, and perceived "moats" were thought to be inviolable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This led to a failure to anticipate how pricing decisions (e.g., Xerox's 30-cent copies) could create a price umbrella for foreign competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. In contrast, by applying the aforementioned principles to the "worst public companies in America" (high yield bonds), steady and safe profits were generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

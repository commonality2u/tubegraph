Evaluating judgment and decision-making is crucial, not only for personal investment strategies but also when assessing potential hires, particularly in fields like venture capital and investment management. The process involves looking beyond conventional metrics and understanding the innate qualities that drive superior performance [07:11:00].

## Aligning Strategy with Strengths and Demeanor

A fundamental principle in investing is that one's investment strategy must suit their demeanor as an investor [00:03:00]. This idea extends to career advice: find something that plays to your strengths, avoids weaknesses, and brings enjoyment [00:37:00]. Doing what is natural leads to competitive advantage and durability [00:23:00]. Choosing a path that is not enjoyable, merely for more money, can be a "world-class mistake" [01:05:00].

While it's important to find what suits you, one must also avoid getting too comfortable or ignoring opportunities outside their "comfort zone" [01:26:00]. For instance, a critique of Warren Buffett is his initial disregard for technology, which later became pervasive [01:40:00].

## The Conundrum of Investing and Judgment

Investing presents a "dichotomy" or "conundrum" where one must [[importance_of_aligning_investment_strategy_with_personal_strengths | stick to their last]] and do what they are good at [02:45:00], yet also be [[balancing_confidence_and_openmindedness_in_investment_decisions | open-minded and willing to change]] [02:51:00]. To be a good investor, one needs confidence to back uncertain ventures and stay with them, even buying more when they decline [03:00:00]. However, this confidence must not devolve into pig-headedness, throwing "bad money after good" [03:16:00]. Similarly, concentration of holdings is necessary for good ideas to make a difference, but diversification is needed to protect against unforeseen circumstances [03:21:00].

These complex considerations highlight why investing is a fascinating field where decision-making [[machines_analyzing_data_for_decisionmaking | cannot be reduced to an algorithm]] [03:43:00]. Human judgment, especially in making better [[longterm_qualitative_judgments_in_venture_capital | qualitative judgments about the future]], offers a competitive advantage that computers are unlikely to replicate soon [03:51:00]. A computer cannot predict which business plan will become Amazon or which CEO will be the next Steve Jobs [04:20:00].

### The Nature of Judgment

As Charlie Munger noted, none of this is meant to be easy; those who think it is are "stupid" [05:21:00]. The things one is "supposed to do" are simple to describe but difficult to execute consistently and over time [05:41:00]. It all comes down to judgment [05:53:00].

Judgment stems from "second level thinking" – thinking at a higher, different, and more correct level than others [06:01:00]. It encompasses perception, knowledge, advantage, insight, and context [06:22:00]. While it's an intangible quality, its components include:
*   Deep knowledge and understanding of relevant frameworks [06:51:00].
*   Rationality – the ability to think logically rather than emotionally [06:59:00].
*   Self-awareness to identify personal biases that might infect decision-making [07:07:00].
*   Intellectual humility – knowing that one can be wrong and understanding what one doesn't know [07:16:00].

## Evaluating Others' Judgment in Hiring

When recruiting, particularly for [[hiring_and_team_building_for_startups | hiring and team building for startups]], the goal is to assess other people's judgment [07:40:00].

### Qualities to Seek in Hires
*   **Intelligence**: Look for "smart people" and what Howard Marks's wife calls "Smart Eyes" – exceptional individuals who intuitively grasp things and understand what's important [08:04:00].
*   **Beyond Quantitative**: Seek those who can go beyond readily available quantitative information and understand underlying dynamics [08:18:00]. For instance, recognizing that "the cure for low oil prices is low oil prices" [08:26:00].
*   **Team Players**: Crucially, seek individuals who can work and exchange ideas collaboratively with peers, managers, and subordinates [08:37:00]. The aim is to avoid "Lone Wolf" or "you eat what you kill" types, favoring those who contribute to a collective [08:51:00].

### Assessing Founders and Venture Investment Decisions

In venture capital, the "vast, vast majority of the investment consideration is backing the right people" [09:27:00]. Therefore, evaluating founders is a daily and weekly task [09:34:00].

To "suss out" judgment in a venture pitch, it's essential to move beyond a typical resume recitation [09:47:00]. Instead, focus on:
*   **Personal Story and Background**: Dive deeply into why they made past decisions [10:05:00].
*   **Learning and Evolution**: Determine if they have learned and evolved from their experiences [10:39:00].
*   **First Principles Thinking**: Look for decisions based on fundamental truths, not just conventional wisdom [10:43:00].
*   **Going Against the Herd**: Assess their willingness to diverge from the consensus [10:45:00].
*   **Passion and Specific Knowledge**: Ascertain if their ideas stem from passion and a deep understanding of a real problem [10:48:00].

These insights into past actions and motivations are difficult to fake, unlike rehearsed answers for prospective scenarios [10:31:00]. In hiring, this translates to thoroughly understanding what people have done and why [11:01:00], alongside testing for specific skills [11:07:00].

### The "Weirdo" Factor and Unconventional Thinking

For startups, a key characteristic of successful founders is being a "weirdo" – specifically, someone who is "four standard deviations from the mean" at something, even if it's unconventional [11:36:00]. Startups, by nature, lack a clear roadmap and require individuals to think for themselves, challenging conventional processes [12:10:00]. Success comes from being "unconventional," willing to do things based on personal conviction and what is right for them, rather than simply being the best at what's conventional [12:29:00].

As Howard Marks suggests, the "path to exceptionality cannot come through doing what everybody else does" [12:52:00]. In challenging fields without simple algorithms, the person who "sees differently and better is the one who is going to win" [13:17:00]. As David Swenson of Yale's endowment emphasized, one must be "uncomfortably idiosyncratic" to achieve superior results, even if it means being out of step with "common sense" [13:28:00].

Even with a perfect idea, like Google's PageRank algorithm, a mediocre or conventionally talented person would likely fail to build a successful company [13:53:00]. This is because building a company is immensely difficult, and success attracts intense competition [14:18:00]. Therefore, it takes "exceptional people who can exhibit exceptional judgment" and attract other exceptional individuals to build truly great ventures [14:37:00].

From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The success of the [[amazoncoms_early_business_strategy_and_growth | Amazon.com]] episode was significant, becoming the biggest episode ever for the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article details the evolution of Amazon Web Services (AWS), a company that, despite generating only about 15% of [[amazoncoms_early_business_strategy_and_growth | Amazon's]] massive retail revenue, produces the same, if not more, operating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. AWS is described as one of the biggest and most important businesses, technologies, and products in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Setting the Stage: Post-Dot-Com Bubble (2001-2002)

The story of AWS begins around the end of 2001 and early 2002, in the immediate aftermath of the dot-com bubble burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. At this time, Jeff Bezos was an embattled CEO, with Amazon fighting for its life against both eBay and Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The board even considered bringing in "adult supervision" for Bezos, though this did not pan out as Bezos later valiantly regained full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## The Origin Stories of AWS

There are not one, not two, not three, but four separate origin stories for AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Each offers important insights into what AWS is, Amazon culture, and Amazon itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Myth #1: The Excess Capacity Narrative

The most widely believed, yet untrue, origin story is the "excess capacity narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This story suggests that [[amazoncoms_early_business_strategy_and_growth | Amazon.com]], being a highly seasonal retail business with huge traffic spikes in Q4, had excess technical infrastructure capacity during Q1-Q3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. The legend states they decided to rent out this unused capacity to other developers to turn an expense into revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

However, this myth is debunked for two main reasons:
1.  **Technical Infeasibility**: Pre-cloud technology companies did not operate this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Servers were highly customized and tightly coupled to specific applications. There was no easy way to rent out infrastructure, especially not with adequate security and multi-tenancy support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. The [[amazoncoms_early_business_strategy_and_growth | Amazon.com]] codebase ran on proprietary DEC Alpha servers, not on easily rent-able, virtualized cloud servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The shift to [[importance_of_linux_and_open_source_for_aws_development | Linux]] and open-source software later enabled more flexible infrastructure, but this was a separate, cost-saving initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
2.  **Logical Fallacy**: If AWS customers relied on excess capacity, they wouldn't have access during Amazon's peak Q4, which would be an untenable business model for mission-critical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

Werner Vogels, then AWS CTO and now CTO of all of Amazon, explicitly stated in a 2011 Quora post: "The excess capacity story is a myth. It was never a matter of selling excess capacity... Amazon Web Services was always considered a business by itself, with the expectation that it could even grow as big as the amazon.com retail operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. This narrative underestimates Amazon's intentionality and [[amazon_and_aws_business_strategy_intentions | business strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. [[amazons_use_of_technology_as_an_investment | Technology was never a cost center for Amazon]]; it was always viewed as an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

### Origin Story #2: Web 2.0 and APIs (Tim O'Reilly's Influence)

This story focuses on the vision for AWS being inspired by Tim O'Reilly, known for O'Reilly programming books and championing Web 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Web 2.0 emphasized dynamic websites, "participatory culture," and "interoperability" through APIs, allowing developers to build "mashups" using services like Google Maps or Flickr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. This vision was about democratizing what companies had built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

In early 2002, Tim O'Reilly met with Jeff Bezos in Seattle to pitch the idea of transforming [[amazoncoms_early_business_strategy_and_growth | Amazon.com]] into a participatory Web 2.0 website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Bezos "totally gets it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. The idea was to allow businesses to interact programmatically via APIs, enabling thousands of companies to do business without direct business development agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. For Amazon, this had an obvious use case: its giant Amazon Associates affiliate program could use APIs to access its authoritative product catalog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.

After this meeting, Bezos embraced the idea, inviting O'Reilly to evangelize Web 2.0 and APIs within Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. A new team was formed within Amazon to build these APIs, with a stated goal to "let them surprise us with what they build" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. In 2002, Amazon announced the launch of this new division, called **Amazon Web Services**, at a developer conference attended by eight people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. Initially, AWS was focused on exposing the [[amazoncoms_early_business_strategy_and_growth | Amazon.com]] product catalog via APIs for affiliates, residing within the Amazon Associates program, led by Colin Bryar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. This initial AWS was **not** cloud-based IT infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Origin Story #3: The Internal Monolithic Software Problem and SOA

Around the same time (mid-2003), Amazon faced its biggest internal problem: the [[amazoncoms_early_business_strategy_and_growth | Amazon.com]] codebase, designed in 1995 for small, non-scalable teams, had become a single monolithic software base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. This led to "code freezes" in Q4 to prevent system failures, slowing down innovation and new feature launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. Adding new features or teams could "break everything," making software development incredibly slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

Jeff Bezos, and his new technical assistant (shadow) **Andy Jassy**, focused on this critical internal issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. Instead of increasing communication and coordination (as many companies like Microsoft did with program management roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>), Bezos made a radical leap: **less communication, no communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

Inspired by the Web 2.0 API concept, Bezos mandated that all internal teams must expose their data and functionality through "hardened interfaces" (APIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. Communication between teams was *only* allowed through these interfaces; no direct linking, data store reads, shared memory, or backdoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. All service interfaces had to be designed to be externalizable, meaning they could be exposed to outside developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. The famous anecdote is point six of the mandate: "Anyone who doesn't do this will be fired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. This approach, known as **service-oriented architecture (SOA)**, meant every small team and feature was its own separate application, interacting via APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.

This radical shift aimed to allow engineers to focus on "what makes your beer taste better" (customer experience and new features), by standardizing and abstracting away the underlying infrastructure complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>. It also aligned with Amazon's culture of documentation, as APIs require strict, documented requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.

The internal shift to SOA made it impossible to centrally plan IT infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. Thus, Amazon realized they needed to do the same with IT: transform it into an API-accessible pool of computing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. This internal need for dynamic, scalable hardware provisioned via APIs was a key step towards **cloud IT infrastructure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

In mid-2003, Jeff Bezos appointed Andy Jassy to lead a new initiative. Jassy proposed externalizing this API-based IT infrastructure to third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. He famously wrote a six-page document (tinkering with margins to fit) and white-boarded financial projections, proposing to hire 57 new people to pursue this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. This vision was approved by Bezos and the S-team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. Jassy took over AWS from Colin Bryar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>, recruiting key talent like Adam Selipsky (current AWS CEO) and Jeff Lawson (Twilio CEO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>.

### Origin Story #4: The Dissenting Network Engineering Narrative

Concurrently and separately from Jassy's efforts, a network engineer named Benjamin Black and his boss, Chris Pinkham (who oversaw network engineering under CIO Rick Dalzell), were working on the internal IT architecture transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. In their own six-pager, they supposedly mentioned that their new architecture could be used to sell virtual compute servers as a service to third-party developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

Pinkham, wanting to move back to South Africa, was convinced by Rick Dalzell to stay with Amazon and lead a new subsidiary in Cape Town, South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>. There, with engineer Chris Brown, they began working independently on the compute server idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. This team in South Africa built **EC2** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. Brad Stone's "The Everything Store" quotes Pinkham saying EC2 was "born in isolation" and that he "spent most of [his] time trying to hide from Bezos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>. This suggests tension and a less centrally planned origin for EC2 than the official narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

Andy Jassy, in a one-star review of the book, asserted that his vision document for AWS (including EC2) was finished in September 2003, a year before Pinkham moved to South Africa, acknowledging Pinkham's "integral role" but emphasizing his own leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>. This highlights that success often has many "fathers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>, and Amazon's decentralized innovation culture allowed for concurrent development efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

## Launch of AWS Services

Despite Jassy's ambition to launch with a full suite of services (storage, compute, databases, CDN) to build a "whole operating system" over the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>, AWS launched services individually:
*   **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Launched in March 2006, it was the first service and independently useful for storing data, images, or anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. It offered a "pay-as-you-go" and "insanely cheap" model, eliminating the need to buy, configure, or maintain servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.
*   **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Launched a few months later in August 2006 (in beta), it was the compute counterpart to S3, allowing developers to spin up virtual computers in the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>.
*   **CloudFront (CDN)**: The content delivery network launched in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>.
*   **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: The first major database offering launched in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>, allowing users to run existing database software like PostgreSQL in the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

The pricing model was radically disruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>. James Hamilton, then an engineer at Microsoft, recounted his astonishment at receiving a bill for $3.08 for development and testing of an application on S3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>. This "pay-with-a-credit-card" model was unheard of for enterprise IT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>.

This model made it incredibly easy and cheap for **startups** to get started, birthing companies like Dropbox, Instagram, Airbnb, Uber, and Zynga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>. Amazon actively embraced this, starting the AWS Startup Challenge in 2007, where Justin.tv (which later pivoted to Twitch and was acquired by Amazon) was a contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>. AWS developers actively engaged with the startup community, making it the obvious default platform to build on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

## AWS's Market Dominance and Competitor Analysis

A major turning point was **Netflix** becoming an AWS customer in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>. Despite competing with [[amazoncoms_early_business_strategy_and_growth | Amazon.com]] in streaming, Netflix chose AWS for its infrastructure, with CEO Reed Hastings publicly stating it was "legitimately the smart infrastructure decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. This endorsement helped overcome fears among retailers and other companies that Amazon would compete with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>.

### Why Competitors Failed

*   **Old Server Companies (IBM, Oracle, HP)**: These companies relied on highly bundled, proprietary hardware/software solutions with 70-80% gross margins, sold via expensive licenses and audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>. AWS's 20-40% gross margins were unattractive to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>. They weren't willing to disrupt their lucrative annuity business model for the "always up-to-date" cloud model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>. AWS's Redshift database service name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to "shift away from big red" (Oracle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**: Microsoft should have capitalized on this market due to its existing IT relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:11]</a>. However, the powerful Windows Server group resisted anything that could cannibalize its license sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>. When Microsoft launched Azure Cloud Services, it initially adopted a Platform as a Service (PaaS) approach (like Google App Engine), focusing on building new applications rather than offering primitives for "lift and shift" from on-premise infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. This meant they missed both the startups (who wanted IaaS) and enterprises (who wanted lift and shift) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:45">[01:30:45]</a>. Satya Nadella later shifted Microsoft's strategy to embrace IaaS with Azure, leading to its current strong competitive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>.
*   **Google**: Google's accidental business success in search resulted in high gross margins and a lack of enterprise sales competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>. A 30% gross margin cloud business was less attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a>. Like Microsoft, Google also started with a PaaS approach (Google App Engine), which was too early for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>. Despite having superior technology and expertise in data centers and machine learning, they lacked the sales and marketing muscle and the "iron gut" for the "grind it out and hard" cloud business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:01">[01:43:01]</a>.

AWS's initial focus on startups allowed them to grow without needing enterprise sales capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>. However, they later built this "enterprise muscle" by working with academia and institutions like NASA, who became a customer in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>.

### Database Business and Lock-in

AWS has become a huge database business, with databases being three of its top five most used services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>. The global database software market is $100 billion and growing at 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:37">[01:47:37]</a>. Database software is incredibly sticky, especially at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:58">[01:47:58]</a>. The massive increase in data storage (which outpaces internet bandwidth growth) makes data migration extremely challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>. Amazon even developed "Snowball" (100TB secure storage devices) and "Snowmobile" (a semi-truck full of Snowballs) to physically transport petabytes or exabytes of customer data to their data centers, as it would take years to upload over the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:19">[01:49:19]</a>.

Notably, [[amazoncoms_early_business_strategy_and_growth | Amazon.com]] itself, which used Oracle databases from its inception, did not complete its migration off Oracle onto AWS products until 2019, 13 years after AWS launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:03">[01:51:03]</a>. This demonstrates the significant lock-in and switching costs in the database market.

### Financial Performance and "Market Size Unconstrained"

AWS is on an $80 billion revenue run rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:17">[01:52:17]</a>. Even more astonishing is its revenue backlog: over $100 billion in committed contractual revenue that has yet to be recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:56">[01:52:56]</a>. This means AWS could "shut down all sales efforts" and still have $100 billion in future business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>.

In 2014, Jeff Bezos stated that he believed AWS was "market size unconstrained" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:41">[01:53:41]</a>. When AWS financials were first broken out in 2015, it was a $6 billion run rate business growing at 70% annually, with a 19.2% operating margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:37">[01:55:37]</a>. By 2016, AWS generated over 50% of Amazon's operating profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:52">[01:56:52]</a>.

## AWS's Evolution and Future

AWS is essentially an "unregulated public utility" for the internet, capable of generating enormous profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:24">[01:54:24]</a>. The internet and all computing essentially "run on AWS," making it a fundamental part of modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:05">[01:55:05]</a>.

### Price Cuts and Scale Economies

AWS proactively reduced prices 51 times by 2015, without competitive pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>. This strategy mirrors companies like TSMC: giving up current profit to gain future market share and confidently invest ahead of the curve in massive infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:27">[02:24:27]</a>. AWS is a prime example of **scale economies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:54">[02:13:54]</a>. Their enormous fixed costs (data centers, servers) are amortized across a huge customer base, allowing them to offer lower prices while maintaining strong margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>.

### Evolving Definition of "Cloud"

The definition of "cloud" has evolved. Initially, it meant using primitive building blocks in Amazon's data center on a pay-as-you-go basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:44">[02:27:44]</a>. Now, it means using proprietary cloud services at a higher level of abstraction, which can even run in a customer's own data center (hybrid cloud), with Amazon employees installing and maintaining servers there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>. The core concept remains IT infrastructure accessible via an API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:21">[02:29:21]</a>.

### Focus on Customer Use Cases

AWS's success stems from its relentless focus on "make something people want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:40">[02:29:40]</a>. Unlike competitors who built clever technologies, Amazon focused on what startups and IT managers actually needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:44">[02:29:44]</a>. They prioritize customer use cases before investing engineering resources, even delaying entry into hyped areas like blockchain until clear customer needs were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:10">[02:30:10]</a>.

### Asymmetric Upside

Jeff Bezos's philosophy, articulated in his 2015 letter, emphasizes taking bets with "asymmetric upside": a low chance of a massive payoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>. He compares it to baseball, where returns are truncated, but in business, a single "home run" can pay for "so many experiments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:26">[02:31:26]</a>. AWS itself was such a "venture bet" within Amazon's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:56">[02:32:56]</a>.

### Enterprise Stickiness and "No Kill" Policy

Unlike [[amazoncoms_early_business_strategy_and_growth | Amazon.com]]'s consumer businesses (like the Fire Phone), AWS rarely "kills" a service for enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:41">[02:34:41]</a>. Burning customer trust by deprecating a service is a greater risk than maintaining a less optimal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:56">[02:34:56]</a>. This commitment to maintaining services, even those with cost issues like SimpleDB, contributes to the vast number of AWS services (over 200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:33">[02:35:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

AWS's market share is approximately 39% (Azure 21%, Alibaba 10%, Google 7%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:03">[01:58:03]</a>. While they face competition, especially from Microsoft, their early dominance, focus on customer needs, and continuous innovation (e.g., custom-designed chips like Trainium and Inferentia for machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:37">[01:58:37]</a>) have cemented their leadership.

AWS is a prime example of **counter-positioning** (doing what incumbents won't), unparalleled **scale economies**, strong **switching costs** (data migration challenges), and powerful **branding** as the market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:41">[02:13:41]</a>. Their only "miss" has arguably been in the data warehouse market, where Snowflake, a $50 billion company, built on AWS's infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.

The conversation with [[interviews_with_industry_leaders | Mark]] Zuckerberg at Acquired Live was described as "beyond anything that we could have hoped or dreamed for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The atmosphere in the arena was electric, and Zuckerberg was "so on" during the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Unscripted and Historic Dialogue

From the very beginning, Zuckerberg "threw away the playbook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, joking about needing to book a future event for all the things he might have to apologize for or say that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This led Ben to turn off his iPad, realizing the conversation was going to be unscripted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The shift in Zuckerberg's posture, from "lean back to lean forward mode," was noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, suggesting a deep engagement with the topics. The hosts felt it could be a "historic conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

The questions posed to Zuckerberg were framed to help with a "meta episode research live on stage in front of everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Acknowledging a 20-Year Mistake

A pivotal moment occurred when Zuckerberg was asked about criticisms of [[facebooks_early_challenges_and_evolution | Facebook/Meta]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. He stated that the "political miscalculation was a 20-year mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This admission, particularly from a public company CEO, left the audience "jaw dropped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The hosts emphasized the significance of this statement: "Not only did I make a mistake, I made it 8 years ago. And we're 8 years into a 20-year mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This level of candor and accountability was highlighted as making [[facebooks_early_challenges_and_evolution | Facebook/Meta]] a "special company" and Zuckerberg a "special" individual, with "nobody else in the world who would say that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

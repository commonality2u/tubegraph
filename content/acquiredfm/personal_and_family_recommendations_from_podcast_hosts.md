## Parenting & Family Carve Outs

### Running Stroller Recommendation
[[personal_reflections_and_advice_from_hosts_ben_gilbert_and_david_rosenthal | Ben Gilbert]] received the Thule Urban Glide 3 running stroller as a Father's Day gift when his son turned six months old, which is considered a safe age for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. He highly recommends it for parents who want to run with a small child, noting that his son enjoys it and it helps him get his miles in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Family Vacation at Aulani (Disney Resort in Hawaii)
[[personal_reflections_and_advice_from_hosts_ben_gilbert_and_david_rosenthal | David Rosenthal]] took his family, including a one-year-old and a three-month-old, to the Disney Resort in Hawaii called Aulani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. He described it as perfect for young families and harried parents seeking a relaxing Hawaii vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. While it's not the "nicest resort" or a "Disney park" with rides, it excels at meeting the needs of young families for an enjoyable and relaxing trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. [[personal_reflections_and_advice_from_hosts_ben_gilbert_and_david_rosenthal | David]] "highly, highly recommend[s]" it for those in a similar life stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## Other Personal Recommendations

### Sunglasses: Meller
[[personal_reflections_and_advice_from_hosts_ben_gilbert_and_david_rosenthal | Ben Gilbert]] recommended Meller (meller.me) sunglasses after purchasing a pair in Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. He praised the quality of the polarized lenses, stating they are the highest quality he has ever had for the price point ($59) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. He noted that when wearing them, he could "see better than I can with my own plain eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### NFL Documentary Series: Quarterback & Receiver
[[personal_reflections_and_advice_from_hosts_ben_gilbert_and_david_rosenthal | David Rosenthal]] recommended the Netflix series "Quarterback" from last year and the new "Receiver" series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. He found them both "so good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. He particularly highlighted "Quarterback" for its insight into the immense mental work and pressure faced by elite NFL quarterbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. He also enjoyed "Receiver" but noted the "very, very different Stakes" between the two positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

### Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses
[[personal_reflections_and_advice_from_hosts_ben_gilbert_and_david_rosenthal | David Rosenthal]] mentioned intentionally wearing his Ray-Ban Metas in preparation for the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a> and enjoyed using them in Hawaii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

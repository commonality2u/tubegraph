[[moores_law_and_semiconductor_technology_advancements | Moore's Law]] describes the observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every 18 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This exponential growth in computing power has profound implications for technological advancement and market expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

## The Nature of Exponential Growth
When observing [[moores_law_and_semiconductor_technology_advancements | Moore's Law]] on a logarithmic scale, a steady 10x improvement in processing power is visible roughly every seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This trend has been consistent across various generations of processors, from Intel's 386, 486, Pentium 4, and Core 2 Duo, to Apple's A7 chip in the iPhone and the more recent M1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

However, viewing this growth on a linear scale makes it appear as if little progress occurred for a long time, followed by a sudden burst of activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This is the inherent nature of exponential scales; the graph always looks like nothing happened, and then everything happened at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. For example, in ten years, the M1 chip will seem insignificant compared to future advancements, just as the Pentium 4 chip from 2000 now seems small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This phenomenon creates a perception that progress is always at a "crazy top," despite continuous exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## The Mike Moritz Corollary to Moore's Law
The same exponential pattern observed in processor power can be seen in the total market capitalization of global technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This observation led to what is dubbed the "Mike Moritz Corollary to [[moores_law_and_semiconductor_technology_advancements | Moore's Law]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

Mike Moritz, upon taking over Sequoia Capital, realized that as long as [[moores_law_and_semiconductor_technology_advancements | Moore's Law]] continued to hold, and computing power became exponentially cheaper, the markets that technology could address would continue to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

In 1990, a PC with a 486 processor cost $2,000, and only about 42% of Americans used computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Today, a smartphone, possessing a million times more computing power, costs $200 (one-tenth the price) and is owned by over six billion people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This reduction in the cost of compute has enabled technology to access larger and larger markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

While there may be market fluctuations, the underlying principle suggests that technology will always be able to penetrate larger markets as long as [[moores_law_and_semiconductor_technology_advancements | Moore's Law]] (or an adjusted version of it, accounting for advancements in GPUs like Nvidia's) continues to deliver 10x improvements in computing every five to seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Broader Implications
The continuous waves of technological advancement driven by [[moores_law_and_semiconductor_technology_advancements | Moore's Law]] mean that it's "never too late" to innovate or invest in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. Each significant increase in computing power creates new markets and paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. This ongoing progression suggests that one is always on the cusp of the next generation of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

The internet, a key enabler of this trend, has both vastly concentrated returns to scale for underlying platforms (e.g., Amazon, Shopify) and enabled the viability of long-tail, niche markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. This "barbell effect" means companies must either scale up massively or niche down effectively, avoiding the vulnerable "middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. This dynamic, initially observed in media, is likely to ripple through other industries like venture capital and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

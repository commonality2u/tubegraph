In the realm of investment, assessing a company's future potential and its current market value is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. All investments are ultimately valued by the discounted worth of their future cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, this calculation inherently demands judgments about the future, even for seemingly steadfast companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, as consistency can be disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Historical Business Stability vs. Modern Day Volatility

Historically, businesses enjoyed a level of durability that is increasingly rare today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### The Case of Newspapers: A "Stalwart" Industry Disrupted
Newspapers were once considered an impregnable industry with strong "moats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>:
*   **Local Entrenchment**: No significant competition from neighboring towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Low Cost**: Only 15 cents, ensuring continued purchases even in tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Advertising Dominance**: Advertisers sought papers with the most circulation, making them essential for local movies, want ads, and car ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Built-in Demand**: A one-day shelf life meant consumers had to buy it again tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Despite these perceived advantages, 20 years later, most companies in the newspaper industry are struggling for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The idea that consumer behavior would shift en masse and quickly to consuming everything on interconnected computers, which barely existed then, would have sounded "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Similarly, predicting TikTok's dominance over Facebook's Instagram, which had seemingly mastered consumer attention, would have been met with disbelief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### The Accelerating Pace of Technological Adoption
There are widely circulated charts illustrating the [[impact_of_technology_on_business | speeding up of technological adoption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This acceleration has made it significantly harder for companies to maintain durability today compared to the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. In 1950, one could confidently identify many businesses that would remain consistent for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Today, without understanding a management's efforts to entrench their moats, fend off competition, or continuously evolve, it's very difficult to assert a business's consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Few businesses can operate without active management in this rapidly changing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

In the mid-20th century, the world felt like a "consistent backdrop" where actors performed, but the stage itself remained unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There were business cycles, but the underlying nature of the world seemed constant, unlike today where "everything changes every minute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Implications for Company Valuation and Growth
Given that the future is more uncertain, disruption is more likely, and moats are less permanent, a question arises: should companies be valued less? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

This situation presents a double-edged sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>:
*   On one hand, companies are more susceptible to disruption without careful management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   On the other hand, for companies that possess competitive advantages and continuously leverage them, the potential for value creation has arguably never been higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This involves using advantages to enter adjacent markets, launch new products, or expand geographically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The internet, in particular, enables businesses to address global markets, a stark contrast to past limitations like newspapers being unable to serve even the next town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

In 1999, [[History of Qualcomm | Qualcomm]] made pivotal [[Strategic decisions in the telecommunications industry | strategic decisions]] that fundamentally reshaped its business model, leading to its current dominance in the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. These decisions involved divesting capital-intensive manufacturing operations to focus on high-margin licensing and semiconductor design.

## The Problem: Capital Intensive Operations

Leading up to January 1999, [[Qualcomms business strategy and growth | Qualcomm's]] stock performance was largely flat, and Wall Street was critical of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This was primarily because its manufacturing operations and joint ventures required substantial capital, tying up a significant portion of the company's profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. These capital-intensive activities were perceived as a serious drag, diverting potential free cash flow and hindering reinvestment in research and development (R&D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Divestment of Infrastructure Business

In March 1999, [[Qualcomms business strategy and growth | Qualcomm]] began to address this issue by selling its infrastructure business, which included base stations, to Ericsson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This sale was part of a settlement deal resolving various lawsuits between the two companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The move signaled [[Qualcomms business strategy and growth | Qualcomm's]] realization that it no longer needed to bootstrap its strategy by manufacturing its own base stations, having achieved sufficient momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Approximately 1,000 of [[Qualcomms business strategy and growth | Qualcomm's]] 9,500 employees transferred to Ericsson as part of this deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, these transferred employees were reportedly upset about losing their [[Performance of Qualcomm stock during the tech bubble | Qualcomm stock]] options and even filed a class-action lawsuit against the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Sale of Mobile Phone Business

Following the infrastructure divestiture, [[Qualcomms business strategy and growth | Qualcomm]] turned its attention to its mobile phone business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. In December 1999, the company sold this division to Kyocera, a Japanese company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This completed [[Qualcomms business strategy and growth | Qualcomm's]] transition away from hardware manufacturing.

## The New Business Model

With these divestitures, [[Qualcomms business strategy and growth | Qualcomm]] solidified its new business model, focusing on two primary groups:
*   **Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QTC)**: Responsible for selling semiconductor chips (designs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)**: Dedicated to licensing [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm's extensive patent]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

This new model eliminated the drag of manufacturing and allowed [[Qualcomms business strategy and growth | Qualcomm]] to capitalize on its high-margin revenue from licensing patents and selling semiconductor designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Their licensing terms were often based on a percentage of the total phone sale price, regardless of the phone's price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Given [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm's ownership of critical patents]], companies had limited alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Immediate Market Reaction

After the sale of the handset business in December 1999, [[Qualcomms business strategy and growth | Qualcomm's]] stock performance dramatically improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. During the height of the dot-com bubble in the year 2000, [[Qualcomms business strategy and growth | Qualcomm]] became the single best-performing stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Its stock appreciated by an astounding 2621% in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

However, this peak was short-lived. The stock crashed significantly over the next 18 months, settling at approximately 4x its pre-1999 high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[Impact of regulatory and market forces on Qualcomm | Qualcomm's]] business practices, particularly its patent licensing model, would later face [[Legal challenges faced by Qualcomm | legal challenges]] and anti-trust lawsuits from entities like Apple and the DOJ/FTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Today, [[Qualcomms revenue and semiconductor business | Qualcomm's total revenue]] is close to $40 billion annually, with approximately 85% derived from its semiconductor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They are now the largest fabless semiconductor company globally, surpassing Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This success is directly attributed to the strategic decisions made in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

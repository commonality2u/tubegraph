The [[chase_center_live_show_event | Acquired Live at Chase Center]] was a landmark event for the [[acquired_podcast_and_community_engagement | Acquired podcast]], marking its significant growth and celebrating a decade of content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>. The event was held at the Chase Center in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, providing an unprecedented physical instantiation of the Acquired brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## Origin and Partnership

The idea for the [[chase_center_live_show_event | Chase Center live show event]] emerged during a call with the [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan]] team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Initially, [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan]] proposed a smaller event in a corner of the venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, both the Acquired hosts, Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, and the [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] team quickly realized the potential for a much larger, dedicated "Acquired Live at Chase Center" event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The partnership with [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] was crucial for the event's scale and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a>. [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan]] was chosen as a partner because their team deeply understands the show, being listeners themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This collaboration allowed for the achievement of something neither party could have done alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, with [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] enabling Acquired to "just be acquired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

## Acquired's Growth

Ben and David first met at a Passover seder in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. While David had ideas for a podcast, Ben initially didn't know what a podcast was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. The podcast truly broke out in the last six months leading up to the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. A Wall Street Journal feature in May 2024 significantly boosted its reach, bringing in a quarter million new subscribers overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Listeners have consumed over 5 million hours of content, with usage tripling in the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Event Preparation and [[design_and_collaboration_for_live_events | Design and Collaboration]]

Preparations for the event were intense, described as a "mad dash" to create an amazing experience for thousands of attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Key aspects of the [[design_and_collaboration_for_live_events | event planning]] included:
*   **Artist Collaboration**: The [[design_and_collaboration_for_live_events | design]] approach for Acquired had to change after seeing Don's artwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Don created stunning visuals, from posters to stage art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, including a silhouette of Ben and David emitting imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. He had never seen an entire stadium lit up with his work before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Musical Performance**: Mike Taylor, a major recording artist with hundreds of millions of Spotify listens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, was invited to perform the Acquired theme song live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Guest Coordination**: Confirmed guests included Emily Chang, Daniel X, and Mike Taylor of [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   **Host Attire**: Ben Gilbert received a jacket from Hermes for the walk-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **[[ticket_presale_and_audience_coordination | Ticket Presale and Audience Coordination]]**: Tickets were nearly sold out, with only about 300 remaining close to the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

Leading up to the event, a tradition shared with the audience involved Ben and David going for a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This run provided an opportunity to spend time with over 100 listeners and help calm nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## The Live Event Experience

The hosts were introduced to the stage amidst roaring applause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, officially welcoming everyone to "Acquired Live at the Chase Center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. The atmosphere was described as "unbelievable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

### Mark Zuckerberg's Appearance

A highlight of the event was the interview with Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. The arena was completely filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>, and his presence created an "electric feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. Zuckerberg immediately threw away the playbook from his first word, prompting Ben to turn off his iPad and engage in a lean-forward discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

A particularly notable moment came when Ben and David asked Zuckerberg about criticisms of Facebook/Meta, specifically regarding political miscalculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. Zuckerberg's response that he had made a "20-year mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a> left the audience and hosts astonished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. This candid admission from a public company CEO was highlighted as unique and indicative of a special company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This marked a significant [[previous_san_francisco_live_show_with_mark_zuckerberg | previous San Francisco Live Show with Mark Zuckerberg]] appearance.

## Impact and Future

The event was deemed a resounding success, "beyond anything that could have been hoped or dreamed for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. The partnership with [[contribution_of_jp_morgan_and_event_planning | JP Morgan Payments]] was critical, making the event possible and ensuring its high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

While reflecting on "what's next," the hosts acknowledged a mixed mindset of wanting to "go big" but also "never again" due to having young families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. However, there were hints of future events, with discussions pointing towards 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. There was also a humorous moment during the event where whispers circulated among the audience when "Jamie Dimon," the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, was "welcomed" to the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

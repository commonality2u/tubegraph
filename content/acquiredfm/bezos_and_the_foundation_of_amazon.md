## Early Career and Influences

Upon graduating college in 1986, [[jeff_bezos_early_career_at_a_startup | Jeff Bezos]] began his career at a startup called Fitel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Founded by computer science professors from Columbia, Fitel developed early network technology for high-speed trading applications, which was a precursor to co-located data centers used in modern finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Bezos spent two years there, building infrastructure for the emerging field of quantitative trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This experience provided him with a fundamental understanding of networked computing and its practical implications, including how to interpret data like bits, bytes, and packet counts, and what hardware could support specific bandwidths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

In 1988, Bezos transitioned into banking, joining the investment bank Bankers Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Given his technical background, it is assumed he continued in quantitative trading and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Bankers Trust later became part of Deutsche Bank through mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

During this period, Bezos befriended Halsey Minor, and they nearly started a financial newsletter business together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Although that venture didn't materialize, Minor went on to found CNET, a company focused on distributing the written word over the burgeoning World Wide Web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This shared focus on leveraging new internet technologies to distribute information foreshadowed [[Amazons early history and founding | Amazon's]] own business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Bezos often found it ironic that his initial venture, Amazon, would distribute physical books, despite the internet's capacity for hypertext distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Time at D. E. Shaw

In 1990, a headhunter convinced Bezos to interview at D. E. Shaw & Co., a financial firm founded a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. [[jeff_bezos_early_career_at_a_startup | Jeff Bezos]] unexpectedly "falls in love" with the firm and its founder, David E. Shaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### David E. Shaw and the Firm's Philosophy
David E. Shaw, a Stanford computer science PhD and former Columbia computer science professor, established D. E. Shaw in 1988 after a stint at Morgan Stanley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. His inspiration for the firm was Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies (RenTec), which started in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. RenTec's Medallion Fund, consisting of private capital from employees and Simons, famously averaged a 66.1% annual return from 1988 to 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Despite being a quant hedge fund, D. E. Shaw resisted being solely defined by that. They viewed themselves as a collective of "creative artisans" focused on investing in and starting businesses, valuing diverse perspectives and new ideas beyond just making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This entrepreneurial and intellectual environment appealed greatly to Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Bezos's Rise and Relationships
Bezos quickly ascended the ranks at D. E. Shaw, becoming the firm's fourth senior vice president, the highest level below David Shaw, and notably the youngest at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. He and David Shaw became very close, with Shaw serving as a mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

Bezos was heavily involved in recruiting at D. E. Shaw, which sought out the smartest individuals regardless of their finance knowledge, a philosophy similar to Bridgewater Associates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This recruitment effort brought in key early Amazon employees, including Jeff Holden and Nicholas Lovejoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

It was also at D. E. Shaw that [[jeff_bezos_early_career_at_a_startup | Jeff Bezos]] met and fell in love with MacKenzie Scott (n√©e Tuttle), a Princeton graduate who also joined the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. They married, and MacKenzie is considered the first [[Amazons early history and founding | Amazon]] employee, actively working on accounting and legal operations before the first engineer was hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Internet Opportunities at D. E. Shaw
Within D. E. Shaw's entrepreneurial environment, David Shaw assigned Bezos to lead projects exploring business opportunities beyond quantitative trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Bezos's first major project was building the "third market business," which aimed to create an off-exchange market for retail investors to trade without high commissions, serving as a predecessor to modern dark pools and payment for order flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

As the internet was in its very early stages (Mosaic and Netscape era, 1992-1993), both David Shaw and Bezos, with their strong computer science backgrounds and early exposure to the internet, recognized its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Bezos had even used the internet in college when it was purely command prompt-based, without a graphical user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Shaw reassigned Bezos to focus on identifying and developing internet-based business plans within the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. One of their initial ideas was an online retail brokerage for financial trading, similar to E-Trade, which may have evolved from the third market business concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

The trajectory of [[jeff_bezos_early_career_at_a_startup | Jeff Bezos]]'s career, particularly his experiences at Fitel and D. E. Shaw, reveals a "straight line" of development, where his exposure to networked computing, entrepreneurial ventures, and the early internet laid the groundwork for the foundation of [[Amazons early history and founding | Amazon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Indeed, [[Amazons early history and founding | Amazon]] itself is often seen as an extension of Bezos's vision and intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

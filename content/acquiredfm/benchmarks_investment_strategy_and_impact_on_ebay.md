Benchmark's investment in eBay stands as one of the most significant and non-consensus deals in venture capital history, profoundly shaping both the firm's legacy and venture investing practices.

## Pierre Omidyar's Background and the Genesis of eBay

Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, had a prior background in pen computing with a company called Inc [00:00:13]. Bruce Dunleavy from Merrell Pickard Anderson and Air was an investor in Inc [00:00:21]. The pen computing space, with the arguable exception of Palm Pilot, generally did not pan out [00:00:31]. However, the investors and management of Inc pivoted the company into early e-commerce enterprise software [00:00:50]. Inc was eventually sold to Microsoft, resulting in a good outcome for all involved [00:00:59].

After Inc, Omidyar worked as an engineer at General Magic [00:01:08], which is considered a hub of innovation in Silicon Valley and invented concepts like cloud and mobile [00:01:27]. His background in pen computing made his transition to General Magic sensible [00:01:57].

While at General Magic, Omidyar famously began "tinkering around on the early internet" in his free time [00:02:04]. He started a collection of internet services he called eBay, short for "electronic Bay Area" [00:02:13]. The website was initially a rudimentary courier font site with "a bunch of different content and like some programmatic stuff" [00:02:26]. One of the core features was "auction web," which later became the primary focus [00:02:43]. At this time, Omidyar was still a full-time employee at General Magic [00:03:06].

## Early Growth and Accidental Business Model

Initially, Omidyar hosted auctions for free, with no established business model [00:03:41]. As traffic grew, his server costs "went through the roof" [00:03:45]. Reluctantly, he began to ask users for a small listing fee to cover expenses [00:03:48]. Famously, users sent checks to his apartment, inundating him with mail he couldn't open fast enough [00:03:59]. This influx of payments was a clear sign of "product market fit" [00:04:04].

To manage the incoming checks, Omidyar brought on Jeff Skoll, a newly minted MBA from Stanford Business School, as the "business guy" [00:04:10]. The necessity of covering server costs is credited with preventing eBay from becoming a non-profit entity like the Linux Foundation or Craigslist, instead transforming it into a leading internet company [00:04:29]. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, eBay was seen by many as analogous to today's "FAANG" companies [00:04:47].

## Seeking Venture Capital Investment

Once Omidyar decided to build eBay as a formal business, he recognized the value of venture capitalists (VCs) and a professional board, drawing from his experiences at Inc and General Magic [00:05:04]. He remembered Bruce Dunleavy from the Inc days [00:05:23].

Omidyar and Skoll pitched eBay to "just about everybody else" on Sand Hill Road, and "literally everybody else" turned them down [00:05:27]. This rejection highlights the [[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_early_ebay_development | challenges and misconceptions in early eBay development]] within the VC community.

## Benchmark's Unique and Non-Consensus Investment

Benchmark, however, was interested [00:05:37]. Bruce Dunleavy, along with partners Bob and David, showed keen interest, with Bob focusing on consumer psychology and David offering to help build the management team [00:05:47]. The entire Benchmark team collaborated on the deal [00:06:04].

Benchmark offered Pierre and Jeff a term sheet to invest $6.7 million in a Series A financing round at a $20 million pre-money valuation [00:06:10]. This was a highly non-consensus move in [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | venture capital strategies]] at the time.

### Competing Acquisition Offer: Knight Ridder

Omidyar and Skoll had one other competing offer: an acquisition offer from Knight Ridder, a large newspaper conglomerate [00:06:20]. The offer was for $50 million [00:07:34]. At the time, eBay was growing 10% month-over-month and was already profitable, generating cash flow [00:07:11]. The offer was compelling, especially considering the nascent stage of the company, which was "barely a company" with only two people [00:07:52].

### The Secondary Transaction Controversy

There is ongoing debate about the precise structure of Benchmark's investment, particularly regarding a "secondary" component [00:07:57].
*   It is largely believed that eBay, being profitable from the start, "didn't actually burn any of the money" invested by Benchmark that went to the company's balance sheet [00:08:20].
*   Benchmark secured 20% or more of eBay's equity [00:08:49]. Reports from *The Washington Post* stated that Benchmark owned 22.1% at IPO [00:08:57].
*   *The Washington Post* also reported that Benchmark structured equity-backed loans of $750,000 each to Pierre Omidyar and Jeff Skoll [00:09:03]. This effectively served as an incentive for them not to take Knight Ridder's acquisition offer, functioning as a secondary transaction to allow the founders to take some money off the table [00:09:16].
*   Some accounts suggest that as much as $3 million (50%) of the $6.7 million investment round was used as a secondary [00:09:50].
*   Conversely, other accounts deny any secondary transaction occurred [00:09:57].

Despite the conflicting reports, the existence of equity-backed loans mentioned in SEC filings and *The Washington Post* suggests "at least something" in the way of a secondary [00:10:01]. This highly untraditional and non-consensus approach, later recognized as a valuable strategy to prevent early company sales, was unique to Benchmark at the time [00:10:32].

## eBay's Growth and IPO

The deal was finalized in the summer of 1997 [00:11:29]. Just over a year later, in September 1998, eBay went public [00:11:37]. During this period, Benchmark, particularly David, was heavily involved in recruiting Meg Whitman from Hasbro (and previously Disney and Bain) to serve as CEO [00:11:43].

Wall Street "loved" the eBay story [00:12:08].

## Benchmark's Staggering Returns

At the IPO in September 1998, Benchmark's $6.7 million investment was valued at $400 million [00:12:11].
Due to a six-month lockup period, Benchmark could not distribute their shares immediately [00:12:22]. By the time the lockup expired in the spring of 1999, that same stake was worth over $4 billion [00:12:28].

This meant a $6.7 million investment from an $85 million fund generated $4 billion in a little over 18 months, or less than two years [00:12:38]. This return alone represented a 47x multiple on their fund [00:12:51].

If the reported secondary kicker of equity-backed loans (totaling $1.5 million from the $6.7 million investment, or potentially $3 million) was true, that would have added another $1 billion to their returns, an additional 12x on the fund [00:13:03]. Regardless of the exact figures, Benchmark distributed at least $4 billion in real returns to its limited partners [00:13:28].

Even with the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, eBay's value did not drop to zero [00:13:45]. At the time of a publication called "eBoys," the fund was marked at 92x, and it is known that at least a 50x return was achieved, given the $4 billion distributed to LPs [00:14:02].

This monumental success meant that the standard fund structure, where the first 1x return goes back to LPs before general partners (GPs) participate in the carry, became a "rounding error" [00:14:25]. Even by the most conservative estimates, this investment generated $1.5 billion in carry dollars to be distributed among Benchmark's equal partnership [00:14:38]. Famously, Benchmark distributed pieces of carry to their assistants, making them multi-millionaires [00:15:03].

This deal, particularly its non-traditional elements like the potential secondary, highlights how Benchmark's [[benchmarks_investment_strategies_and_notable_deals | investment strategies and notable deals]] set them apart and led to extraordinary [[financial_outcomes_from_ebays_growth_and_ipo | financial outcomes from eBays growth and IPO]]. The [[history_and_evolution_of_benchmark | history and evolution of Benchmark]] were significantly shaped by this landmark investment.

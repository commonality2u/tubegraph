The perspective that "not all software is created equal" has been a significant theme over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This belief also extends to other technologies, such as AR, where "not all AR is created equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of Software

In 2000, the largest sector of software was databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. At that time, the aggregate enterprise value of companies primarily deriving revenue from databases was approximately a trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Future of Data and Decision Making

Today, more data is produced every year than in all previous years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This ever-increasing volume of data necessitates a home, and the future will see even more sensors built to gather additional data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Bill Gates once predicted that in the future, all this stored data would be analyzed by machines to help people make better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He emphasized how barbaric current decision-making methods were, foreseeing a future where data-driven machine analysis would aid in areas like diagnosing illnesses, educating dyslexic children, and maintaining aircraft engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Strategic Focus on Cloud Infrastructure

Given this outlook, there was a strong view that the entire database market would be re-architected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This transformation was expected to occur in the cloud, with new solutions purpose-built for cloud environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Consequently, a significant focus was placed on the cloud's infrastructure layer and the necessary enablement to bring enterprises into the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This strategic focus proved to be highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

As an investor, two primary skills are essential: the ability to assess a company's future potential and the understanding of its current market worth relative to its selling price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. All equity investments are fundamentally valued by the discounted sum of their future cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This valuation requires judgments about a company's future, regardless of how stable it may seem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Nature of Value and Disruption

Even seemingly unassailable companies can face disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Newspapers, once considered impregnable businesses with strong moats, serve as a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. They had local monopolies, low prices, and consistent demand for advertising, including local movies, want ads, and car ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Their one-day shelf life ensured repeat purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Yet, within 20 years, most companies in this industry are struggling for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The rapid shift in consumer behavior can seem unimaginable before it happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For instance, predicting the decline of newspapers due to the internet's rise would have sounded irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Similarly, foreseeing a Chinese short-form video company (TikTok) disrupting Facebook's consumer attention, despite its acquisition of Instagram, would have been met with disbelief just a decade ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Accelerated Change and Durability

Technological adoption has significantly accelerated, leading to a reduction in the durability of companies compared to previous eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. In 1950, one could confidently identify many businesses expected to remain consistent for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Today, that number is much lower, as businesses constantly need to [[the_importance_of_adaptability_in_business_models | continuously evolve]], fend off competition, and entrench their moats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Very few businesses can succeed today without active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

In earlier decades, like the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, the world felt more stable, with a consistent backdrop for economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Today, change is constant and rapid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Implications for Valuation and Opportunity

The increased uncertainty regarding future disruption and the reduced permanence of competitive moats raise a fundamental question: should companies be valued less due to these factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>?

This evolving landscape presents a double-edged sword:
*   **Risks:** Without proactive management, companies are more susceptible to disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The notion of a business staying consistent [[the_importance_of_adaptability_in_business_models | without minding of the ship]] is largely outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Opportunities:** For companies that leverage their competitive advantages and [[the_importance_of_adaptability_in_business_models | use them to enter adjacent markets, launch new products, or expand geographically]], the potential for value creation has never been higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The internet, unlike local newspapers, enables businesses to address global markets, significantly expanding their reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Therefore, while the future is more uncertain, the potential for growth and expansion for adaptable companies is also greater. When considering [[Market Pricing and Investment Pitfalls | what an investment is selling for]], it is crucial to assess both the inherent risks of a rapidly changing market and the dynamic opportunities for value creation.

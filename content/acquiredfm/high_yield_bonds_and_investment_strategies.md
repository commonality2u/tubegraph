One of the significant impediments to profitability in [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investing]] is rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Early experiences in the bond department at Citibank highlighted the value of open-mindedness and evolving one's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Pioneering High Yield Investing

In an environment where most [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]] organizations had strict rules against buying bonds rated below 'A' or 'Triple B', an opportunity arose by exploring what "high yield bonds" meant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. When there are no other bidders at an auction, it's typically a favorable situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Michael Milken's Early Insights

Michael Milken, who graduated from Wharton in the same year as the speaker from Chicago (1969), had a long-standing interest in low-rated bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Milken reportedly discovered a famous book called "Hickman," which analyzed bond experiences from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This book revealed that the lower a bond's rating, the higher its actual rate of return was, not just its promised yield, but its realized total return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Even though this period included the Great Depression and some defaults, the excess yield offered for these bonds was more than sufficient to offset credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This was an "aha moment" for Milken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

At that time, it was nearly impossible to issue low-rated bonds, which were often called "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Major banks and underwriters avoided them, with Moody's Manual defining a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In 1978, Moody's stated that these bonds were "not proper for [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]] regardless of price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Understanding Risk and Price in [[risks_and_rewards_of_investing_in_low_rated_bonds | Risks and Rewards of Investing in Low Rated Bonds]]

The prevailing view was that if some bonds were guaranteed to default, they were not worth investing in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This logic is akin to asking for the value of a car without considering its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A key epiphany in 1981 or 1982 illuminated this concept:

> "The most conservative companies in America are the life insurance companies. How can they insure people's lives when they know they're all going to die?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>

The answer lies in four points, which also apply to [[risks_and_rewards_of_investing_in_low_rated_bonds | high yield bonds]]:
1.  **Awareness of Risk**: The risk is known and doesn't come as a shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
2.  **Analyzable Risk**: The risk can be analyzed, for example, by assessing a person's health for an insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
3.  **Diversifiable Risk**: The risk can be diversified, avoiding concentration in only high-risk profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
4.  **Compensation for Risk**: Investors are well-paid to take the risk, meaning the policy or bond is priced to provide a margin of safety, assuming a shorter lifespan or higher default rate than actually occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

This framework allows for making money "steadily and safely" by investing in what were considered the "worst public companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_high_yield_bonds_and_the_nifty_50 | Comparison of High Yield Bonds and the Nifty 50]]

In contrast to high yield bonds, Citibank's [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]] research department in 1969 was focused on the "Nifty 50" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. These were considered the best and fastest-growing companies in America, believed to be so good that nothing bad could ever happen to them, and for which "there was no price too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

This represented the "polar opposite" of the high yield bond stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. While for the Nifty 50, no price was too high, for high yield bonds, no price was considered low enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Both stances were flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

If one had bought the Nifty 50 in September 1969 and held them for five years, they would have lost almost all their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The primary reason for this was that they were priced too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Many Nifty 50 companies were selling at Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios between 60 and 90, compared to the post-war average S&P P/E of 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Some Nifty 50 companies were not truly the "best" in the long run, and all were certainly overpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Examples include:
*   **IBM**: While once considered a safe bet, its future was not immune to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Xerox**: Lost its market to imports and had to find a new business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Patterns**: A consumer company in the Nifty 50 that did not fare well due to changing trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The concept of disruption was not considered, and competitive "moats" were perceived as inviolable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The thinking was that if a company like Xerox priced copies at 30 cents, someone from abroad could produce them cheaper, creating a "price umbrella" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This led to significant losses, with many Nifty 50 companies experiencing more than 90% declines from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

This highlights the critical importance of [[market_pricing_and_investment_pitfalls | market pricing and investment pitfalls]] and the need for a nuanced understanding of [[frameworks_for_resilience_and_optionality_in_investing | frameworks for resilience and optionality in investing]], rather than rigid adherence to perceived quality or risk categories.

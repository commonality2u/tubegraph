The semiconductor market has experienced immense growth and faced significant challenges, evolving into a trillion-dollar industry crucial to the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. The market grew from $26 billion in 1987 to $527 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>.

## The Rise of the Fabless Model and Pure-Play Foundries
The initial concept for a dedicated "pure-play" foundry, a company solely focused on manufacturing semiconductors without designing its own chips, was not immediately seen as a strong business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>. When TSMC was founded in 1987, the primary customers were Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel, who only outsourced their "worst" or least critical manufacturing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:05]</a>.

However, Dr. Morris Chang, founder of TSMC, foresaw the emergence of the "fabless" company model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>. His early insight was gained through interactions with entrepreneurs like Gordon Campbell (later founder of Chips and Technologies) and Don Valentine (founder of Sequoia Capital), who sought manufacturing services without owning their own fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:16">[02:18:16]</a>. This model allowed companies to focus solely on chip design, creating a separate vertical in the industry value chain.

The success of the pure-play foundry model is also attributed to the rise of [[the_technological_ecosystem_in_the_semiconductor_industry | ARM architecture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:51">[02:24:51]</a>. Unlike the x86 architecture, which was dominated by IDMs like Intel, ARM's ubiquity in mobile and other devices created a vast market for specialized, fabless chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:09">[02:25:09]</a>. This ecosystem consists of standalone architecture companies (ARM), manufacturing companies (TSMC), EDA (Electronic Design Automation) companies (Synopsys, Cadence), and designers (Apple, Nvidia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:04">[02:27:04]</a>.

### Hsinchu Science Park: An Integrated Ecosystem
TSMC's operational base in Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan, is a key success factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:09">[01:42:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:42">[02:27:42]</a>. This park integrates all aspects of the semiconductor ecosystem, including partners, customers, and two universities that supply highly skilled PhDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:05">[02:28:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>. This close proximity facilitates critical, real-time communication between design tool providers like Synopsys and manufacturers like TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:07">[02:29:07]</a>. The park serves as a prime example of a highly successful government-funded industry initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:06">[02:31:06]</a>.

## Key Partnerships and Major Challenges
TSMC's history is marked by crucial partnerships and significant challenges in maintaining them.

### Nvidia: Overcoming Quality and Manufacturing Issues
The partnership between TSMC and Nvidia began in 1997 when Nvidia, then a small company facing bankruptcy, sought a foundry for their promising chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Dr. Chang personally intervened after Nvidia's initial attempts to connect with TSMC's San Jose office were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Nvidia's first successful chip, the Riva 128, not only saved the company but also quickly made Nvidia a major customer of TSMC, generating over $50 million in annual revenue within two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

However, the partnership faced a major challenge in 2009 with issues on the 40-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This node suffered from manufacturing yield problems and quality issues, costing customers like Nvidia significant time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. When Dr. Chang returned as CEO in 2009, resolving the Nvidia dispute was a top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>. After familiarizing himself with all aspects of the problem, Dr. Chang offered Nvidia over $100 million in compensation, with a 48-hour acceptance deadline before resorting to arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. Nvidia accepted the offer, cementing a strong, lasting partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

### Apple: Strategic Decisions and Competitive Landscape
TSMC's pursuit of Apple's business was strategic, recognizing the immense potential of the smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>. However, Apple operates as a "close-mouthed company," which prefers to initiate contact when ready, making initial outreach difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>. A meeting was eventually facilitated by Terry Gou, founder and CEO of Foxconn and a relative of Dr. Chang's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.

Apple's Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Williams, approached TSMC in 2011 to request manufacturing on the 20-nanometer node, a "half-step" or "detour" from TSMC's planned progression from 28nm to 16nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. This posed a challenge as TSMC's R&D resources at the time were not sufficient to develop two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. Despite the significant capital expenditure already committed to 28nm (approximately $6 billion) and Apple not being included in original planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>, TSMC decided to proceed, raising billions through corporate bonds rather than cutting dividends or issuing new stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. TSMC ultimately agreed to serve half of Apple's initial demand for the 20nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:23">[01:25:23]</a>.

Intel, Apple's existing supplier for Macs, attempted to secure the iPhone chip business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>. However, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, informed Dr. Chang that Intel "just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This highlighted a key difference: TSMC's customer-centric approach, responding courteously to every request (even "crazy" or "irrational" ones), contrasted with Intel's perceived arrogance in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

A setback occurred when Apple initially placed orders for the 16nm node with Samsung, which had been able to "skip" the 20nm development that TSMC undertook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>. Dr. Chang was "shocked" by this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:01">[01:52:01]</a>. However, Jeff Williams reassured TSMC that Apple would buy from them as soon as TSMC's 16nm was ready, and ultimately, most of Apple's 16nm requirements still belonged to TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>. This incident underscored the value of TSMC's pure-play model, as Samsung was also a direct competitor to Apple in end products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:13">[01:55:13]</a>.

## Internal Management and Strategic Decisions
Dr. Chang's return as CEO in 2009 was prompted by several internal issues, including continued manufacturing problems on the 40nm node, declining gross margins due to falling prices outpacing cost reductions, and controversial layoffs by the previous CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>. The layoffs, based on poor performance reviews, deviated from TSMC's usual policy of probation and transfers, leading to employee protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:12">[02:21:12]</a>.

Upon his return, Dr. Chang reversed the layoff policy, offering rehire to affected employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>. He also addressed the company's R&D strategy, setting a fixed annual R&D budget of 8% of revenue, a significant increase from previous negotiations, which greatly empowered the R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. This commitment to R&D, combined with a threefold increase in capital expenditures to almost $6 billion in 2010, was a "bet the company" move on the 28-nanometer node, driven by the R&D team's belief that it would be a "sweet spot" for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. This decision, though questioned by the board, ultimately coincided with the smartphone era and proved highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

Dr. Chang also restructured the company's internal organization, merging previously split "advanced technology" and "mainstream technology" groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. He re-established a central business development department, which had been his personal focus in earlier years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. This role, focusing on strategic marketing and identifying future markets, was given to C. C. Wei, who later became TSMC's CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

### [[scale_economies_in_the_semiconductor_industry | The Learning Curve]] and Market Dominance
The [[scale_economies_in_the_semiconductor_industry | learning curve]] theory, refined by Dr. Chang during his time at Texas Instruments in collaboration with Bruce Henderson and Bill Bain of Boston Consulting Group, became a fundamental principle for TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:59">[02:02:59]</a>. The core insight is that as a company produces more of a product, its unit cost decreases due to gained experience and efficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:14">[02:03:14]</a>.

In the semiconductor industry, this translates to prioritizing volume to achieve the lowest cost, which then attracts more business, creating a flywheel effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>. This strategy involves accelerating pricing to anticipate future lower costs and even operating unprofitably in early node generations to outcompete and gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:31">[02:38:31]</a>.

> "If you get to be the largest volume player, this is a fixed cost business, this is a economy's business. We can spread that fixed cost over the maximum number of customers. How do we get to the maximum number of customers in the early stages of the game where it's more competitive, we accelerate the pricing to where we think it will get to at the end of the game." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>

The industry also exhibits natural monopoly characteristics due to the enormous capital expenditure required to build new fabs (currently around $20 billion, projected to increase to $40-100 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>. Combined with significant R&D investments (like TSMC's 8% of revenue commitment), this creates a powerful competitive advantage for market leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:19">[02:42:19]</a>.

## Competitive Dynamics
The pure-play foundry model contrasts with the strategy of IDMs like Intel, which historically upgraded existing fabs for Leading Edge technology, thus losing capability for older process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:50">[02:33:50]</a>. TSMC, however, maintained and continued to operate older fabs (some from the late 1980s), which, being fully depreciated, generate high-margin revenue from less demanding applications like automotive parts or CMOS sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:03">[02:35:03]</a>.

TSMC's relationship with Qualcomm also illustrates competitive dynamics. For years, Qualcomm primarily used IBM as its foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>. However, in the late 1990s, Qualcomm shifted business to TSMC, leading Dr. Chang to correctly deduce that IBM's semiconductor business was in trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. When IBM later approached TSMC for co-development on the 0.13 micron node, TSMC declined, anticipating the difficulties of such a partnership and the cultural differences, choosing instead to rely on its own internal process development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:46">[01:59:46]</a>. IBM then partnered with UMC, which later regretted the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>. This foresight, a benefit of being a foundry, allowed TSMC to anticipate market shifts and maintain its strategic independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:11">[02:08:11]</a>.

## Conclusion
The [[development_and_impact_of_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor industry]]'s remarkable growth is underpinned by [[technological_advancements_and_supplier_impacts_in_semiconductors | Moore's Law]], a continuous exponential increase in computing power demanded by the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:19">[02:44:19]</a>.

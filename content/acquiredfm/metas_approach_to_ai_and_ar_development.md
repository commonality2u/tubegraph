Meta Platforms Inc., under the leadership of Mark Zuckerberg, positions itself as a "social connection company" rather than merely a "social app company" or "social media company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This core identity drives its long-term vision, focusing on building the future of human connection, which extends beyond mobile phones to new computing platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## Envisioning Future Platforms: AR Glasses and AI

Zuckerberg's vision for the ideal social experience moves beyond small phone screens towards smart glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. These glasses are envisioned to:
*   **Act as an [[Innovations in augmented reality and AI by Meta | AI assistant]]**: By being able to see what the user sees and hear what they hear, the glasses gain context, making them a "perfect AI assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Project Holograms**: The glasses would project images, or holograms, into the real world, enabling social experiences unconstrained by phone screens and delivering a realistic sense of presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Integrate AI**: This future platform is seen as the "ultimate incarnation of AI" where physical and holographic interactions with people and embodied AIs can seamlessly coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

### Development Challenges and Strategy

Meta has been working on this "huge project" for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. The development involves significant technological challenges:
*   **Novel Display Stack**: Creating holographic displays distinct from traditional screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Miniaturization**: Fitting complex components like chips, microphones, speakers, cameras, eye-tracking, and all-day batteries into a sleek, good-looking glasses form factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **New RF Protocols**: Developing novel radio frequency protocols for connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

To approach this grand vision, Meta adopted a dual strategy:
1.  **Long-term "Big Thing"**: Continuing to develop the full augmented reality (AR) glasses, with prototypes nearing completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
2.  **Iterative "Practice Project"**: Partnering with EssilorLuxottica for Ray-Ban branded smart glasses (Ray-Ban Stories), initially conceived as a "practice project" to fit existing technology into stylish glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

The rise of [[Evolution of AI development | Large Language Models (LLMs)]] and the "ChatGPT moment" led Meta to pivot its existing smart glasses, making [[Innovations in augmented reality and AI by Meta | Meta AI]] the primary feature, leveraging their built-in cameras and microphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This pivot was a quick decision, with a prototype built within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: A Technology Company Focused on Learning

Zuckerberg attributes Meta's sustained success through multiple technology waves (e.g., Myspace, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, Apple's App Tracking Transparency) to its identity as a "technology company that is focused on human connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This means:
*   **Strong Technology Foundation**: Unlike many companies that "thought about themselves too narrowly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>, Meta has consistently invested in underlying technology and ensured its leadership and board include technically skilled individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
*   **Curiosity and Learning**: Meta operates as a "curious and learning focused organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. Its product strategy is centered on iterating and learning as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: The company prioritizes shipping products early, even if "almost at the line of being embarrassed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>, to gather feedback and learn quickly. This contrasts with approaches like Apple's, which focuses on long polishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   **Discovery in Product Creation**: While there are inventions (like News Feed in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>), Meta is not "embarrassed about learning from things that other people like discovered that were good first" and then building better versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. This open approach acknowledges that "there are more smart people outside of your company than inside your company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

### The Role of [[Open source technology's role at Meta | Open Source]]

Meta's reliance on and contribution to [[Open source technologys role at Meta | open source]] technology is a significant part of its strategy:
*   **Foundation of Building**: Zuckerberg acknowledges that Meta "wouldn't have been able to get built without open source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Facebook, for instance, was one of the first major companies built on the LAMP stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.
*   **Strategic Advantage**: While Google kept its distributed computing infrastructure proprietary, Meta, coming later, open-sourced its equivalent (e.g., Open Compute) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. This fostered a community around Meta's designs, leading to industry standardization, cheaper production, and higher quality, saving billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **[[Open Source AI | Open AI]]**: Meta extends this philosophy to [[Open Source AI | AI]], specifically with models like Llama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. As a large company, Meta aims to build its own core technology platforms (AR glasses, mixed reality, AI) to avoid full dependence on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. Open-sourcing these technologies, like [[Open Source AI | AI]], creates ecosystems that improve with broader usage, benefiting Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.

### Long-Term Vision and Challenges

Zuckerberg believes the investment in Reality Labs and [[Innovations in augmented reality and AI by Meta | AI]] is a long-term play, aiming for ubiquity akin to smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>. The strategic value lies in controlling the platform, potentially doubling profitability by avoiding "taxes" and restrictions imposed by other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.

This commitment to new platforms is also driven by a desire to build "awesome" things â€“ products that are uplifting and inspiring, beyond just being "good" and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>. While social media products are "good" (used by 3.3 billion people daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>), Meta aims to build more "awesome" experiences with [[Metas approach to the metaverse and its implications | Reality Labs]] and [[Innovations in augmented reality and AI by Meta | AI]] in the next 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.

A major competition in the coming decade is seen as an "ideological battle" between Meta's open platform model (like Windows in the PC era) and Apple's closed, integrated model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. Meta's goal is to make "the open platforms win" to foster a more vibrant tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>. This means platforms like [[Open Source AI | Llama]] and AR glasses should be open for developers, allowing new innovations without needing permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>.

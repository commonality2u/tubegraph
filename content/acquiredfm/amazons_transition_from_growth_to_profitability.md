[[Amazons business strategies and innovations | Amazon]] has been described as transitioning into a "Day Two" company, moving from an era of rapid growth to a focus on profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This shift implies significant changes in organizational structure, innovation strategy, and market entry choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Embracing a New Stage

The idea of a "Day Two" company can be likened to a person embracing an older stage of life rather than trying to remain young forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. A company cannot remain a startup indefinitely, and attempting to do so can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

In retrospect, a decision by Jeff Bezos a few years prior to reassert control and push for "one-day delivery," while aiming to move away from squeezing suppliers for profits, is seen as the "seed of [[Amazons business strategies and innovations | Amazon]]'s kind of disastrous last few years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This era led to:
*   Dramatic over-investment in their logistics network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   A cost structure that spiraled "completely out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   Over-hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

This period is viewed as an example of losing track of a company's true stage in life and trying to remain "young forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Implications for AWS

The concept of "Day Two" also applies to [[Growth and impact of AWS on Amazons business | AWS]], though with different challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Key challenges for [[Growth and impact of AWS on Amazons business | AWS]] include:
*   A "dry up" in startup formation and the availability of "easy money" that previously flowed into the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. [[Growth and impact of AWS on Amazons business | AWS]] has historically been the "default choice" for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   Competition from companies like Microsoft Azure, which has successfully packaged its offerings to appeal to established enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

Despite these challenges, [[Growth and impact of AWS on Amazons business | AWS]] benefits from its extensive feature set, even if the interface is "pretty terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Its core strength lies in customer dependency; if a specific feature is not available elsewhere, customers cannot leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. [[Growth and impact of AWS on Amazons business | AWS]] does not deprecate features, even if they become unprofitable, as its "long-term Enterprise Value is determined by customers believing that [[Amazons business strategies and innovations | Amazon]] will continue to support them forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This policy creates customer lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Cultural and Geographic Differences

The strategy employed by [[Growth and impact of AWS on Amazons business | AWS]], particularly its emphasis on platform administration, backwards compatibility, and fostering customer trust, is consistent with the business culture prevalent in Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Companies from Silicon Valley, in contrast, are often more consumer-focused and are less trusted by enterprises due to their tendency to remove features or APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This geographic difference in business approach played a role in Microsoft's ability to retain talent during difficult times, ultimately contributing to its resurgence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

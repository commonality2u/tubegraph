The "Not Boring" empire, founded by Packy McCormick, represents a unique fusion of media and [[venture_capital_and_early_tech_investments | venture capital]], showcasing a distinctive approach to business models in both industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:58">[01:49:58]</a>. Launched just a year and a half prior to this discussion, "Not Boring" rapidly became the top business newsletter on Substack, and potentially in technology and crypto categories as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

## The Evolution of "Not Boring" as a Media Business

Packy McCormick's journey into media began with a personal newsletter, "Per My Last Email," initially a link roundup and an assignment from a writing course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:41">[02:32:41]</a>. This evolved into "Not Boring," adopting the name from a previous, unsuccessful in-person social club venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. The shift to an essay-based format blending business strategy with pop culture, inspired by writers like Ben Thompson, proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:07">[03:55:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a>. Packy's writing is characterized by a "unique whimsical voice" and a "distinct personal flair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:07">[01:55:07]</a>.

A key strategic decision was to pursue an advertising/sponsorship model rather than subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. While initially considering subscriptions, Packy prioritized audience growth, believing that direct monetization would hinder it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. He understood that a broad audience, unlike niche professional audiences (e.g., product managers paying for Lenny Rachitsky's newsletter), would not readily pay for varied content like "the Mickey Mouse Club" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. This approach led to significant revenue, reaching close to $1 million in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:57">[01:36:57]</a>.

### The Sponsored Deep Dive Format

Packy pioneered a unique sponsorship format: the "sponsored deep dive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>. Unlike traditional sponsored content, which often lacks integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>, he committed to writing pieces that were as well-researched and insightful as his regular content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. The key tenets were:
*   **Transparency**: Clearly stating upfront that the post is sponsored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: Only writing about companies he genuinely believes in and would personally invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.
*   **Value**: Providing unique, behind-the-scenes access and detailed analysis of fast-growing startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. This even led to favorable comments from Ben Thompson, noting that Packy's sponsored posts offer more in-depth information about private companies than typically available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.

This model, while unconventional, resonated with his audience, particularly founders who found these deep dives valuable for practical lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

## Integration with Venture Capital: Not Boring Capital

"Not Boring" seamlessly integrates with Packy's [[venture_capital_models_and_partnerships | venture capital]] activities through "Not Boring Capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:56">[01:53:56]</a>. This synergy is a powerful [[venture_capital_dynamics | flywheel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:11">[02:32:11]</a>:
*   **Deal Sourcing**: The newsletter serves as a "top of funnel" for deal flow. Founders, inspired by his writings or understanding his approach, reach out directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:37">[01:57:37]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: The reach and thought leadership of "Not Boring" help win competitive deals, as founders recognize the unique value of having their story amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:56">[02:07:56]</a>.
*   **Value Add**: Packy engages directly with founders on strategic problems, leveraging his insights from research and broad industry exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:04">[01:56:04]</a>.

### A New Model for Venture Capital

Not Boring Capital operates with a lean structure, enabled by platforms like AngelList <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>. AngelList provides the "backbone" â€“ handling LP relations, compliance, and data, essentially acting as an "AWS for a [[venture_capital_models_and_partnerships | venture firm]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:40">[02:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:28">[02:12:28]</a>. This allows Packy, a "solo GP," to focus on content creation and deal selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>.

His investment strategy is characterized by:
*   **High Volume**: 91 investments in Fund I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>.
*   **No Lead Investments**: He does not price rounds, write term sheets, or take board seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-0s="1159079">[01:59:07]</a>.
*   **Leveraged Diligence**: Trusting the lead investors for deep diligence and focusing on identifying what "can go really, really right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:39">[02:03:39]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Being public about his approach, including not conducting extensive individual diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>.

This model is a "reorganization of the value chain," dismantling the traditional vertical integration of [[Venture Capital Partnership Dynamics | venture firms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:35">[02:10:35]</a>.

## Benefits & Challenges of the "Solo Corporation"

Packy champions the concept of the "solo corporation," where a single person can build a highly impactful and valuable organization by leveraging modern platforms and specialized services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:12">[01:50:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:55">[02:11:55]</a>.

### Benefits:
*   **Scalability**: Achieves significant reach and revenue with minimal overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:59">[02:13:59]</a>.
*   **Autonomy**: Full control over content, strategy, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:51">[02:55:51]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: The personal voice and "class clown" persona, combined with diligent research, resonate strongly with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>.
*   **Unique Deal Flow**: The media platform itself generates investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:42">[02:04:42]</a>.

### Challenges:
*   **Key Person Risk**: The business is heavily dependent on Packy himself; without him, "Not Boring is just done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:41">[02:14:41]</a>. This also makes it "very hard to take a week off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:07">[02:15:07]</a>.
*   **Limited Bandwidth**: As a one-person operation, time for building additional businesses or expanding beyond the core content is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>.
*   **Dilution Risk**: Expanding too far beyond the core content or introducing too many external products could dilute the brand and alienate the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:30">[02:16:30]</a>.
*   **Market Dynamics**: The [[challenges_and_dynamics_of_venture_capital | optimism]] that defines "Not Boring" could face challenges during a bear market, risking reader fatigue if the tone becomes too repetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>.

## Key Principles for Success

Packy's success in leveraging media for [[venture_capital_success | venture capital success]] is built on several core principles:
*   **[[Venture capital strategies and the importance of optimism | Optimism]]**: Packy describes himself as "to a fault... optimism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>, which informs his non-snarky, pro-tech stance in his writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Openly disclosing sponsorships and investments builds trust with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.
*   **Authentic Voice**: Maintaining his unique, informal, and humorous writing style, rather than adopting a persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.
*   **Audience-First**: Assuming the audience is smart and providing well-reasoned, valuable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:10">[02:21:10]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Platforms**: Maximizing the utility of free or low-cost platforms like Substack and Twitter for distribution and AngelList for fund operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>.
*   **"Skin in the Game"**: Packy believes his investment in companies he writes about ensures his advice and analysis are grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.
*   **Process Power**: His unique, hard-to-replicate creative process for generating compelling content is a significant competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.

The "Not Boring" model highlights a new frontier where individual creators can build significant businesses and investment vehicles by authentically engaging audiences and strategically leveraging technology.

Investing in private markets, particularly early-stage [[Venture capital and investing strategies | venture capital]], offers different dynamics compared to public markets. While public markets provide abundant information, private markets are less liquid, potentially allowing for greater advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, [[Venture capital and investing strategies | venture capital]] is not necessarily "super inefficient"; getting into the right investment opportunities is competitive, and the competition to invest in successful companies is fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Reasons for Entering Venture Capital

One of the primary reasons for pursuing [[Venture capital and investing strategies | venture investing]] is that it aligns with a specific skill set:
*   **Long-term [[Qualitative judgments in venture capital | qualitative judgments]]** The process involves making long-term [[qualitative_judgments_in_venture_capital | qualitative judgments]] about the future of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This means identifying significant disparities between current investment costs and a company's potential future value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. It requires imagining what a successful business could look like a decade from now, which differs greatly from public market analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Probabilistic Endeavor** [[Venture capital as a probabilistic endeavor | Venture capital]] is inherently a probabilistic endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The goal is to find investments with extremely high expected value, even though the typical outcome for an individual investment is a complete loss of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The strategy relies on making enough of these bets so that the collective outcome generates a significant return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Additionally, [[Role of venture capitalists and angel investors | venture capitalists]] often assist these companies and strategically allocate more capital to those performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Contrasting with Traditional Investing Principles

[[Venture capital and investing strategies | Venture investing]] contrasts sharply with [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | traditional investing principles]], such as prioritizing the avoidance of "permanent capital loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Some investors are not suited for portfolios that expect individual investments to consistently achieve a certain return, like 20%, but rather embrace the variability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

One financial expert noted his own unsuitability for [[Venture capital and investing strategies | venture capital]], describing himself as "not an optimist," "not a futurist," and "financially... something of a chicken." Instead, his preference was for quantitative skills and a conservative personality, which led him to bond investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This highlights the importance of investors gravitating towards strategies that align with their personal makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Applying Traditional Lenses to Venture

Despite the differences, applying [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | traditional investing lenses]] to [[Venture capital and investing strategies | venture]] can be valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This involves:
*   **Visualizing Future Value** Imagining what a business could be worth if successful and the probability of that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This includes forecasting what the financials and "moats" of a business might look like in 10 years, considering capital requirements, potential competition, and future evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Advantage** In public markets, readily available quantitative information makes it difficult to gain an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. In contrast, [[Qualitative judgments in venture capital | qualitative judgments]] about the future are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. A knowledge advantage in venture comes from being better at:
    *   Massaging current data effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   Making superior [[qualitative_judgments_in_venture_capital | qualitative judgments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   Accurately predicting what the future holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Ultimately, successful [[Venture capital and investing strategies | venture capital]] requires an optimistic outlook and a focus on future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, in contrast to strategies focused on identifying undervalued or distressed assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

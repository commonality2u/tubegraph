Congressman Anthony Gonzalez, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, expressed significant frustration regarding the political processes and lack of legislative progress in Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Focus Areas on the House Financial Services Committee
During his term, approximately one-third of Congressman Gonzalez's time on the House Financial Services Committee was dedicated to [[Congressional Focus on Crypto | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Other major areas of focus included:
*   China-related work, particularly reforms to international financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF, which he noted were largely influenced by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Capital markets, including the GameStop "meme stock craze" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Case of Meme Stock Legislation
Congressman Gonzalez highlighted the legislative aftermath of the meme stock mania as a prime example of Washington's frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Hearings and Effort** The committee conducted a significant amount of work, including four hearings, to understand the meme stock phenomenon, drawing national media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Proposed Bipartisan Solution** A key, smart, and potentially bipartisan change would have been to shorten the settlement time for trades from two days to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This reduction would have decreased overall system risk and potentially prevented situations like Robinhood halting trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Legislative Outcome** Despite the effort, no effective [[Legislative Outcomes from the Meme Stock Mania | legislation emerged from the meme stock mania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Instead, Democrats passed a bill in the House that incorporated long-standing desired changes but was unlikely to advance in the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Political Casualty** Gonzalez described the outcome as a "political casualty," where real work yielded no practical change due to partisan dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. He noted that both parties engage in similar "junk" behavior, contributing to the "frustration of Washington" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Memorable Moments During Hearings
During the meme stock hearings, Congressman Gonzalez humorously recounted having two computers set up: one for the official hearing and another displaying the Wall Street Bets forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. He observed real-time, often critical, reactions from the forum users to members speaking during the hearing. He even noted being compared to "the guy from Hitman" by forum commentators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The history of the insulin market, particularly in the United States, is characterized by evolving scientific breakthroughs, intense competition, and complex pricing structures. The journey from its initial discovery to the modern-day landscape, including the emergence of GLP-1 drugs, reveals a dynamic interplay of supply, demand, and economic incentives.

## Early Days: Discovery and Scarcity (1920s-1970s)

Insulin was discovered and extracted in Toronto, Canada, in 1921 by a team including Frederick Banting and Charles Best at the University of Toronto Medical School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Prior to this, Type 1 diabetes was a death sentence, with the widely accepted treatment being a "starvation diet" to prolong life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The discovery of insulin was one of the most important advances in modern medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Initially, insulin was derived from animal pancreases, a process that was difficult to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. There was a significant ethical and commercial barrier to making money from medical breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. However, the world needed a large, consistent supply of animal insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

The University of Toronto licensed production and development rights to Eli Lilly, a large American drug company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Eli Lilly secured a one-year exclusive license to mass-produce insulin, and importantly, retained the right to brand their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. They scaled by sourcing cow and pig pancreases from slaughterhouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This venture significantly contributed to Eli Lilly becoming a leading pharmaceutical company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

In Denmark, where drug patents were not initially recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, Novo Nordisk's precursor, Nordisk Insulin, was founded in 1924, focused on producing insulin at cost for Scandinavia and at market prices for export to fund research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. This unique, non-profit foundation-controlled structure profoundly impacted the company's long-term [[Business Strategies and Pricing | business strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. A bitter rivalry emerged when former employees founded Novo, a competing insulin company, leading to decades of [[Ubers approach to handling competition and market dynamics | intense competition]] that drove innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

The challenge of relying on animal pancreases for insulin supply persisted. By 1980, it took one million animals annually to treat just 30,000 diabetes patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. This limitation meant that Type 2 diabetes, then known as "non-insulin dependent diabetes," was not treated with insulin due to insufficient supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>.

## The Biotech Revolution and Market Expansion (1980s-2000s)

The [[public_market_innovations_and_ipos | biotechnology revolution]], spearheaded by Genentech, transformed insulin production. In 1980, Genentech and Eli Lilly partnered to genetically engineer human insulin using recombinant DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. This breakthrough, the first drug engineered by Genentech, provided an unlimited supply of insulin chemically identical to naturally produced human insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. While the efficacy advantage over animal insulin was debatable, the manufacturing and scale advantages were clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.

This sparked a race for human insulin. Novo, after initially turning down Genentech, scrambled to chemically modify pig insulin to be identical to human insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. While ultimately a flop in terms of efficacy and a poor use of capital, Novo leveraged the biotech hype to conduct a US IPO, raising $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.

During this period, the number of Type 2 diabetes patients quadrupled from 1980 to 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. The global insulin market grew from roughly $500 million in 1980 to around $2 billion by 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>.

The two Danish rivals, Novo and Nordisk, finally merged in 1989 to form Novo Nordisk, creating a company with approximately $1 billion in insulin revenue and 50% global market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>. This merger was driven by the increasing importance of scale for R&D, trials, approval, and go-to-market in the rapidly consolidating pharmaceutical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

Despite management's initial belief that they would need to merge into a larger, diversified pharma conglomerate, Novo Nordisk continued to grow independently throughout the 1990s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>. Their revenue and profit compounded at 20%+ annually, primarily due to the expanding insulin market and the increased use of insulin to treat Type 2 diabetes, unlocked by genetic engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>. By 2003, annual revenue from insulin alone exceeded $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>.

## Modern Dynamics: Pricing Controversy and GLP-1 Disruption (2010s-Present)

Around 2015, Novo Nordisk, along with Eli Lilly and Sanofi, faced a public outcry over rising insulin prices. US officials alleged that Novo Nordisk increased prices over 600% between 2001 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:31">[02:41:31]</a>. While Novo Nordisk argued that net prices had decreased since 2017 due to rebates, the perception of exorbitant costs for an essential drug became a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:50">[02:41:50]</a>.

This period saw a "perfect storm" for the insulin business:
*   **Regulation:** Public outcry led to price caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:50">[02:41:50]</a>.
*   **Biosimilars:** The introduction of biosimilar insulins, analogous to generics for biologic drugs, further eroded profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:20">[02:42:20]</a>.
*   **GLP-1 Drugs:** The emergence of GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) drugs began to reduce demand for traditional insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:44">[02:42:44]</a>.

Novo Nordisk, already a leader in insulin, serendipitously developed semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy), a GLP-1 drug, allowing them to disrupt their own insulin franchise just as it became an unattractive business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">[02:43:02]</a>.

### GLP-1 Pricing and Market Entry

The sticker price for Ozempic (diabetes) is over $1,000 per month, and Wegovy (weight loss) is over $1,300 per month in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>. In other countries like Canada and the UK, prices are significantly lower ($147/month and $93/month respectively) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:44">[02:27:44]</a>. This highlights a uniquely American problem within [[the_pharmaceutical_industrys_structure_and_economics | the pharmaceutical industry's structure and economics]].

The US healthcare system's complexity means a patient buying a drug involves multiple intermediaries:
1.  **Manufacturer:** Develops and sells the drug.
2.  **Distributor/Wholesaler:** Buys, warehouses, and distributes drugs to pharmacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:13">[02:26:13]</a>.
3.  **Pharmacy:** Charges a price to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>.
4.  **Insurance Company:** Typically pays the pharmacy.
5.  **Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM):** Negotiates discounts (rebates) with manufacturers on behalf of insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:33">[02:24:33]</a>. These rebates can be extremely high, with Eli Lilly claiming they accounted for 75% of insulin's sticker price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:32">[02:30:32]</a>. PBMs act as gatekeepers, managing pharmacy benefits for most Americans and controlling access to drug formularies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:12">[02:28:12]</a>.

This multi-sided system leads to a "quagmire" where true demand signals and clearing prices are lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:17">[02:31:17]</a>.
Despite the high list prices, many patients reportedly pay around $300 a month after insurance, due to co-pays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. However, this still presents a significant access problem for many due to the high out-of-pocket costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:42">[02:38:42]</a>.

Insurance coverage for GLP-1s, especially for weight loss, is complicated by misaligned incentives and short time horizons. Private insurers churn patients every 3.7 years on average, disincentivizing coverage for long-term preventative care that might reduce future costs (which would be borne by a different insurer or Medicare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>. Medicare Part D is legally prohibited from covering weight loss drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53">[02:30:53]</a>, partly due to the historical stigma around obesity and past dangerous weight loss drugs like Fen-Phen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:02">[02:01:02]</a>. If GLP-1s are proven to reduce comorbidities like heart attacks, strokes, and kidney disease, there could be a massive ROI for taxpayers if Medicare covers them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>.

### Competition and Future Outlook

Eli Lilly has entered the GLP-1 market with Mounjaro (diabetes) and Zepbound (weight loss), which incorporate a second hormone (GIP) and appear to be as effective, if not more, for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:11">[02:35:11]</a>. This suggests that the GLP-1 market, like insulin before it, will see a "super cycle" of product improvements and increased supply, with ample demand and profits for multiple players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:13">[02:36:13]</a>.

Despite the current high demand, non-adherence is a significant issue, with as many as 68% of patients discontinuing GLP-1s after a year due to cost, insurance changes, supply constraints, or side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:03">[02:39:03]</a>. This impacts the perceived value for payers and raises questions about long-term sustainability and the need for comprehensive support.

Overall, the insulin market, once dominated by a few players and facing a pricing controversy, has been reshaped by the biotech revolution and the emergence of GLP-1 drugs, which hold the potential to become a far larger market than insulin ever was, fundamentally altering [[the_pharmaceutical_industrys_structure_and_economics | the pharmaceutical industry's structure and economics]].

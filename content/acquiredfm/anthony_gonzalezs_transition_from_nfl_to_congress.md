Anthony Gonzalez, a United States Congressman from Ohio, has an "incredible story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, marked by a unique transition from a professional football career to serving in the U.S. House of Representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Early Life and Collegiate/Professional Football Career

Gonzalez is the son of Cuban immigrants; his father immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba, while his mother was born and raised in Cincinnati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. His paternal grandparents settled in Cincinnati after running out of money in Ohio on a honeymoon trip from New York City to Miami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. They were driven into exile after Fidel Castro took over Cuba, as his grandfather was part of a pro-democracy movement and refused a position offered by Castro's lieutenants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. They legally immigrated to the U.S. and returned to their old jobs in Cincinnati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Gonzalez's father attended Michigan, playing for Bo Schembechler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, and later started a steel company in northeast Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Gonzalez played football at Ohio State, a decision influenced by a less-than-ideal recruiting visit to Michigan where the coach thought he was a kicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. He majored in philosophy, initially planning to attend law school, a path encouraged by his grandfather who was an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

He was drafted in the first round of the NFL draft and played two seasons for the Colts, catching passes from Peyton Manning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. A series of injuries in his third year prompted him to rethink his future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. After attending a week-long business program at HBS, he decided to go to business school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. He applied to Stanford GSB from the locker room of his final preseason game, sensing his body wasn't right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. His NFL career officially ended when Bill Belichick released him from the Patriots, a moment where Gonzalez informed Belichick of his plan to retire and go to Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

## Transition to Business and Politics

Before serving in Congress, Gonzalez ran a venture-backed startup in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. While in college, he had a long-held interest in public service, even considering running for Mayor of Cleveland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. His original plan was to enter politics later in life, after a long business career and raising a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

However, the 2016 election became a catalyst for him to run for Congress sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. He felt the country was on a "dangerous path politically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. Recognizing his district's needs, he approached his campaign like a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>, conducting "customer interviews" to understand motivations and test his message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. His core message focused on economic issues and unity, emphasizing working together to build the economy, a perspective shaped by his father's steel company in northeast Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

He adopted a structured approach to his campaign, assembling a strong team and focusing on fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. He built a custom Salesforce dashboard to track contacts and fundraising, aiming for broad support beyond just wealthy donors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. This dedication reflected his competitive nature and desire to connect with and serve his constituents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. His experiences during the campaign highlighted the intelligence and deep care voters have for issues directly affecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

## Congressional Service and Key Issues

As a Congressman, Gonzalez served on three committees: the House Financial Services Committee, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and the Climate Committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

His term in Congress included a particularly challenging period, notably the events of January 6th, 2021. He had an "uneasy feeling" following the 2020 election, observing rhetoric that he believed could lead to a "real violent outcome" if people truly believed the election was stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. On January 6th, he witnessed the Capitol breach unfold and was frustrated by the former President's delayed response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. He voted in favor of the second impeachment of President Trump, one of ten Republicans to do so in the House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. He viewed this as an "unforgivable assault on the country" and believed it was necessary to send a message to future presidents that such actions would lead to impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. This was the "hardest decision" he ever made professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

Following this, he decided not to seek re-election, citing the difficulty of balancing family life with the demands of politics, particularly the extensive travel required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

### Committee Work and Policy Focus

Gonzalez's committee work is where "real work happens," involving hearings, dialogue, and policy debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

*   **Crypto and Web3 Regulation**: He became deeply involved in understanding and regulating Web3 and crypto, particularly from 2020 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. His "aha moment" came from listening to a podcast about Flamingo DAO, prompting him to learn about different L1s, L2s, tokens, and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. To gain practical understanding, he used a small amount of money to "play around" in DeFi, subsequently donating any gains to the United Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. He believes Congress is nearing legislation, specifically around stablecoins, partly due to the Terra Luna crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Gonzalez notes that roughly 90% of Congress members do not understand crypto at all, but a small percentage, including himself, are deeply knowledgeable and working on frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. This relates to the broader [[time_spent_on_crypto_in_congress | time spent on crypto in Congress]].

    He advocates for a "do no harm" approach to regulation, similar to the Clinton administration's stance on the early internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. The goal is to allow innovation to flourish while addressing issues like tax evasion and consumer protection, focusing on "bite-sized pieces" of regulation, starting with fiat-backed stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. He believes clear definitions and guardrails for stablecoins are crucial for consumer protection and pro-innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. The uncertainty in the U.S. regulatory environment causes companies like FTX to build outside the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>.

*   **Meme Stock Mania**: Gonzalez was involved in hearings regarding the GameStop "meme stock" craze but was disappointed that no substantive legislation, such as shortening settlement times, came out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. He observed the public's real-time reactions on Wall Street Bets during the hearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>. The experience highlights [[congressional_hearings_and_challenges_in_passing_reform_bills | Congressional hearings and challenges in passing reform bills]].

*   **NCAA Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL)**: Given his background, Gonzalez has been "highly involved" with the revolution in college athletics regarding Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>. He found it illogical that college athletes were the only people unable to monetize their NIL, citing examples from his own experience wearing his jersey and his wife, a Stanford swimmer, not being allowed to teach lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. The passage of a California bill legalizing NIL set off a chain reaction in other states, leading to a "wild west" situation due to differing laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>.

    Gonzalez advocates for a national standard for NIL, providing economic rights for athletes while building in guardrails against inducements and recruiting abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. The current lack of NCAA enforcement has led to "collectives" of boosters raising marketing dollars to "buy players," which he believes handicaps coaches and is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>. He warns that if Congress doesn't step in, college athletics could become fully professionalized, leading to the dramatic cutting of non-revenue generating sports, thereby limiting opportunities for student-athletes from diverse backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

### American Dynamism and Future Outlook

Gonzalez views the "great political battle of our time" as a question of belief in American democracy, rather than a partisan divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>. He warns against the tendency on both sides to "destroy and tear down" when things don't go their way, which he sees as "poison" that emboldens authoritarian regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of civic participation, urging more people to vote in primaries to moderate politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">[01:32:08]</a>.

Regarding American industrial policy, Gonzalez's perspective is shaped by seeing the decay in industrial communities in northeast Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>. He stresses the need for a "sustainable, dynamic, and resilient economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>. Dynamism means the U.S. should lead in "every critical technology from now until eternity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:33">[01:40:33]</a>, while resiliency addresses the vulnerabilities exposed by COVID-19 in supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:18">[01:41:18]</a>. He advocates for bringing critical technologies and supply chains domestically or with trusted allies, acknowledging that U.S. manufacturing generally has higher environmental standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>. He supports government investment in R&D to invent solutions for dilemmas like cheap, sustainable steel production, similar to the Chips Act's goal of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:24">[01:46:24]</a>.

As his term concludes in January, Gonzalez's primary focus remains on passing pending legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>. He is exploring future opportunities, weighing whether to be an investor or an operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:19">[01:53:19]</a>. He aims to work with people he loves and admires, focusing on "exciting new challenges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>. His advice to founders is to focus on industries with "enormous tailwinds" that align with their skills, and to surround themselves with people they love and admire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:39">[01:56:39]</a>.

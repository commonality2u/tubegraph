## Origins in Defense and Academia

The genesis of [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] is deeply intertwined with World War II and the Cold War, driven by the needs of the U.S. government and the pioneering spirit of academic institutions. Before the 1950s, the area was known as "The Valley of Hearts Delight" and had no association with "silicon" [1:17:17].

### The Role of Radar Research and Frederick Terman
During World War II, a significant amount of U.S. and Allied radar research was conducted at MIT's Radiation Laboratory (Rad Lab) and Harvard's Radio Research Laboratory in Boston (or Cambridge) [1:02:07]. These labs were established at the direct request of the government as part of the war effort and were later shut down by MIT and Harvard after the war [1:02:30].

The head of Harvard's lab was Frederick Terman, a Stanford Professor who was on loan to Harvard during the war [1:02:47]. Terman was considered a leading world expert in radio engineering, vacuum tubes, and early computing [1:03:01]. While Boston's institutions received millions in government funding, Stanford received only about fifty thousand dollars for this work [1:03:22].

After the war, Terman returned to Stanford and implemented three key changes that directly led to the rise of [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] [1:03:49]:
1.  **Recruitment of Top Talent**: He recruited the best people he had worked with at Harvard Radio Lab from universities across the country to Stanford, offering them immediate tenure [1:03:55]. He aimed to establish Stanford as an engineering institution of the highest order [1:04:15].
2.  **Transformation of Tech Transfer**: As Provost of Stanford, Terman completely changed the university's technology transfer policy, making it notoriously friendly to commercialization [1:04:22]. Unlike other universities that demanded large equity stakes, Stanford's approach fostered [[Role of technology and innovation in venture capital and startups | innovation]] and commercial viability [1:04:41].
3.  **Creation of Stanford Research Park**: Terman carved off a significant portion of the Stanford campus to be leased as commercial space for corporations and government entities [1:07:00]. Initially called the Stanford Industrial Park, it is now known as the Stanford Research Park and still hosts major tech companies along Page Mill Road in Palo Alto [1:07:38].

Terman encouraged students and professors to leave Stanford to establish companies and work for defense firms, believing that a commercial ecosystem would foster more [[Role of technology and innovation in venture capital and startups | innovation]] and better serve the nation's needs [1:05:52]. This ethos, focused on customers and national service, transformed what would have been career suicide in academia elsewhere into a celebrated path at Stanford [1:06:40].

## The Lockheed Connection: A Foundational Employer
One of the very first and largest tenants of the Stanford Industrial Park was a new, secret division of Lockheed: the Lockheed Missile Systems Division [1:08:16]. This division, later renamed the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LMSC), would become the single largest employer in proto-[[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] by a significant margin [1:08:26]. LMSC based its operating principles on Lockheed's "Skunk Works" division, bringing their management practices to [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] [1:09:18].

Initially set up in Burbank like Skunk Works, the missile division faced two problems [1:09:47]:
1.  Having two super-secret, unmarked divisions on the main Lockheed campus was unwieldy [1:10:03].
2.  Building missiles required different disciplines than airplanes, specifically expertise in missile guidance systems, radar, and computing [1:10:28]. These were areas where Southern California lacked expertise, but [[Fred Turman]] at Stanford excelled [1:10:51].

In 1955, Lockheed moved its missile systems division to the Stanford Industrial Park [1:11:23]. As they couldn't test missiles on the Stanford campus, Lockheed purchased 275 acres in Sunnyvale, building a massive campus with 137 buildings [1:11:52]. By 1959, just four years later, Lockheed Missile Systems employed almost 20,000 people in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale, growing to 30,000 by the mid-1960s [1:12:31]. This made Lockheed by far the largest employer in the nascent [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] [1:12:47].

For comparison, Hewlett-Packard, the largest tech/computing company in the region at the time (founded by Fred Terman's students, Bill Hewlett and David Packard, whom Terman encouraged to start their company), had only 3,000 employees [1:13:05].

### Impact on Semiconductor Industry
The development of missiles required advanced computing and silicon components. William Shockley co-invented the transistor just a few years before and started Shockley Semiconductor in 1955, coinciding with Lockheed's arrival in [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] [1:14:09]. Shockley Semiconductor was a predecessor to Fairchild Semiconductor, which in turn was a predecessor to Intel [1:14:19].

Sales executives like Don Valentine (later founder of Sequoia Capital) at Fairchild Semiconductor and National Semiconductor primarily sold to defense companies, including Lockheed, which was the only one working on missiles in [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] [1:14:40]. Lockheed purchased a substantial amount of product from these early silicon startups emerging from Stanford and Shockley [1:15:20].

Notably, Jerry Wozniak, father of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, moved his family to [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] to become an engineer at Lockheed Missiles and Space Company [1:15:53]. This direct connection highlights how Lockheed's presence influenced the talent pool that would later shape the consumer tech industry [1:16:10].

## Key Projects and Innovations

Lockheed's LMCS division spearheaded two historically significant projects:

### Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (Polaris Program)
In 1955, the Navy awarded Lockheed the contract for the Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) system, named Polaris [1:23:03]. This project aimed to enable intercontinental ballistic missiles to be launched from submarines, initially from the surface and later from underwater [1:19:53]. The ability to launch nuclear missiles from mobile, hidden submarines dramatically changed the strategic landscape of deterrence during the Cold War, making a Soviet first strike impossible [1:20:36]. By 1960, the first U.S. nuclear ballistic missile-equipped submarine, carrying Lockheed Polaris A1 undersea-fired nuclear warheads with a range of up to 1,200 nautical miles, set sail [1:23:17]. This entire system was built out of [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] with numerous subcontractors [1:23:46]. The Polaris program evolved into Poseidon and then Trident missiles, with the latter achieving a 5,000-mile range [1:26:02].

### Secret Space Program (Corona, Gambit, Hexagon, Kennen)
Concurrently with early NASA missions like Mercury and Gemini, Lockheed's LMCS ran a secret U.S. space program that developed fully operational observational spy satellite systems [1:30:51]. These satellites were launched under a cover story called the "Discoverer program," which claimed to be conducting life-form research for manned spaceflight [1:31:33].

The first program was Corona, which launched its first satellite in August 1960 [1:31:52]. This satellite was capable of photographing any ground location at a resolution as low as five feet from space [1:33:40]. The very first Corona mission produced more photographic coverage of the Soviet Union than all five years of U2 flights combined [1:34:24]. Over 800,000 images were taken by these satellites during the program [1:35:00].

A unique aspect of Corona was its film return system [1:35:23]. These satellites used film, not digital photography, and the exposed film was dropped from space in a custom-designed "film bucket" (designed by General Electric) [1:35:30]. These canisters, equipped with retro-rockets, would re-enter the atmosphere, jettison a heat shield, and deploy parachutes at 60,000 feet [1:35:55]. They were designed to be caught mid-air by a passing Lockheed C-130 airplane using a "claw" [1:36:50]. If missed, the canister had a salt plug that would dissolve after two days, sinking the film to the bottom of the sea [1:37:34].

The Corona program led to further advancements [1:40:11]:
*   **Gambit (1963)**: The "see it well" phase, achieving a resolution of under two feet, surpassing the U2 cameras [1:41:09].
*   **Hexagon**: The "see it all" program, likely featuring longer orbit lifespans and greater film capacity [1:41:45].
*   **Kennen (1977)**: The "see it now" program, which was the first real-time, space-based surveillance system using digital photography and beaming images via ground link [1:42:24]. Lockheed also built the digital workstations to process and manipulate these photos [1:43:38].

LMCS also pioneered work in weather satellites [1:43:55] and contributed to the development of Global Positioning System (GPS) positioning satellites that were later opened to commercial use [1:45:04]. They also built the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA [1:45:53].

## The Silicon Valley Ethos and its Transformation

The [[Silicon Valley investment culture | commercial ecosystem]] and [[Role of technology and innovation in venture capital and startups | innovation]] hub of [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] was intentionally cultivated through the policies set by [[Fred Turman]] and the substantial military contracts awarded to companies like Lockheed. This environment encouraged students and professors to start companies, with the implicit understanding that their work served national interests, especially during the Cold War [1:05:52].

This period also saw the development of what would become the [[Silicon Valleys relationship with government and defense | "military-industrial complex"]], a term popularized by President Eisenhower [2:31:55]. While initially crucial for defense and technological advancement, this relationship evolved. The government's need to maintain a strong defense industrial base led to policies like the "Last Supper" in 1993, where Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry instructed major defense contractors to consolidate due to shrinking budgets [2:35:37].

This consolidation led to a shift away from the "Skunk Works" model of small, agile, and highly focused teams that rapidly delivered products [2:47:37]. Modern defense programs, such as the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II, became massive, multi-state, and international collaborations with thousands of subcontractors [2:52:58]. This "piecemeal manufacturing approach" was predicted to characterize future large aerospace projects [2:47:00]. While creating jobs and maintaining a broad industrial base, it also resulted in significantly increased costs per unit and slower development cycles [2:52:00].

The [[Silicon Valleys relationship with government and defense | relationship between the defense industry and government]] has become one where the government often uses "cost-plus" contracts, meaning they pay for all costs plus a set profit margin, absorbing all risk [3:02:15]. This structure ensures companies like Lockheed Martin remain profitable and protected, but it stifles the kind of operating leverage seen in [[History and strategy of technology companies | modern tech companies]] that amortize R&D across a large customer base [3:03:54].

Today, there is a recognized "disconnect" in how the Department of Defense procures software and technology compared to traditional hardware [3:05:17]. Companies like Palantir have had to adapt by selling hardware pre-loaded with software to fit the government's procurement models [3:04:30]. This suggests that while [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Silicon Valley]] was born from defense needs, the current business models and incentive structures of the established defense industry are, in many ways, incompatible with the agile, risk-taking [[Role of technology and innovation in venture capital and startups | innovation]] of modern tech startups [3:04:13].

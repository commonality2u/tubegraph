Companies may prioritize future gains over current profits to achieve customer loyalty and retention, which can lead to increased future revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The objective is to secure retention through customer loyalty or by acquiring new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This strategy prompts the question of whether more customers and future revenue will yield greater differential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Link to Future Revenue and Scale Economies

The pursuit of increased customers and revenue often leads to a consideration of [[scaling_and_feedback_mechanisms_in_subscription_businesses | scale economies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While such economies are generally present, as in the case of TSMC, they can be "pretty unusual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Unusual Industry Characteristics for Scale

Certain industry characteristics contribute to these unique [[scaling_and_feedback_mechanisms_in_subscription_businesses | scale economies]]:

*   **Large Capital Investment**
    Industries might require significant, lumpy capital investments. For instance, a new fabrication plant (fab) can cost $10 billion or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Predictable Performance Advances**
    Some sectors benefit from "predictable material performance advances," such as [[product_excellence_and_innovation_as_growth_drivers | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This allows for a "fairly high assurance" of substantial improvements (e.g., a "10x improvement in 18 months") if the correct technology choices are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Upstream Supplier Reliance**
    Technological advantages can be heavily "driven by upstream suppliers," like ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Choosing suppliers involves difficult decisions, as exemplified by historical debates in semiconductor companies regarding technologies like x-ray lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

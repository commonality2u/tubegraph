## Amazon's Machine Learning Strategy

Machine learning (ML) has become a significant pillar of Amazon's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While databases are important for stickiness, ML has seen dedicated focus, including the announcement of [[aws_machine_learning_services_like_sagemaker | SageMaker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts a custom ML keynote and offers a variety of cloud-hosted ML services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

AWS supports TensorFlow, a tool created by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Although they support external technologies like Kubernetes (an open-source system), they also promote their own alternatives such as the Amazon Container Service (ECS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Importance of Data Gravity

Amazon's strategy suggests that their machine learning capabilities, while needing to be good, do not necessarily need to surpass Google's in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The core reason is the concept of data gravity: customers will utilize the ML services available where their data resides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

[[importance_of_integrating_machine_learning_with_data_storage | Running machine learning near your data]] is considered the most critical factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Once a customer has chosen Amazon as their storage vendor and migrated their data into AWS data centers, they are unlikely to seek out different providers for their ML workloads; they will primarily run their ML on AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Google's Position in ML

Despite Google potentially being "best positioned to have better ML offerings than anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, this advantage becomes less significant if customers are not storing their data with Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This highlights Amazon's strategic advantage through its dominant position in cloud data storage.

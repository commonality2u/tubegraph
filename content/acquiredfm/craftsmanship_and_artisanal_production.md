Craftsmanship and artisanal production are core tenets of the Hermès brand, deeply ingrained in its history and operations. The company maintains an unwavering commitment to handmade goods, distinguishing itself from other luxury brands that have embraced mass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Hermès' Foundational Commitment to Craftsmanship
Hermès, initially a saddle maker, established its reputation by focusing on quality and craft from its inception in 1837 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>. This dedication means that 85% of their production is still done by hand by master craftspeople in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

The company's approach ensures that the business and the craft are intimately intertwined and cannot be separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. Unlike many other companies where business executives and creatives are distinct, at Hermès, these roles are often held by family members who apprentice with their hands, learning the craft firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.

While Hermès doesn't reject all efficiencies—Emile Hermès even adopted some production ideas from Henry Ford's assembly lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>—their focus remains on non-mechanized, human-built objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## The Saddle Stitch
A hallmark of Hermès' craftsmanship is the "saddle stitch," an exceptional and durable stitching technique primarily done by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. This method involves using two needles with a single thread, creating interlocking tensile forces that make the stitch incredibly strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. If one stitch breaks, the entire piece doesn't unravel, allowing for easy repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>. This contrasts sharply with typical machine stitching, which can easily unravel. The saddle stitch also offers a distinctive diagonal appearance, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. While originally necessary for life-threatening scenarios (like a saddle), it now provides an element of "massively overkill" quality for everyday items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>.

## Production Processes
Hermès products are renowned for their meticulous creation process:
*   **Silk Scarves**
    *   Made from the finest silks, sourced from Hermès' own farms in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:00">[49:00:00]</a>.
    *   Each new design takes two years to develop and bring to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.
    *   They are hand screen-printed, with each color requiring its own hand-etched mask or stencil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
    *   The process involves specialized artisans: designer, engraver (of each mask), colorist, weaver, printer, and finisher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.
    *   The precision is so high that if any layer is out of alignment, the whole scarf is ruined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.
    *   These processes create high competitive barriers, as the skills are non-transferable and not practiced at scale by other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>.
*   **Leather Bags (Kelly and Birkin)**
    *   Each bag is made by a single craftsman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.
    *   A single Kelly bag requires 36 unique pieces of high-quality leather, ideally from the same animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.
    *   It takes approximately 20 hours spread over several weeks to create one bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.
    *   Artisans undergo two years of training to become certified Hermès artisans, with several more years required before they are permitted to work on Birkin and Kelly bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>.

## Savoir-Faire and Training
Hermès refers to its accumulated knowledge and expertise as "savoir-faire," which is transmitted directly from one craftsperson to another across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This direct transmission of knowledge is critical to their ability to scale production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

To maintain their commitment to craftsmanship while expanding, Hermès has developed a unique scaling strategy by building training schools and centers across France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:23">[02:48:23]</a>. They strategically open these trade schools in rural areas with high unemployment, training individuals in a dying art form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:23">[02:48:23]</a>. These schools boast 100% graduation rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:40">[02:48:40]</a>. In 2021, they even launched their first official French government-sanctioned degree program, the "École Hermès des savoir-faire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:22">[02:49:22]</a>.

This approach has transformed their workforce: the average age of an Hermès artisan is 30 years old, and 80% are women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>.

## Scaling Artisanal Production
Hermès maintains that no single production site (atelier) houses more than 250 to 300 craftspeople, as they believe more than this number turns a workshop into a factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>. This strategy of scaling horizontally, by adding multiple small workshops rather than one large factory, is compared to a "cloud computing idea" or "AWS for craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:15">[02:50:15]</a>. Today, there are 31 Hermès ateliers across France, with two to four new ones added each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:03">[02:50:03]</a>.

This commitment to scaling "the old way" ensures that 76% of Hermès objects sold are manufactured in their own exclusive workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:40">[03:14:40]</a>.

## Durability and Repair
A key aspect of Hermès' value proposition is the longevity and repairability of its products. All Hermès items are designed to be repaired, even those that are 100 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. The company operates 15 dedicated repair shops worldwide, mending approximately 120,000 pieces annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>. This contrasts with modern consumption patterns where items are often discarded when broken.

## "Soul" in the Product
The concept of "soul" is central to Hermès' philosophy. As explained by a former Hermès artisan, a product made with bare hands possesses a soul, differentiating it from machine-made items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>. This emphasis on the human element in creation is a powerful differentiator in the luxury market.

## Challenges and Future of Craftsmanship
Despite its success, Hermès faces ongoing challenges related to its commitment to craftsmanship.
*   **Exotic Leathers:** The use of exotic leathers, such as crocodile skins, has drawn criticism regarding animal welfare. Hermès responds by stating they own their farms and release animals back into the wild as part of sustainable farming practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Imperfect Products:** Hermès destroys imperfect products to protect its brand image, which is viewed as wasteful given the animal resources involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. However, they are working on increasing manufacturing efficiency to reduce waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:56">[03:51:56]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Purity:** As the company grows, it faces the tension between remaining a "museum" (purely handcrafted) and serving its expanding client base. The Apple Watch partnership, for instance, introduced machine-sewn leather products at a lower price point, which some view as a "profanity" or a "mild violation of the brand promise" due to not being handmade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:27">[03:02:27]</a>.

The [[importance_of_focusing_on_product_development | importance of focusing on product development]] at Hermès is intertwined with its commitment to craft. Every new product or adaptation (like the smaller Kelly bag for cars or the Birkin for daily tote needs) must uphold the brand's quality and artisanal standards.

Hermès' strategy is a deliberate act of [[luxury_market_dynamics | counter-positioning]] in the luxury market. While other brands might chase volume or outsource production, Hermès doubles down on its unique, hand-crafted approach. This decision enables the brand to maintain high pricing, exclusivity, and a perception of unparalleled quality. The scarcity created by their production constraints, rather than being a drawback, becomes a key driver of demand and brand mystique within the [[luxury_market_dynamics | luxury market dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>.

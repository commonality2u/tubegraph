Howard Schultz is widely recognized as the effective founder of the [[Starbucks growth and expansion | Starbucks]] we know today, existing on nearly every corner of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>. He started working at the small chain of three Starbucks stores in 1982, eventually buying the company and becoming CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. Under his leadership, Starbucks transformed from a local bean seller into a global coffeehouse giant, known for its unique culture and pervasive presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

## Starbucks Pre-Schultz Era (Starbucks 1.0)

Starbucks was founded in 1971 in Seattle's Pike Place Market by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:42">[06:41:42]</a>. The founders were inspired by Peet's Coffee Company in the Bay Area, which was pioneered by Alfred Peet, who brought specialty Arabica coffee to Northern California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Initially, Starbucks only sold pounds of coffee beans and coffee-making equipment, not prepared beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. In the early 1980s, the coffee landscape in America was dominated by instant coffee brands like Folgers and Maxwell House, which primarily used low-grade Robusta beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. Starbucks was a pioneer, educating customers about the taste of good coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

Howard Schultz, then working for a Swedish housewares company called Hammerplast, first visited Starbucks in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. He was captivated by the romance and education surrounding coffee at the Pike Place Market store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. After establishing a vendor relationship, he joined Starbucks in 1982 as the head of marketing, when the company had only three stores and was about to open its fourth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. His ambition was to expand beyond Seattle, even considering Portland, Oregon a grand ambition at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. Schultz's background included a sales job at Xerox, where he learned humility and persistence through daily rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.

## The Epiphany and Il Giornale

In 1983, while on a business trip for Starbucks to a housewares conference in Milan, Italy, Howard Schultz had a transformative experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. He discovered the vibrant Italian coffee bar culture, where espresso was served, and cafes served as community gathering places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>. He raced back to Seattle, convinced that Starbucks needed to adopt this model and sell beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>. However, the Starbucks founders, Jerry Baldwin and Gordon Bowker, rejected his vision, stating they did not want to be in the "restaurant business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>.

After two years of persistence, they allowed him to open a small coffee bar section within the sixth Starbucks store in Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. The bar, where Schultz worked as a barista, quickly saw its customer count double due to the introduction of lattes and cappuccinos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>. Despite this success, the founders remained unconvinced, leading Schultz to leave Starbucks in frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>.

With financial backing from Starbucks itself and several investors, Schultz founded his own coffee bar company, Il Giornale, in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. He raised $1.6 to $1.7 million, talking to 242 investors, 217 of whom said no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:34:00">[39:34:00]</a>. Notably, two major Italian coffee companies, Faema and Lavazza, declined to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>. He faced personal hardship, working without a salary for two years while his pregnant wife Sherry worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>. Sherry's support was crucial, standing by his vision even when her father urged him to get a "real job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:00">[27:12:00]</a>.

Schultz emphasized the concept of the "third place" – a community hub between home and work – which he observed in Italy and saw emerging in his Il Giornale stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>. This focus on human connection was a key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.

## Acquisition of Starbucks

In 1987, the original Starbucks, after acquiring Peet's Coffee, found itself in financial trouble with a debt-to-equity ratio of over 6:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. Jerry Baldwin offered to sell Starbucks to Schultz for $3.8 million, allowing him 90 days to raise the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>.

Schultz faced a critical challenge when one of his existing investors, Sam Strum, attempted to make an all-cash offer to acquire Starbucks himself, which would have left Schultz out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>. Through a desperate plea to his friend Scott Greenberg, an attorney at the Gates firm, Schultz secured a meeting with Bill Gates Sr. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:23:00">[32:23:00]</a>. Bill Gates Sr., a revered figure in Seattle, confronted Strum directly, stating that Howard Schultz would acquire Starbucks, and Strum would "never hear from [him] again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>. Bill Gates Sr. then, along with his son, helped Schultz raise the remaining capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:14:00">[35:14:00]</a>. Notably, Bill Gates Sr. never publicly took credit for this crucial intervention, demonstrating remarkable humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:19:00">[37:19:00]</a>.

In August 1987, Il Giornale acquired the six Starbucks stores, along with three Il Giornale stores and two under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:38:00">[38:38:00]</a>. The combined company was rebranded as Starbucks Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>.

## Building the Starbucks Business Model

The new Starbucks focused on beverages, which offered an approximately 80% gross margin, significantly higher than selling beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47:00">[41:47:00]</a>. This allowed for a powerful economic model: a 2:1 sales-to-investment ratio in the first year and over 20% operating profit, leading to store payback within two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>. This was unheard of in the retail world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:40:00]</a>.

Key aspects of the [[Starbucks unique business model | Starbucks unique business model]] and customer experience:
*   **High Frequency and Affordable Luxury**: Customers often visited 18 times a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:50:00">[42:50:00]</a>. Coffee was seen as an affordable luxury, accessible to everyone regardless of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Customization**: Customers began customizing beverages early on, increasing average ticket size and enhancing loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>. This became a significant driver of the business, leading to an estimated 100,000 different beverage variations being made consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a>.
*   **Packaging Innovation**: Schultz discovered that standard Styrofoam cups tainted the taste of coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:11:00">[45:11:00]</a>. Starbucks then innovated by adopting a specific paper cup and a compatible sip-through lid, which later became a global standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:00">[45:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:30:00">[46:30:00]</a>.
*   **Unique Language**: Terry Heckler, the architect of the Starbucks name, helped develop the iconic sizing terminology (Short, Tall, Grande, Venti) to differentiate the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Customer Names on Cups**: This practice emerged organically as stores became busier, helping baristas manage orders and creating intimacy with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
*   **Experiential Brand with Zero Marketing Spend**: Starbucks became an "experiential brand at scale" without traditional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>. The iconic cup itself served as a "badge of honor" and a free billboard for the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>.

## Rapid Expansion and Leadership Team

Starbucks embarked on a rapid expansion phase, doubling its store count year over year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. Howard Schultz, with his vision and ambition, pushed for faster growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. He was joined by Howard Behar in 1989 and Orin Smith in 1990, forming the "H2O era" leadership team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Behar was the "soul" of the company, focusing on servant leadership and people-first values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. Smith was the "adult in the room," providing quiet wisdom and financial oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. The three often had dinner together every Monday night for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

The expansion strategy was deliberate, focusing on one market at a time before expanding further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. Chicago was the first market outside Seattle and Vancouver, and after initial struggles, Howard Behar helped recalibrate the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. Los Angeles was a significant point of contention due to its perceived unreadiness, but Schultz pushed for it, seeing the potential for brand equity through media and celebrity exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.

Starbucks also pursued strategic partnerships to boost brand awareness and distribution without direct marketing spend. These included:
*   **Costco**: Despite internal resistance, Schultz, influenced by [[Jeff Bezos transition from hedge fund to founding Amazon | Jeff Bezos's]] early investor Jeff Brotman and Costco founder Jim Sinegal, decided to sell Starbucks beans in Costco stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This significantly increased store volume and introduced thousands of new customers to Starbucks beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.
*   **United Airlines**: Another initially controversial move was to become the official coffee of United Airlines, providing broader exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   **Grocery Stores**: Selling Starbucks coffee in grocery stores further expanded brand reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.
*   **Barnes & Noble**: Partnerships with retailers like Barnes & Noble, which embraced the "third place" concept, created natural extensions of the Starbucks store experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.

## IPO and Public Company Life

Howard Schultz had always envisioned Starbucks as a public company, viewing it as a validation of the company and himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>. Starbucks went public in 1992, at a market capitalization of $250 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. At the time, there were zero publicly traded coffee companies, making investor education a key challenge during the roadshow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>. Schultz consistently fought the perception that Starbucks was merely a "restaurant," instead positioning it as a "hybrid retailer" or a "store" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.

## People-First Culture

A cornerstone of the [[Innovation and community at Starbucks | Innovation and community at Starbucks]] was its "performance-driven company through the lens of humanity" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:09">[01:47:09]</a>. Schultz's personal history of growing up poor and seeing his father disrespected heavily influenced this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>.

Key initiatives included:
*   **Bean Stock (1991)**: A year before the IPO, Starbucks offered stock options to every employee working 20+ hours a week, becoming "partners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>. This program, initially valued at $6 per share, grew 800x, providing significant wealth to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. All employee titles were put in lowercase as a sign of respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:41">[02:20:41]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Health Insurance (1988)**: Starbucks provided health benefits to part-time employees, including gay couples in domestic partnerships, years before the Affordable Care Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. This was driven by Schultz's childhood experience of his family lacking health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **College Achievement Plan (2014)**: Starbucks partnered with Arizona State University to offer four-year free college tuition to all partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:41">[02:52:41]</a>. Thousands of partners have since graduated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:03">[02:53:03]</a>.

These initiatives contributed to employee tenure being twice as long as the industry average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:19">[02:52:19]</a>.

## Global Expansion

Schultz pursued international expansion with caution, initially writing off Europe due to its established coffee culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:50">[02:29:50]</a>.

*   **Japan (1996)**: Japan became the first major international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:53">[02:29:53]</a>. Despite a consultant's report advising against it and concerns about Japanese culture regarding walking with coffee cups, Starbucks partnered with a local company founded by Yuji Son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:40">[02:31:40]</a>. The first store in Ginza had lines around the block on opening day, with customers ordering complex drinks like a "double tall latte," showing the brand's iconic reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:30">[02:32:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:32">[02:33:32]</a>. Starbucks now has 2,000 stores in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:51">[02:34:51]</a>.
*   **China (1999)**: Starbucks opened in Beijing, entering a tea-drinking culture with no established morning coffee business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Initial partnerships were unsuccessful, leading Starbucks to buy them out and operate independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The business struggled for a decade until Belinda Wong took over as the China CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Wong decentralized operations, allowing the China team to tailor offerings to local tastes, transforming the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. She even secured government approval to provide health insurance to partners' parents and grandparents, demonstrating the company's commitment to humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. China now accounts for 18% of Starbucks' revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:34">[03:17:34]</a>.
*   **Italy (2018)**: Despite the inspiration from Italy, Starbucks waited 50 years to enter the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:16">[03:19:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>. Schultz believed they had to "earn the right" to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Entry was spearheaded by the opening of a "Roastery," an immersive, Willy Wonka-inspired experience combining roasting and retail, designed to "blow people away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The first Roastery in Milan was secured through a direct appeal to Blackstone's John Gray, the landlord of the former post office building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Today, Starbucks has 30 traditional stores in Italy, with espresso being the number one beverage, indicating acceptance by Italians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## The Return as CEO (2008-2017 & 2022-2023)

Schultz stepped down as CEO in 2000, becoming executive chairman, feeling physically and emotionally exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:20">[02:41:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:51">[02:41:51]</a>. Orin Smith became CEO, followed by Jim Donald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

In 2008, amidst the global financial crisis and internal struggles (including a drop in same-store sales and market cap from $30 billion to under $7 billion), Schultz returned as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. He characterized the situation as an "existential crisis," with the company "seven months from being insolvent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Schultz closed 1,000 underperforming stores and made the difficult decision to lay off employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. He famously addressed 10,000 store managers in New Orleans, revealing the dire financial situation and appealing to their shared purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. He also temporarily closed all U.S. stores for a half-day to retrain baristas and re-emphasize coffee quality, which had been diluted by cost-cutting measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

During this period, Schultz had a candid conversation with Steve Jobs, who bluntly advised him to "fire everyone on your leadership team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Schultz's entire leadership team, except for the General Counsel, eventually turned over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

The turnaround was wildly successful, with profits increasing from $315 million in 2008 to $945 million by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Mobile Order & Pay: A Double-Edged Sword

Starbucks developed a mobile app, which launched its first version in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This platform, enabling mobile order and pay, became a significant pillar of the business, with 33% of orders currently placed through the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. It offered immense convenience and a powerful business model due to the "float" from gift cards (Starbucks holds $1.7 billion in unspent gift card balances, effectively an interest-free loan from customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

However, Schultz now views the mobile app as the "biggest Achilles heel" for Starbucks, as its seductive convenience has deteriorated the "third place" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. The company failed to anticipate the necessary technological refinements, leading to crowded stores and customer dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. He believes Starbucks "should not succumb to the mobile app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

### Second Interim CEO Tenure (2022-2023)

Schultz again served as interim CEO from 2022-2023 after Kevin Johnson's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. He found a lack of investment over the previous four to five years and disliked the use of stock buybacks to increase EPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. He immediately suspended stock buybacks and re-invested over $2 billion back into the partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

He acknowledged that the company made early mistakes during the tumultuous post-COVID era, particularly underestimating the groundswell of union sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. He defended the company against criticism, emphasizing that the focus should always be on the Starbucks partner in the green apron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

Schultz, who is no longer CEO or on the board, has publicly stated he has no desire to return to the CEO role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. However, he recently wrote a letter to current leadership offering "counsel and advice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. His recommendations included being more "coffee forward" and preventing the mobile app from eroding the in-store experience, reminding leadership that Starbucks is a "coffee company serving people," not a "beverage company serving coffee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## Starbucks Today

Today, Starbucks is a global institution:
*   **Revenue & Employees**: $36 billion in revenue, $4.1 billion in net income, and over 450,000 employees globally, having employed over 5 million people throughout its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Global Presence**: 39,000 stores in 86 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. About half are in North America, and 18% in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Operating Model**: Approximately half of stores are company-operated, and half are licensed or joint ventures with regional partners, ensuring cultural alignment rather than traditional franchising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   **Complexity**: Starbucks manages a complex business spanning agriculture (sourcing from 30 countries), manufacturing, retail, wholesale, and joint ventures with giants like Nestle and PepsiCo, all while focusing on its people-first mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Playbook: Why Starbucks Worked

The success of Starbucks can be attributed to several interconnected factors, creating a powerful "flywheel":
*   **Scaling Humanity**: The core of Starbucks' success lies in its obsessive focus on its people and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Initiatives like Bean Stock, health insurance, and free college tuition fostered loyalty and reduced turnover, allowing baristas to build genuine connections with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This focus on "compassion, empathy, and love" is seen as unique among large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Product as Experience**: Starbucks recognized that coffee was not merely a commodity but an opportunity for an elevated, personalized experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The craft and art of making coffee, combined with the intimacy between baristas and customers, transcended a mere transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Cash-Efficient Growth Model**: High gross margins on beverages and rapid store payback (within 1.5 to 2 years) provided significant capital for continuous expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. The gift card float further added to this capital efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Ubiquity as a Feature and a Challenge**: While ubiquity initially served as a free billboard and built brand awareness, it also posed a challenge, risking the commoditization of the experience and turning Starbucks into a "utility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **The "Third Place"**: The concept of a comfortable, welcoming environment between home and work resonated deeply with consumers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Market Creation**: Starbucks didn't just participate in a growing coffee market; it "created an industry that did not exist," expanding the overall demand for specialty coffee and inspiring countless followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   **Founder's Vision and Risk-Taking**: Howard Schultz's relentless ambition, willingness to take unconventional risks (e.g., launching Il Giornale, buying Starbucks, international expansion, rejecting franchising), and ability to rally people around a core purpose were critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. However, Schultz himself acknowledged that a founder's prolonged reliance can create an "unhealthy" organizational reliance, hindering internal innovation and succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

Despite recent [[Corporate governance and shareholder dynamics at Uber | challenges and strategies in Starbucks international expansion]], Starbucks remains a resilient institution, continuously striving to balance its global scale with its founding principles of humanity and an elevated customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

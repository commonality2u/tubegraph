The National Football League (NFL) stands as America's most favored sport, significantly more popular than basketball, its closest competitor, by more than three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The Super Bowl alone draws over 100 million viewers annually, captivating approximately two-thirds of American households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. In 2022, 82 of the top 100 TV broadcasts were NFL games, showcasing its unparalleled dominance in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The league's success is a testament to extraordinary cooperation, a belief in "growing the pie" over a century, and a unique blend of "communist capitalism at its finest," where owners have made bold, long-term bets by dividing revenues equally unlike any other sports league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Origins and Evolution of American Football

The game's roots trace back to November 6, 1869, at Rutgers University, where Princeton and Rutgers students played an early form of "mob football" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This medieval-style game, with no set rules beyond moving a ball to a target spot, had been played for centuries in England and was adapted by American college students aspiring to emulate the social elite of the "mother country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Early collegiate football, with 25 players per team, resembled soccer with a kick-only rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Despite its growing popularity as a character-building experience, early football was dangerously violent, leading to numerous serious injuries and even fatalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. In 1905, after 19 fatalities and an injury to Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of President Theodore Roosevelt, the President threatened to outlaw the game unless major safety changes were adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This intervention led to the creation of the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The NCAA introduced critical rule changes, including abolishing wedge formations and, most significantly, legalizing the forward pass in 1905, which fundamentally differentiated American football from rugby and soccer, adding a strategic and aesthetic dimension to the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### The Stigma of Professionalism

For decades, professional football was viewed as "immoral" and "dirty" by the elite, who saw it as profaning the esteemed amateur college game with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Unlike baseball, which had successfully established itself as a professional sport by the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, football struggled to gain legitimacy. Early professional teams were "barnstorming" groups with no organized schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Founding of the NFL (APFC)

In 1920, the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), soon to be renamed the National Football League (NFL), was founded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Spearheaded by George Halas, who coached the A.E. Staley starch company football team (the Staleys), the founders aimed to legitimize professional football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Their three-part plan included:
1.  **No current college players**: A strict separation between college and pro games, a rule that largely endures today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
2.  **High ethical and rules-based standards**: Unifying disparate rulebooks and customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
3.  **Jim Thorpe as president**: Leveraging the fame of Jim Thorpe, widely considered the greatest athlete of his time, to gain instant credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Thorpe, a Native American athlete, was a two-time Olympic gold medalist and had played professional baseball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

Despite these efforts, the NFL faced an uphill battle in the 1920s and 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. The stigma of professional football persisted, with critics like Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost arguing it "robs the Great American game of many of its greatest character building qualities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Most early teams were based in small towns and were financially unsustainable, leading many to fold or relocate to larger cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Only three original franchises—the Decatur Staleys (Chicago Bears), Racine Cardinals (Arizona Cardinals), and Green Bay Packers—endured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

Racial segregation also impacted the league. Initially integrated, the NFL, reportedly at the behest of George Preston Marshall, adopted a policy in the mid-1930s to exclude Black players, a ban that lasted until after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.

## Post-WWII Transformation and Competition

After World War II, a new middle class emerged in America, with disposable income and a growing desire for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. This coincided with the rapid expansion of television ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. The NFL, however, was initially resistant to expansion, remaining an eight-city league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

### The All-America Football Conference (AAFC) Challenge

This reluctance opened the door for competition. In 1944, the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) was founded, backed by prominent figures like Hollywood actor Don Ameche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. The AAFC's key asset was securing legendary Ohio State coach Paul Brown to lead their Cleveland franchise, the Cleveland Browns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Brown revolutionized football with a scientific approach, emphasizing play memorization, film review, and pioneering the use of full-time assistant coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. Crucially, the AAFC was integrated from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

The NFL's Cleveland Rams, facing direct competition from the popular Browns, were forced to move to Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. The LA Coliseum Commission mandated that segregated teams could not use the public stadium, forcing the Rams to integrate by signing Black player Kenny Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. This strategic move, aided by a savvy intern named Pete Rozelle, initiated the NFL's integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

The AAFC's existence, though short-lived (four years), forced the NFL to adopt crucial strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. New commissioner Bert Bell championed the "Any Given Sunday" philosophy: ensuring competitive balance so that "any team in the league should be able to beat any other team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. This was vital in an era where gate receipts were the primary revenue source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. Bell implemented a scheduling system that paired weaker teams against each other in the first half of the season to create more competitive games, and a reverse-order amateur draft to help struggling teams acquire top college talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>. This solidified the "league first, team second, players third" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

### The [[impact_of_television_on_the_nfl | Impact of Television]]

The 1950s saw an explosion in television ownership, from 7,000 sets sold in 1946 to 25 million homes with TVs by the early 50s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. While baseball owners initially resisted TV fearing cannibalization of gate sales, the NFL, as an underdog, was more willing to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. Early deals involved local blackouts for home games to protect ticket sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>. However, the success of nationally broadcast games, especially the 1958 NFL Championship ("The Greatest Game Ever Played") which garnered 45 million viewers, hinted at the immense potential of television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

## The AFL Challenge and the Rise of Pete Rozelle

Despite the growing TV success, NFL owners remained hesitant to expand, leading to a new challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>. In 1959, Lamar Hunt, a young heir to a Dallas oil fortune, after being repeatedly rebuffed by the NFL, founded the American Football League (AFL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. The AFL, with eight teams, notably included the Dallas Texans (now Kansas City Chiefs) and the New York Titans (now New York Jets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.

Crucially, Hunt applied an idea from baseball: a single, centrally negotiated national television contract with revenue shared equally among all teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. While major networks like CBS and NBC were uninterested, the upstart ABC, seeking compelling content, partnered with the AFL. Led by visionary executive Roone Arledge, ABC signed an unprecedented $8.5 million, five-year TV deal with the AFL before it had played a single game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.

This put the NFL in crisis, compounded by the sudden death of Commissioner Bert Bell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. After 11 days and 23 votes, the owners, unable to agree on a prominent candidate, chose 33-year-old Pete Rozelle, the Los Angeles Rams' general manager and former public relations intern, as the new commissioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>. Rozelle's youth and background in PR and West Coast media proved to be a stroke of luck for the league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

### Rozelle's Strategic Masterstrokes
Rozelle immediately implemented several transformative strategies:
*   **Expansion**: He ratified an expansion plan to directly compete with the AFL, notably launching the Dallas Cowboys in Lamar Hunt's backyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>.
*   **Headquarters Relocation**: He moved the league headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City, positioning the NFL next to the media, television, and [[nikes_business_and_marketing_strategy | advertising]] industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
*   **Professional Statistics**: He contracted the Elias Sports Bureau to provide professional game statistics, making it easier for newspapers to cover the league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   **Cultivating Media Relations**: He cultivated relationships with publications like Sports Illustrated, which became a major advocate for the NFL, leading to Rozelle being named Sportsman of the Year in 1963, the first non-athlete to receive the honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>. He even had NFL staff write stories for busy reporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>.
*   **Political Influence**: He cultivated relationships with political figures, notably the Kennedy family, setting the stage for future legislative support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>.

Recognizing the power of centralized TV contracts, Rozelle successfully persuaded NFL owners to pool their individual TV rights into a single league-wide deal with CBS in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. This $4.65 million per year deal, shared equally among teams, dwarfed the AFL's contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. When this collective bargaining was challenged as an antitrust violation, Rozelle leveraged his political connections, and President John F. Kennedy signed the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, granting the NFL a crucial antitrust exemption for league-wide media deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

### NFL Films and the Power of Storytelling

In 1962, Rozelle made another groundbreaking decision by partnering with Ed Sabol, a suburban dad with a passion for filmmaking, to produce the NFL Championship movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>. Sabol revolutionized sports video content, creating cinematic, high-quality films with slow motion, montages, and voice-overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>. In 1965, this venture became [[platform_business_models_and_strategy | NFL Films]], a core in-house division dedicated to creating compelling narratives and high-gloss content around the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>. NFL Films became the largest customer of Kodak film outside of the U.S. Army, meticulously archiving games from multiple angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>.

### [[Nikes_business_and_marketing_strategy | NFL Enterprises]] and the Flywheel

Rozelle also centralized merchandise sales, creating [[Nikes_business_and_marketing_strategy | NFL Enterprises]] to standardize and control branded products like jerseys and hats across the league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>. This, like TV revenue, was shared equally, demonstrating Rozelle's skill in persuading owners to sacrifice individual gains for collective prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

These initiatives formed the "flywheel" of the NFL's business strategy:
1.  **Raise League Stature and Product Sheen**: Through PR, media relations, and high-quality content.
2.  **Attract Fan Interest**: Deeper engagement and more viewers.
3.  **Increase TV Revenue**: Unconstrained by stadium capacity.
4.  **Equal Revenue Sharing**: Raises the level of play and competitive balance across all teams.
5.  **Improved Product**: Leading back to higher stature and more fan interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>.

This flywheel ultimately propelled the NFL to an $18 billion annual revenue business, with a collective team value of $140 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>.

### The Merger and the Super Bowl

The intensifying player acquisition war between the NFL and AFL, characterized by tactics like the NFL's "babysitting program" to prevent college stars from signing with AFL teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:39">[01:45:39]</a>, eventually led to merger negotiations. In a covert operation orchestrated by Rozelle and Dallas Cowboys GM Tex Schramm with AFL founder Lamar Hunt, a merger agreement was reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>. The negotiations were dramatically escalated by Al Davis, the new commissioner of the AFL and owner of the Raiders, who initiated an "all-out war" by poaching NFL players, including the Rams' star quarterback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>.

The merger, announced in June 1966, meant all AFL teams would join the NFL, with a combined season starting in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:10">[01:58:10]</a>. In the interim, a new "Pro Football World Championship game" would be held between the league winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:58">[01:58:58]</a>. This game, eventually dubbed the "Super Bowl" by Lamar Hunt (a name Rozelle initially disliked but stuck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:30">[02:12:30]</a>, was a masterful creation for television.

The first Super Bowl (1967) was broadcast on both CBS and NBC, with each network paying $1 million for rights and pledging another $1 million for promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:24">[02:08:24]</a>. It achieved an unprecedented 79% TV share and was watched by over 65 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:52">[02:08:52]</a>. Notably, while a TV sensation, the first Super Bowl was only two-thirds full at the LA Coliseum, signaling a shift in the primary value source from live gate to media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:41">[02:09:41]</a>. Rozelle intentionally cultivated "media week" and other pre-game events to generate hype and cater to media partners, ensuring the Super Bowl overshadowed the World Series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:28">[02:10:28]</a>. The AFL's upset victory in Super Bowl III (Jets vs. Colts), famously guaranteed by Joe Namath, cemented the event's drama and relevance, proving that competition benefited the league as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

The merger required another act of Congress for an antitrust exemption. This was secured through a quid pro quo orchestrated by Rozelle and House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, resulting in the creation of the New Orleans Saints franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>.

## Modern NFL Business and Challenges

By 1970, with the leagues fully combined, the NFL secured a four-year, $156 million TV contract, initiating the era of diversified media rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:20">[02:17:20]</a>. Rozelle's strategic genius led to the creation of Monday Night Football in 1970 with ABC, an $8.5 million per season deal for a single prime-time game, which became a weekly holiday watched by 60 million US households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:07">[02:24:07]</a>. Monday Night Football pioneered many broadcast innovations, including multiple camera angles, three-man commentary booths (Howard Cosell), parabolic microphones, split screens, and the invention of game highlights, which would later be bundled into ESPN's rights packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:06">[02:26:06]</a>.

### Financials and [[Platform Business Models and Strategy | Revenue Streams]]

The NFL's annual revenue currently stands at $18 billion, projected to grow to $25 billion by 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:20">[02:47:20]</a>. This includes:
*   **Media Rights (61%)**: Massive deals with CBS ($1.85B/year), Fox ($2B/year), NBC ($1.7B/year), Disney (ESPN, $2.55B/year for Monday Night Football), and Amazon ($1.3B/year for Thursday Night Football) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:43">[02:47:43]</a>. The NFL also resells content like Sunday Ticket, which is moving to YouTube TV, for $2 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:21">[02:48:21]</a>.
*   **Seating (20%)**: Including general and premium (luxury box) seating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:25">[02:54:25]</a>.
*   **Sponsorship and [[Impact of athlete endorsements and sponsorships | Advertising]] (10%)**: Leveraging strong brand partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:48">[02:54:48]</a>.
*   **Other (9%)**: Including [[Platform Business Models and Strategy | NFL Films]] and licensing deals (e.g., [[Sonys_Business_and_Market_Strategy | Madden]] NFL video game, valued at $1.6 billion over five years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>.

Approximately two-thirds of an NFL team's revenue comes from shared national sources, while the remaining third is local <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:06">[02:53:06]</a>. This local revenue disparity can be significant; the Dallas Cowboys, for example, made over $1 billion last year, compared to the Detroit Lions' $450 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:43">[02:53:43]</a>. The rising share of unshared local revenue (from 12% in 1994 to over 30% today) challenges the league's "league first" ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:03">[02:46:03]</a>.

### Player Compensation and Free Agency
The 1993 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) introduced free agency (for players with four years in the league) and a salary cap, tying player compensation to a fixed percentage (currently 48.8%) of the league's total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:05">[02:42:05]</a>. This structure makes players effective partners in the league's financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:54">[02:43:54]</a>.

### New Growth Engines: Fantasy Football and Sports Betting
The proliferation of fantasy football, played by 30-40 million Americans annually, has deeply embedded the NFL into social conversations and daily life, driving engagement and demand for platforms like NFL Sunday Ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:45">[02:50:45]</a>. The ongoing legalization of sports betting, with 46 million Americans betting on the NFL in 2022, represents another massive growth opportunity, as people are more likely to tune in when they have money riding on a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:22">[02:52:22]</a>.

## Challenges and Controversies

Despite its financial success, the NFL faces significant challenges:
*   **Player Safety and CTE**: The prevalence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) among former players, caused by repeated head trauma, has led to immense physical and mental harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:16">[02:55:16]</a>. The NFL settled a billion-dollar lawsuit and was accused of covering up research data for decades, only acknowledging the link in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:41">[02:56:41]</a>. This has created "cognitive dissonance" for fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> and led to declining youth football participation and concerns about long-term fan interest among younger generations (Gen Z's preference for the NFL is 10 points lower than the general adult population) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:02">[02:58:02]</a>.
*   **Social and Political Issues**: The NFL has struggled to manage social and political narratives, notably with Colin Kaepernick's kneeling protest against police brutality and racial inequality in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:49">[03:01:49]</a>. Kaepernick, a free agent after that season, was effectively blackballed by the league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:55">[03:05:55]</a>. This contrasts with the NBA's embrace of player voices on social media and highlights the NFL's struggle to control its narrative in the social media era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:33">[03:06:33]</a>.
*   **International Expansion**: The NFL has struggled to gain significant international traction, with initiatives like NFL Europe failing. This contrasts with the NBA, which sees international growth as crucial for its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:18">[03:10:18]</a>.
*   **Audience Stagnation**: Despite soaring media rights, the average viewership for NFL games has remained stagnant for the past two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:11">[03:16:11]</a>. The increased media rights value is attributed to the scarcity of live, mass-audience content, allowing the NFL to extract more profit from networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:02">[03:17:02]</a>.
*   **Taxpayer-Funded Stadiums**: Many NFL stadiums are largely funded by taxpayers, with little economic benefit for communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:01">[03:37:01]</a>.

## Analysis: Helmer's Seven Powers

Applying Hamilton Helmer's "Seven Powers" framework reveals the NFL's strategic strengths:
*   **Cornered Resource**: The NFL holds an almost complete monopoly on the best professional football talent globally. Its antitrust exemptions, granted by Congress, further solidify this position, preventing competing leagues from emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:30">[03:32:30]</a>.
*   **Counter-Positioning**: The NFL historically leveraged its willingness to embrace television (unlike baseball) and its "league-first" mentality (unlike the AAFC and individual teams) to outmaneuver competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:11">[03:33:11]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies**: The immense viewership allows the NFL to invest heavily in production values (e.g., Monday Night Football, [[Platform Business Models and Strategy | NFL Films]]), creating a superior entertainment product that a smaller league could not afford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:31">[03:35:31]</a>.
*   **Branding**: While not a traditional branding power (as there's no direct competitor offering a similar product), the NFL has cultivated a powerful cultural narrative and "sheen" through NFL Films and media relationships, making it a "made for TV" spectacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57">[02:59:57]</a>.
*   **Value Capture**: The NFL is exceptionally skilled at capturing value. It effectively resells its media rights multiple times (e.g., Sunday Ticket) and has outsourced the costly aspects of production and distribution to its broadcast partners, retaining the vast majority of the profit pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:09">[03:37:09]</a>.

While there are concerns about long-term trends like declining youth participation and changing generational preferences, the NFL's deep integration into American culture, its unique cornered resource of elite talent, and its strategic mastery of media rights position it for continued success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>.

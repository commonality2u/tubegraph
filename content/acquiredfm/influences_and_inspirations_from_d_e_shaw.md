After working for a startup developing network technology for high-speed trading applications, Jeff Bezos decided in 1988 that the customers of such technology, those involved in quantitative trading and finance, were making more money, leading him to transition into finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This early experience with networked computing provided him with a fundamental understanding of how it works and the practical implications of bandwidth and hardware capabilities, allowing him to perceive the types of applications that could be built using the infrastructure of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

In 1990, Jeff Bezos received a call from a headhunter that led him to interview at D. E. Shaw, a financial firm established a couple of years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Bezos unexpectedly "falls in love" with the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Founding of D. E. Shaw
The founder, David E. Shaw, earned a Stanford computer science Ph.D. in the 1980s and subsequently became a computer science professor at Columbia University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. His step-father was a finance professor at UCLA, sparking Shaw's interest in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. In 1986, he left Columbia to join Morgan Stanley, and in 1988, he founded D. E. Shaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

David Shaw's model for D. E. Shaw was inspired by Jim Simons, who started Renaissance Technologies (RenTech) in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. RenTech's core Medallion Fund, which now consists of private capital from its employees and Simons, reportedly averaged a 66.1% annual return from 1988 to 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This performance has been described as potentially the best by any investor of all time, even prompting a re-evaluation of [[entrepreneurial_lessons_from_warren_buffett_and_berkshire_hathaway | Berkshire Hathaway]]'s returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## D. E. Shaw's Identity and Culture
Although D. E. Shaw operated as a quant hedge fund, its founders resisted the idea that this sole function defined them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. They viewed themselves as a group of creative artisans who invested in and started businesses, generating new ideas and perceiving the world through diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This ethos contributed to Bezos's fondness for the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

The firm's recruiting philosophy focused on finding the "smartest people in the world" across all disciplines, even if they had no prior knowledge of business and finance, with the belief that the firm could find roles for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Jeff Bezos's Role and Relationships at D. E. Shaw
Jeff Bezos quickly ascended the ranks at D. E. Shaw, becoming the fourth senior vice president, a position just below David Shaw himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. At this point, he was in his mid to late twenties, considered a rising star within the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. He and David Shaw became very close, with Shaw likely serving as a mentor to Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

Bezos was involved in recruiting at D. E. Shaw, bringing in many highly intelligent individuals who would later become key early Amazon employees, including Jeff Holden and Nicholas Lovejoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Another notable recruit was Mackenzie Scott Tuttle, a Princeton graduate, whom Jeff Bezos married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Mackenzie Scott is considered to have been the first Amazon employee, actively working on accounting, legal, and operational setup before the first engineer was hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Innovative Projects and the Internet's Emergence
Within D. E. Shaw's entrepreneurial environment, David Shaw assigned Jeff Bezos to lead various projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. One of the first projects Bezos led was the development of the "third market" business, an initiative to create a separate market where retail investors could trade without incurring high brokerage commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This concept is seen as a predecessor to modern "dark pools" and "payment for order flow" mechanisms in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Concurrently, in the early 1990s (around 1992-1993), the internet was still in its nascent stages, characterized by technologies like Mosaic and Netscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Given their backgrounds, David Shaw and Jeff Bezos, who had used the internet in college when it was purely command-prompt based without a graphical user interface (GUI), were highly enthusiastic about its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. David Shaw reassigned Bezos to work with him on developing business plans to leverage internet opportunities within D. E. Shaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. One of their initial projects was an online retail brokerage for financial trading, similar to E-Trade, potentially evolving from the "third market" business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Influence on Amazon
The early years of Jeff Bezos, particularly his time at D. E. Shaw, are seen as crucial foundational experiences for Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. As Joy Cuffey, a former colleague, describes it, there's a "straight line" from Bezos's early life to his present-day self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Amazon is widely considered an extension of Jeff Bezos's vision, a company made in his image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. For its first decade, and arguably even longer, Amazon was essentially "Jeff Bezos at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

The experience at D. E. Shaw, specifically working on a financial newsletter idea with Halsey Minor (who later founded CNET), highlighted the concept of distributing the written word over the burgeoning World Wide Web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Bezos often chuckled at the irony that Amazon, a business leveraging new technology particularly good at distributing hypertext over a global network, chose to distribute books by printing words on paper and then shipping them, rather than putting the text directly into a browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Even today, the ability to search within books digitally is limited due to publishers' digital rights management (DRM) efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

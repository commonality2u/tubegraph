Oak Tree Capital is notably recognized for its focus on [[market_perception_of_risk_in_high_yield_bonds | distressed debt investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:49">[06:47:49]</a>.

## Origin and Strategy

This investment strategy was initiated in 1988 by Bruce Karsh and Howard Marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. The core idea involved purchasing the debt of companies that were bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

### Addressing Concerns

Initial skepticism arose, with people questioning the rationale of buying debt from bankrupt entities under the assumption that the debt would not be repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:02">[07:04:02]</a>. However, the strategy was premised on the understanding that while the debt might not be repaid in full, partial repayment could be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Alternatively, if creditors remained unpaid, they would acquire ownership of the company, which might hold significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

This approach was particularly well-suited for Howard Marks and Bruce Karsh's [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investment styles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. Howard Marks himself gravitated towards the bond department at his previous firm, noting it played to his quantitative skills and conservative personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Conversely, he noted that he would have been a "disaster" in venture capital, as he is not an optimist or a futurist and is "financially something of a chicken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of aligning an [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investment approach]] with one's personal strengths and temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

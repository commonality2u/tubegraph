The "Acquired Live at Chase Center" event was the result of a significant collaboration between the [[history_and_evolution_of_the_podcast_acquired | Acquired podcast]] and JP Morgan Payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Origin of the Event
The idea for the live show at the Chase Center emerged during a call between the [[history_and_evolution_of_the_podcast_acquired | Acquired]] team and JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. JP Morgan initially suggested a small event within a corner of the Chase Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, the hosts of [[history_and_evolution_of_the_podcast_acquired | Acquired]], simultaneously realized the potential of having access to the venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The JP Morgan Payments team then took the initiative, proposing a dedicated "Acquired Live at Chase Center" event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Strategic Partnership
The ability to host such a large-scale event was entirely dependent on effective partnering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. JP Morgan was considered an ideal partner because they were already listeners and deeply understood the show's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This mutual understanding ensured that collaborative ideas fit "like a glove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Event Preparation and Execution
Preparation for the event involved a "mad dash" to create an exceptional experience for thousands of attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Discussions included plans for a video featuring Jensen and considerations for the hosts' entrance on stage with Perkins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Visual Design
The [[behind_the_scenes_of_acquired_podcast | design]] approach for [[history_and_evolution_of_the_podcast_acquired | Acquired]] needed to evolve after seeing Don's artwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The collaboration with JP Morgan Payments was described as "special," witnessing the grand scale of everything from posters to stage art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The art created for the event covered the stadium inside and out, providing a "physical instantiation" of the [[acquired_stories_and_podcast_formats | Acquired brand]] that was previously unimaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The imagery aimed to be big, grandiose, and bright, with silhouettes of the hosts acting as a central theme from which other elements emanated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Guest and Talent
Key individuals were confirmed for the event, including Emily Chang, Daniel X, and Mike Taylor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Mike Taylor, a major recording artist with hundreds of millions of listens on Spotify, performed the [[acquired_stories_and_podcast_formats | Acquired]] theme song live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Unique Spectacle
The event was considered a significant spectacle, with the hosts noting that "Podcasts don't do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This non-traditional approach aligned with the [[acquired_podcast_format_and_content_strategy | Acquired podcast]]'s philosophy of covering companies that "don't follow the rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Pre-Show Activities
A tradition for Ben and David involves going for a run together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This tradition was shared with the audience by hosting a run with over 100 listeners before the live show, which also helped them manage their nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Post-Event Reflections
The event surpassed all expectations, with the hosts describing it as "beyond anything that we could have hoped or dreamed for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Partnership Success
The collaboration was hailed as a spectacular example of achieving something together that neither party could have accomplished alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. It was emphasized that no other partner in the world could have made the event happen besides JP Morgan Payments and [[history_and_evolution_of_the_podcast_acquired | Acquired]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The partnership was praised for its "level of taste," with JP Morgan Payments allowing [[history_and_evolution_of_the_podcast_acquired | Acquired]] to "just go be Acquired" while they supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The connection was also made between payments being a "centerpiece" of business building and JP Morgan's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Future Outlook
While the event was a huge success, there's a mixed mindset about what's next, with feelings ranging from "let's go big" to "never again," partly due to having young families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. There was also an element of surprise when the hosts jokingly mentioned "Welcome Jamie Diamond," the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, causing whispers and murmurs among the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The prospect of future events, perhaps in 2025, was mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

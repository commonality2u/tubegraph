The relationship between [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] and [[nvidia | Nvidia]] is a long-standing partnership crucial to both companies' success, particularly in the semiconductor industry.

## Genesis of the Partnership
The relationship between [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] and [[nvidia | Nvidia]] began with a letter from Jensen Huang, [[nvidia | Nvidia]]'s CEO, to Morris Chang, [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s founder, in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. [[nvidia | Nvidia]] was a small, four-year-old company facing potential bankruptcy with only about 50-60 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. They sought a foundry but had received no response from [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s San Jose office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Morris Chang, then head of [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]], was intrigued and "irritated a little bit" by this oversight, as he always instructed sales to engage with future customers, regardless of their size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

Morris Chang called Jensen Huang directly, who was in the midst of an argument with his team but immediately commanded "quiet" upon hearing Chang's voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. During their first meeting, Jensen Huang impressed Chang with his articulateness and optimism, despite [[nvidia | Nvidia]]'s financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. Huang boldly predicted that the chip they wanted [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] to fab would not only save [[nvidia | Nvidia]] but also make them a major [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] customer, generating at least $50 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This prediction came true; the successful games chip prevented [[nvidia | Nvidia]] from bankruptcy and within two to three years, they became one of [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s top five biggest customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:02]</a>.

## Challenges with 40nm Node and Morris Chang's Return
The partnership, which involves [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] manufacturing chips designed by [[nvidia | Nvidia]], has continued to immense scale, but faced challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. A significant issue arose in 2009 with the 40 nanometer node, where development was slower than [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] had hoped, costing customers like [[nvidia | Nvidia]] time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This problem occurred when Morris Chang had stepped down as CEO, retaining only the chairmanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

The issues were primarily manufacturing and quality problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. The previous CEO, relying on the quality director's assessment, insisted that [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] was not at fault and offered [[nvidia | Nvidia]] no compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. The 40 nanometer node yield problem, where a high percentage of chips could not be made to work, affected many customers, with [[nvidia | Nvidia]] being the biggest customer of that node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Due to these and other issues, Morris Chang decided to retake the CEO position in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

## Resolution and Strengthening the Partnership
Upon his return, one of Morris Chang's top priorities was resolving the ongoing dispute with [[nvidia | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. He called all major customers, including Jensen Huang, who seriously reminded him of the quality and manufacturing problems with the 40 nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. Chang promised a solution within a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.

Chang spent almost half his time in the first four to five weeks after returning as CEO focusing on resolving the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>. He familiarized himself with all aspects of the problem, including [[nvidia | Nvidia]]'s own customer demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>. About a month after retaking the CEO job, Chang emailed Jensen Huang, proposing a visit to Silicon Valley for dinner and a business discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>. Huang, anticipating the business discussion, promptly agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>.

At the meeting, after an hour and a half of non-business talk, Morris Chang presented an offer to [[nvidia | Nvidia]] on the order of over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a>. He stipulated that the offer was effective for 48 hours; otherwise, they would proceed to arbitration, a course [[nvidia | Nvidia]] had previously suggested to the former CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>. Jensen Huang accepted the offer within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>.

## Legacy of the Partnership
This resolution solidified a strong partnership that has since led to many billions of dollars of business between [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] and [[nvidia | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:00">[35:48:00]</a>. Morris Chang included this story in his autobiography, highlighting it as a great success in working out differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>. The ability to resolve such a significant dispute underscored the deep personal relationship between the leaders and the strategic importance of the partnership.

[[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s decision to maintain its older fabs for mature nodes ensures continued revenue streams from replacement parts and specialized applications like CMOS sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>. This contrasts with competitors like Intel, who repurpose old fabs for leading-edge technology, losing older manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>.

The company's strategy of being a "Pure Play Foundry" where it does not compete with its customers, like [[nvidia | Nvidia]], is a significant factor in its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This business model, combined with continuous high investment in R&D and capital expenditures, has enabled [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] to achieve market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>. The company's R&D budget was set at 8% of revenue, regardless of recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:26:00">[41:26:00]</a>. This consistent investment, coupled with aggressive capital spending, allowed them to take a leadership role, particularly from the 28 nanometer node onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:00">[42:49:00]</a>.

Morris Chang attributes [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s success to his early realization of the "fablous" model, which enabled companies to design chips without owning manufacturing facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:21">[02:16:21]</a>. He saw this future through interactions with people like Gordon Campbell and Don Valentine, founders of early fabless companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:49">[02:16:49]</a>. This foresight led to [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] building up capacity and capabilities to be ready when the fabless revolution gained momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>.

Morris Chang highlighted the importance of the [[tsmcs_business_strategy_and_learning_curve_pricing | learning curve theory]] in [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:59">[02:02:59]</a>. This theory, which posits that unit costs decrease as cumulative production volume increases, guides [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s pricing and investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>. The goal is to achieve the largest possible volume, thereby reducing costs and outcompeting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. This approach necessitates forecasting future market demand and making significant capital expenditures to rapidly scale production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

The rise of ARM architecture also played a crucial role in [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s success by creating an opportunity for a dedicated foundry for ARM chips, a market not dominated by x86 architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Many key companies in the semiconductor ecosystem, including ARM, Synopsis, Cadence, and ASML, were founded within a few years of [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] in the mid to late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:26">[02:27:26]</a>. This period, dubbed an "absolute golden period," fostered a highly integrated ecosystem, particularly visible in Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan, where [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s headquarters and many fabs are located alongside its partners and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

The scale of [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s operations is immense, with multi-billion dollar investments in new fabs and continuous R&D into next-generation process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>. This high capital and R&D expenditure contributes to [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]]'s natural monopoly characteristics, as few companies can deploy the necessary resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>.

The company's growth has coincided with the exponential growth of the global semiconductor market, which expanded from $26 billion in 1987 to $527 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. This "ridiculous Tailwind" has propelled [[tsmcs_founding_and_evolution | TSMC]] to become a trillion-dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

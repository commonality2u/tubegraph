From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Mark-to-market (MtM) accounting is an accounting method that values assets and liabilities based on their current market price, rather than their historical cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. This means that even if an asset has not yet been sold, its current market value is reflected on the balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. This method is commonly used by financial institutions and venture capital firms, which often mark their portfolios based on new funding rounds or market valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.

## Enron's Adoption of Mark-to-Market

Enron, originally a pipeline company, transitioned into an energy trading and financial derivatives firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>. A pivotal moment in Enron's history was the insistence of Jeff Skilling, a McKinsey consultant who would later become CEO, that the company adopt mark-to-market accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. Skilling saw this as a non-negotiable condition for him to join Enron, believing it was essential to build the business he envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

Traditional accounting for a gas delivery business recognizes revenue when gas is delivered and costs when incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>. However, Skilling wanted Enron to account for the market value of all bought and sold items, even if not yet transacted in cash, much like a stock trading firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.

Despite initial rejections from their auditors, Arthur Andersen, due to its unconventional nature for an operating oil and gas company, Skilling's persuasive arguments convinced the SEC to approve Enron's use of mark-to-market accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. Enron became the very first non-financial company to use this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

## The Misuse and Manipulation

The adoption of mark-to-market accounting opened up significant avenues for abuse at Enron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

### Inflated Revenue Recognition
Enron would enter into long-term contracts with energy producers to secure future production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>. Under MtM, they would immediately recognize the *projected* future cash flows from these 20-year contracts as revenue on their income statement, even if no cash had changed hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. This allowed them to inflate current reported profits based on highly optimistic, and often unrealistic, future projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.

### Special Purpose Entities (SPEs)
To hide debt and poor-performing assets, Enron used [[market_pricing_and_investment_pitfalls | Special Purpose Entities]] (SPEs), also known as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. These separate legal entities could be kept off Enron's consolidated accounting books if at least 3% of their capital came from outside investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.

Enron would "sell" its problematic assets or investments in producers to these SPEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. This "sale," often to an SPE that Enron largely controlled (owning 97% of the economics), was then booked as *additional* revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. This effectively allowed Enron to double-dip on revenue recognition: once from the initial projected cash flows, and again from the "sale" to the SPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. All of this occurred without actual cash changing hands for revenue recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.

## Consequences of Misuse

*   **Borrowing from the Future**: Enron's accounting essentially "borrowed from the future" by recognizing all potential upside from deals across 20 years, across different markets and geographies, as current revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. This meant they were constantly starting from zero each year, requiring an ever-increasing volume of new, larger deals to show continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Disconnect from Cash Flow**: Despite reporting high revenue growth and profits, Enron consistently had terrible free cash flow and low returns on invested capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:22">[01:54:22]</a>. The company often had to issue more equity to the public to fund its operations and investments, as its actual business wasn't generating sufficient cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. This created a "pump the stock" flywheel, where rising stock prices enabled more equity issuance, which in turn funded more dubious deals to inflate reported revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.
*   **The Unraveling**: The discrepancy between reported profits and actual cash flow eventually drew the attention of short sellers and journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:18">[01:55:18]</a>. When the tech bubble burst in 2000-2001, and the [[market_pricing_and_investment_pitfalls | tide went out in the market]], companies with inflated valuations and questionable accounting practices, like Enron, came under intense scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This mirrors the dynamics seen in other market downturns, such as the 2022 crypto market collapse, where speculative assets and opaque practices were exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a>.
*   **The Raptors**: A prime example of the extreme manipulation was Enron's use of "Raptor" entities (Raptor one, two, three, and four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:25">[02:18:25]</a>. These were off-balance sheet vehicles used to hide large losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:32">[02:18:32]</a>. They were intended as hedges, but the underlying collateral was often Enron stock itself, effectively doubling the company's exposure to market downturns and causing a massive toxic cascade when the stock price fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:02">[02:19:02]</a>.

## Regulatory Response: Sarbanes-Oxley Act

The Enron scandal, among others, directly led to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:02">[02:38:02]</a>. SOX introduced strict regulations to prevent similar corporate accounting frauds:
*   **CEO/CFO Certification**: Top management (CEO and CFO) must personally certify the accuracy of financial information, increasing accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:54">[02:38:54]</a>.
*   **Penalties for Fraud**: More severe penalties were introduced for fraud and the tampering with or destruction of evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:05">[02:39:05]</a>.
*   **Auditor Independence**: Accounting firms were required to spin off their consulting practices, ensuring auditors are more independent and reducing conflicts of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, was famously implicated in document destruction related to Enron's collapse, which contributed to its demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:20">[02:14:20]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Disclosures**: Public companies must now disclose all off-balance sheet entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:26">[02:39:26]</a>.

SOX significantly raised the cost and complexity of being a public company, which some argue contributed to the trend of companies staying private longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:51">[02:39:51]</a>. This has led to the observation that major frauds are now more likely to occur in the private market, as seen with companies like Theranos and in various [[the_role_and_impact_of_retail_stock_trading_and_gambling_in_the_investment_market | crypto scandals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:56">[02:39:56]</a>.

*   Modern AI tools such as ChatGPT, OpenAI's Sora, and Midjourney, which are all built on [[innovations_in_frontend_development_with_nextjs_and_vercel | Next.js]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### The Rise of Next.js and Cloud Rendering

Vercel's co-founder, Guillermo Rauch, identified a gap in web development where powerful [[open_source_technology_in_metas_growth | open-source]] tools like Kubernetes (from Google) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> and React (from Meta) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> were available but exceedingly difficult to configure and assemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This led to the creation of [[innovations_in_frontend_development_with_nextjs_and_vercel | Next.js]], a framework that automates the complex setup, bridging the gap between open-source technology and quick deployment of delightful experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

A key differentiator for Vercel and [[innovations_in_frontend_development_with_nextjs_and_vercel | Next.js]] was the focus on dynamic, cloud-rendered applications, contrasting with a community trend towards static applications and heavy client-side rendering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. By offloading rendering and computation to the cloud, Vercel ensures fast experiences, particularly important for mobile users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

> "If you rendered in the cloud, you were taking the burden of experiencing a website off of the device." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>

Today, [[innovations_in_frontend_development_with_nextjs_and_vercel | Next.js]] has 1.3 million monthly active developers and is considered the standard for building fast web applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Enhanced Developer Experience and Collaboration

Vercel's infrastructure significantly improves the developer workflow and collaboration:

*   **Automated Preview Deployments:** A "magical experience" for developers, where every Git branch is automatically deployed as a preview with a unique URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This eliminates the need for developers to spin up full environments or fight over staging machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. These preview environments are ephemeral and secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   **Faster Feedback Loops:** Vercel reduces deployment times from weeks (involving human conversations and manual processes) to seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This rapid feedback keeps developers in a state of "flow" and increases productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.
*   **Company-wide Collaboration:** Preview URLs allow everyone in an organization — not just developers — to participate in building software, providing feedback in real-time on any device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This transforms internal processes, replacing screen-sharing meetings with direct URL access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

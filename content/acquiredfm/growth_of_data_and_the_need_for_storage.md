Over the past decade, a recurring theme has been the understanding that not all software is created equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Database Market

Around 2000, the largest sector of software was databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. At that time, the aggregate total enterprise value of companies primarily deriving revenue from databases was approximately a trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Data Deluge

Currently, more data is being produced annually than in all preceding years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This ever-increasing volume of data necessitates a permanent storage location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, and the future will see even more sensors built to gather additional data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Future of Decision Making

Bill Gates once remarked on the "barbaric" way decisions are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He envisioned a future where all this stored data would be analyzed by machines to aid in making better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Examples of such machine-aided decisions include:
*   Diagnosing an illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Educating a dyslexic child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Maintaining an aircraft's engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

In this future, decisions will be made by machines that analyze data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Transformation of the Database Market

There has been a strong view that the [[the_transformation_of_the_database_market | entire database market]] would undergo a remake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This transformation is expected to occur [[cloud_infrastructure_and_enterprise_enablement | in the cloud]], with new solutions purpose-built for the cloud environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. A significant focus has been placed on the [[cloud_infrastructure_and_enterprise_enablement | infrastructure layer in the cloud]] and the necessary [[cloud_infrastructure_and_enterprise_enablement | enablement]] to facilitate enterprises moving to the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This area has proven to be a rich vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Costco is admired for its unique [[costcos_business_model_and_growth | business model]] and deeply ingrained philosophy of providing extreme value to its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. This approach is meticulously woven into its pricing strategy and its relationships with suppliers, fostering long-term trust and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:44">[02:12:44]</a>.

## Pricing Strategy: Prioritizing Customer Value

Costco's pricing strategy is centered on providing the "best possible value to customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:21">[02:22:21]</a>. A core tenet of this strategy, inherited from founder Saul Price's "fedmart" days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>, is a strict cap on product markups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:31">[02:27:31]</a>.

### Strict Margin Caps
Costco internally mandates that they are not allowed to mark up any product more than 14% above the price they pay suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:31">[02:27:31]</a>. For certain categories, like electronics, this cap is even lower, at 6-8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>. The only exception is its private label, [[costcos_business_model_and_growth | Kirkland Signature]], which has a slightly higher cap of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:26">[02:30:26]</a>.

This contrasts sharply with other retailers:
*   Department stores commonly use a 100% markup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:15">[02:31:15]</a>.
*   Even discount retailers like [[walmarts_technology_adoption_and_ecommerce_strategy | Walmart]] typically mark up products by 25%, almost twice Costco's general margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:25">[02:32:25]</a>.

The philosophy behind this is captured by former CEO Jim Sinegal, who stated that raising prices is "like heroin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:42">[02:33:42]</a>. He emphasizes that while a small price increase might significantly boost pre-tax income, it betrays the fundamental commitment to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:02">[02:34:02]</a>. This dedication to low prices builds immense [[the_role_of_memberships_and_consumer_value_at_costco | member trust]] and loyalty, ensuring customers feel they are always getting the "absolute best price on everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:55">[02:39:55]</a>.

### Limited "Loss Leaders"
Unlike many retailers that rely on "loss leaders" (selling items below cost to attract customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:02">[02:50:02]</a>, Costco generally avoids this practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:22">[02:50:22]</a>. The famous exception is the $1.50 hot dog and soda combo, which has remained the same price for 47 years and is likely the only loss leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:30">[01:53:30]</a>. This consistency reinforces the promise of value.

## Supplier Relationships: Tough but Fair
Costco's approach to its suppliers is characterized as "tough but fair," built on a foundation of mutual respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a>.

### The "Respect Our Suppliers" Principle
The Costco Code of Ethics, largely inspired by Saul Price's early principles, includes "respect our suppliers" as its fourth priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:05">[02:26:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:59">[02:28:59]</a>. This means that while Costco demands the lowest possible prices, it does so transparently and with an understanding of the supplier's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:23">[02:25:23]</a>.

Costco buyers are notoriously knowledgeable about commodity prices and supply chain dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:41">[02:26:41]</a>. If a supplier attempts to increase prices, the Costco buyer will inquire why, often referencing specific market rates for raw materials like cocoa, milk, or sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:51">[02:26:51]</a>. They track these factors and will call back suppliers if commodity prices drop to ensure the savings are passed on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:34">[02:27:34]</a>.

### Leverage from Low SKU Count
A critical factor in Costco's leverage with suppliers is its incredibly low SKU (stock keeping unit) count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. While a [[walmarts_technology_adoption and ecommerce strategy | Walmart]] Supercenter might carry 100,000 to 150,000 different SKUs, Costco typically stocks around 3,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This focus means that for any given product category, Costco sells an enormous volume of a select few items. The average revenue per product at Costco is about 10 times that of [[walmarts_technology_adoption_and_ecommerce_strategy | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">[02:30:28]</a>.

This lopsided relationship means Costco is often the largest customer for many of its suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:20">[02:30:20]</a>. Suppliers are willing to offer the absolute lowest prices to Costco because of the massive, consistent volume they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:39">[02:10:39]</a>. This allows Costco to share those "scale economies with customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:30">[02:11:30]</a>.

### Unique SKUs and "Walled Garden"
Costco often mandates that the items suppliers sell them are unique SKUs not available elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:05">[02:26:05]</a>. For example, a blender sold at Costco might come with extra cups, or a Sonicare toothbrush with additional heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:16">[02:26:16]</a>. This creates a "walled garden" effect, preventing direct comparison shopping and reinforcing the idea that Costco offers a unique, curated deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:13">[02:25:13]</a>. Even brands like Nike, highly conscious of their brand image, are sometimes willing to sell through Costco to clear inventory because of this unique environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:32">[02:26:32]</a>.

### Strategic Vertical Integration
Costco is primarily a merchant, but it will engage in vertical integration when it identifies opportunities to provide significantly more value to members by controlling the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:59">[02:27:59]</a>.

*   **Chickens**: Facing artificial price inflation from a concentrated chicken processing industry, Costco built its own fully owned chicken processing facility in Nebraska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:49">[02:28:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:30">[02:29:30]</a>. This facility, along with two other dedicated ones, processes 200 million chickens a year, allowing Costco to keep prices low for its famous rotisserie chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:54">[02:29:54]</a>.
*   **Optical Labs**: Similarly, observing artificially high prices in the eyewear industry, Costco now owns and operates three optical grinding labs to produce prescription eyeglasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:46">[02:52:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:02">[02:53:02]</a>.
*   **Other Products**: This strategy also extends to other [[costcos_business_model_and_growth | Kirkland Signature]] products like mixed nuts and coffee, where they work directly with farmers to improve product quality and reduce prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:20">[02:30:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:50">[02:30:50]</a>.

## Interconnectedness and Results
Costco's pricing and supplier strategies are deeply intertwined with its overall [[costcos_business_model_and_growth | business model]]:
*   **[[the_role_of_memberships_and_consumer_value_at_costco | Membership Model]]**: The annual membership fee provides a stable, high-margin revenue stream, allowing Costco to operate its retail business on razor-thin margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. This financial stability enables them to commit to consistently low retail prices.
*   **Negative Cash Conversion Cycle**: By maintaining low SKU counts and efficient cross-docking distribution centers (92% of merchandise is cross-docked compared to [[walmarts_technology_adoption_and_ecommerce_strategy | Walmart]]'s 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:30">[01:47:30]</a>, Costco sells inventory faster than it has to pay its suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This means suppliers effectively finance Costco's inventory, freeing up capital for growth and further investments in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.
*   **Efficiency and Culture**: The focus on low overhead, high employee wages (leading to low turnover and shrinkage), and a culture where "every cent matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:36">[02:31:36]</a>, all contribute to their ability to offer unparalleled value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:06">[02:36:06]</a>.

This disciplined approach has allowed Costco to become a global retail giant, consistently growing revenue by about 10% for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The deliberate choice to reinvest cost savings and supplier benefits directly back into customer value has created a highly durable and defensible [[analysis_of_successful_companies and business_models_like_costco | business model]] that competitors find nearly impossible to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:51">[02:20:51]</a>.

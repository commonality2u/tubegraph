Linkabit, founded by Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi, played a pivotal role in the early development of secure communication systems, including those for pay television, before its acquisition led to the [[founding_and_significance_of_linkabit_and_qualcomm | formation of Qualcomm]].

## Pioneering Video Scrambling for Pay TV

Initially involved in two-way communications, including work with [[historical_collaborations_with_walmart_satellite_network | Walmart]], Linkabit developed a video scrambling system for pay TV on cable systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Before Linkabit's solution for multiple access cable systems, individuals with even mild technical knowledge could easily obtain early pay TV channels like HBO for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This reliance on "security by obscurity" meant that consumers could gain free access by simply unscrewing their cable boxes and moving a wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Jacobs, Viterbi, and the Linkabit team successfully solved this security vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Their system was adopted by HBO and subsequently by other major pay TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It is even suggested that this scrambling technology inspired the iconic HBO opener, featuring the de-scrambling process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Acquisition and Growth

In 1980, Linkabit was acquired by M/A-Com (formerly Macom), an East Coast radio technology company, for $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. At the time of acquisition, Linkabit already had a significant number of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Under M/A-Com, the company continued to grow, eventually reaching 1,500 employees over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Linkabit's technology was widely adopted by other retailers for satellite networks and by more cable TV channels, indicating it was a substantial business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Departure and the Genesis of Qualcomm

Despite the company's success and growth, Jacobs and Viterbi remained with M/A-Com for five years post-acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, a leadership change at the East Coast-based M/A-Com prompted them and five other key Linkabit engineers to leave in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Recognizing the nascent and rapidly evolving wireless communications industry, particularly the cellular telephone sector which was still in its analog (1G) phase, they saw a massive opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Early cellular technology, primarily car phones, was expensive and power-intensive, but consumer demand was immense, with years-long waitlists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Believing they could introduce digital, more efficient communication methods, Jacobs and Viterbi, along with five other engineers, founded Qualcomm in July 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The name "Qualcomm" is short for "Quality Communications," reflecting their ambition to bring high-quality communications to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Qualcomm's initial strategy mirrored Linkabit's, starting with consulting work, notably for Hughes on a proposal for a mobile satellite network for the FCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This work led to the development of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), an application of spread spectrum technology that allowed multiple conversations to share the same communication channels efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The CDMA method, applied to terrestrial cellular networks, was patented in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, becoming one of the most valuable patents in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. This strategic move, born from Linkabit's legacy, positioned Qualcomm to revolutionize the cellular industry by enabling far greater capacity and efficiency compared to existing Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

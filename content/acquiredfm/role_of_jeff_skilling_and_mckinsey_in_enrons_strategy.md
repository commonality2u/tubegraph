The early strategic direction of the company that would become [[enrons_rise_and_fall | Enron]] was shaped by the ambitious vision of its eventual CEO, Kenneth Lay, and the analytical prowess of McKinsey & Company's rising star, Jeffrey Skilling. Their convergence occurred during a pivotal moment in the energy industry, marked by deregulation and a shift towards market-based approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Kenneth Lay's Formative Years and Vision

Born in rural Missouri in 1942, Kenneth Lay experienced poverty but benefited from his family's belief in education, which led them to move to Columbia, Missouri, so his older sister could attend the University of Missouri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Lay followed, developing a lifelong passion for economics, where he excelled as a star student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

After graduating, Lay worked in the oil industry and completed a PhD in economics in his spare time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. In the mid-1970s, he was called to Washington D.C. by his former professor, who had been nominated to the Federal Power Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Lay served as the Deputy Under Secretary of Energy in the Department of the Interior during a period of oil shocks and burgeoning deregulation talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He later returned to industry, becoming president and number two operator at Florida Gas, a pipeline company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Pioneering Energy Markets

In 1982, Lay joined Transco Energy in Houston, Texas, a major hub for the oil and gas sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This period coincided with two significant developments: the full swing of energy deregulation and, surprisingly, a fall in energy prices for the first time in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transco found itself in a precarious position with contracts to buy assets at increasing prices while market prices were falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Leveraging his economic expertise, Lay conceived of a groundbreaking idea:
> "What if we set up a trading market for this oil and gas that we're contracted to buy... rather than us as the pipeline company buying all of this gas from the producers, we'll just operate the pipelines in the middle and we'll make this market and we'll let the end consumers of the gas... trade with the producers and we can create a spot market for energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

This concept, a departure from the traditional long-term contracts, was a massive innovation, effectively pioneering the financialization of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. While not yet securitization, it established a real-time spot market for energy exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Lay's unique blend of industry experience, economic training, and government exposure made him the perfect person to introduce this "opening of the floodgates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## The InterNorth-HNG Merger and Cultural Clash

In June 1984, Lay was recruited as CEO of Houston Natural Gas (HNG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The following year, InterNorth, the largest pipeline company in America based in Omaha, Nebraska, approached HNG for a merger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. InterNorth, facing pursuit from corporate raider Irwin Jacobs, sought the merger with HNG as a "poison pill" to become too large to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

InterNorth acquired HNG for $2.3 billion, a 40% premium to HNG's stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Despite InterNorth being the larger company, it quickly became evident that Lay and the HNG team would be running the show, leading to a significant culture clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. A key point of contention was the location of the new company's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The Omaha-based InterNorth board members, many with political connections, wanted to keep the headquarters in Omaha, while Lay was determined to stay in Houston, the heart of the energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Jeffrey Skilling and McKinsey's Entry

To resolve the headquarters dispute and justify their decision to the board, the management team hired McKinsey & Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The assignment landed on the desk of Jeffrey Skilling, a "young hot shot superstar Junior partner" at McKinsey's Houston office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Skilling had a notable reputation, including a famous anecdote from his Harvard Business School interview where he responded to a question about his intelligence with "I'm effing smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### The Fateful Meeting

Skilling traveled to Omaha to present his findings to the board, which clearly indicated Houston as the optimal location for the company's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. As he waited to present, the prior CEO of the combined entity exited, informing Skilling he had just been fired, and Lay had engineered a coup to become the new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

Due to the internal upheaval, the headquarters discussion was sidelined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Lay, ever the diplomat, knew not to press his luck with his new board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. However, this meeting marked the first encounter between Skilling and Lay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Lay apologized for the drama and expressed admiration for Skilling's work, asking him to continue as their McKinsey partner in Houston to lead future strategic initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

### The Strategic Importance of Natural Gas

At this time, natural gas was gaining strategic importance. It was perceived as a "pseudo clean energy" and a "next great Frontier," contrasting with the "dirty big oil and coal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This perception was partly due to its environmental benefits over oil, but significantly, because it was the first segment of the energy industry to be sufficiently deregulated for innovative market practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Furthermore, natural gas offered energy independence from foreign oil, a highly valued attribute in America, especially after the 1970s oil embargoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Its transportability via pipelines and ease of storage also made it an ideal asset for a free-market enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

The collaboration between Lay, with his vision for energy trading, and Skilling, with his sharp analytical mind and consulting background, laid the groundwork for the future strategies of the company that would become [[the_formation_and_impact_of_enron | Enron]].

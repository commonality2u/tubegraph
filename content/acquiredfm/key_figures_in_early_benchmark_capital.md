The genesis of Benchmark Capital emerged from a period of significant internal dissent within established [[silicon_valley_venture_capital_history | Silicon Valley venture firms]] in the mid-1990s, particularly concerning the distribution of rewards among partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A 1995 *New York Times* article highlighted the "resentment...among the younger partners" of venerated firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Robert Cagle: The Driving Force

Robert "Bob" Cagle, a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI), was a central figure in this movement, advocating for a new model of partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Cagle's background significantly shaped his views: he grew up in Flint, Michigan, with a single mother and a family working on General Motors production lines during hard times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. As the first in his family to attend college, he went to General Motors University, a vocational-style training school, before eventually getting the chance to attend Stanford Business School (GSB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

At GSB, Cagle met Dave Marquardt, who later invited him to join TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. At TVI, Cagle performed well, contributing to successful investments in companies like Synopsys and Avant! <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. However, after 10 years, he felt that senior partners were "holding on to the keys to the firm and all the economics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Cagle developed an "almost religious fervor" for the idea that "anything other than an equal partnership was just like morally wrong for a venture capital firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. His motivation stemmed from a deep "sense of fairness" and the belief in "proper rewards for proper work," alongside economic considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This conviction would become a cornerstone of [[venture_capital_firm_benchmarks_unique_partnership_model | Benchmark Capital's unique partnership model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Dave Marquardt: Mentor and Influence

Dave Marquardt, a few years Cagle's senior from GSB, played a significant role in Cagle's early career at TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Marquardt was instrumental in the firm's successful Microsoft investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. His investment philosophy, though predating Benchmark's formation, contained seeds of what would become the firm's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Marquardt believed that "The venture business is an intensely personal relationship business and it's not an industry that scales well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. He emphasized that venture capitalists should not offer "value-added service" but rather support founders, as "the CEO ultimately is responsible and accountable for everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This hands-off yet supportive approach was a precursor to Benchmark's own [[history_and_strategy_of_benchmark_capital | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

After TVI's dissolution, Marquardt went on to found August Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## The Formation of Benchmark Capital

Unable to achieve an equal partnership model at TVI, Bob Cagle decided to leave the firm around early 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. He approached Bruce Dunleavy, a friend from GSB who had interned for him at Boston Consulting Group, with the idea of starting a new firm based on the equal partnership principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Dunleavy, with a background in the PC industry and Goldman Sachs, was a rising "Young Turk" at Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. He had notable investments like Palm Pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Initially, Dunleavy hesitated due to financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. However, a few months later, internal discussions at Merrill Pickard also revolved around the concept of equal economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Bruce Dunleavy and fellow young partner Andy Ratcliffe advocated for this idea, but it was not embraced by the senior partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This push from Cagle and Dunleavy, stemming from their belief in fairness and equity, became central to the [[founding_story_of_benchmark_capital | founding story of Benchmark Capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Dunleavy and Ratcliffe decided to join Cagle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Cagle's willingness to ask his former subordinate, Bruce, to be an equal partner demonstrated his "incredible amount of maturity" and "obsessive sense of fairness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

With three partners, Dunleavy convinced Cagle they needed more investment capacity and diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. He suggested bringing in entrepreneurial DNA, leading to the recruitment of Kevin Harvey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Harvey had started two companies, one acquired by Apple and another, Approach Software, in which Bruce had invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

The initial four — Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, and Kevin Harvey — formed the core of Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Believing they needed at least five people for a viable firm, they recruited Val Vaden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Vaden, also a GSB alumnus, had experience in software company buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

By the end of 1994, these five individuals — Bob, Bruce, Andy, Kevin, and Val — were the founding members of Benchmark Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. The audacious name, "Benchmark Capital," was chosen to signal their aspiration to "set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry and how venture capital is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

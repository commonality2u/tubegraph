Qualcomm's business model relies heavily on its extensive patent portfolio and a strategic approach to licensing its technologies. This has led to both immense financial success and significant legal battles.

## Core Business Model and Patent Leverage
By the end of 1999, Qualcomm had streamlined its operations to focus on two main business units: [[Qualcomms financial performance during the dotcom bubble | Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Group (QTC)]], which sold chips, and [[Qualcomms financial performance during the dotcom bubble | Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)]], which managed its patent licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This model allowed Qualcomm to earn high-margin revenue from licenses to its patent "war chest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

Qualcomm's licensing strategy was particularly aggressive, demanding 5% of the total phone sale price from manufacturers using their designs, rather than a flat fee per chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. When challenged about this model, Qualcomm's stance was often: "Where are you gonna go? We own all the patents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. They also insisted on separate licensing fees for their patents in addition to chip sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Expansion of Patent Portfolio: 4G and Beyond
In 2005, [[Qualcomms business transformation in the 1990s | Qualcomm]] acquired Flarian Technologies for $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. This acquisition was primarily to gain crucial patents for the emerging 4G technology, which was based on OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) rather than CDMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

One industry analyst described the Flarian acquisition as a move "to refill the pot of missiles that Qualcomm promises not to fire at their customers if they pay additional money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. This acquisition allowed [[Qualcomms future direction and challenges | Qualcomm]] to maintain its licensing business model for 4G and LTE, as they owned many of the necessary patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

## Legal Challenges and Public Perception Shift
While [[Qualcomms history and evolution | Qualcomm]] is recognized as a pioneer and inventor in technology, heavily reinvesting revenue into research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>, their aggressive patent and licensing strategies led to significant legal challenges.

Litigation against [[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm]] began to escalate around 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. The company's image shifted from technological innovator to "value capture pioneers" and being perceived as "maximally extractive over their ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. Legal actions from entities like Apple and the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for antitrust behavior, highlighted these ongoing disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

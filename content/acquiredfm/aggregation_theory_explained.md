Aggregation Theory is a business framework that describes the dynamics of internet platforms and their competitive advantages. It posits that the internet, contrary to early beliefs, inherently centralizes power, leading to dominant companies that aggregate users and supply, commoditizing suppliers [00:02:21]. This theory is considered a modern equivalent to frameworks like Porter's Five Forces [00:01:30].

## Origins and Core Tenets

The ideas underpinning [[impact_of_aggregation_theory_on_business_strategy|Aggregation Theory]] were developed and written about starting in 2013, prior to the official coining of the term [00:01:52], [00:06:51]. At that time, many believed the internet would lead to decentralization, Apple was seen as doomed, and [[evolution_of_facebook_and_meta|Facebook]]'s IPO was considered a disaster [00:01:57].

The foundational "takes" that informed [[impact_of_aggregation_theory_on_business_strategy|Aggregation Theory]] included:
*   Apple was not doomed and would perform well [00:02:16].
*   The internet was centralizing, not decentralizing, contrary to popular understanding [00:02:21].
*   Microsoft had a clear path forward and was not doomed to irrelevance [00:02:33].
*   [[evolution_of_facebook_and_meta|Facebook]] was far more dominant and valuable than people thought [00:02:38].

These insights, initially controversial, have largely become accepted truths due in part to the work articulating [[impact_of_aggregation_theory_on_business_strategy|Aggregation Theory]] [00:02:27], [00:02:56]. The theory provides an "edge" in understanding market dynamics, typically months or a couple of years before they become common knowledge [00:03:09].

The term "[[impact_of_aggregation_theory_on_business_strategy|Aggregation Theory]]" itself was coined later to give the concept a clear identity, inspired by Clay Christensen's "Disruption Theory" [00:07:01], [00:09:02]. Earlier writings, such as "Economic Power in the Age of Abundance" (2014), articulated similar ideas but lacked a memorable name and were less widely read [00:07:08], [00:07:20]. Giving the theory a specific term was crucial for its widespread recognition and adoption [00:07:01], [00:09:34].

## Evolution and Challenges of Canonical Work

While there is a strong argument for [[impact_of_aggregation_theory_on_business_strategy|Aggregation Theory]] to be presented in a canonical form, such as a book, there are several reasons why this has not happened:
*   **Logistical and Financial Incentives**: Continuous daily writing is significantly more profitable than writing a single book [00:03:30].
*   **Productivity and Deadlines**: Daily deadlines provide the necessary spur for productivity, and the absence of such structure for a book is a significant "fear factor" [00:03:39].
*   **Dynamic Nature of the Internet**: A book, being "frozen in time," struggles to keep up with the rapid changes in technology and business [00:03:52]. For instance, an [[impact_of_aggregation_theory_on_business_strategy|Aggregation Theory]] book written a few years prior might have incorrectly centered on Netflix, failing to foresee the importance of content ownership in breaking away from aggregators [00:03:58]. The iterative nature of online writing allows for corrections and updates when initial hypotheses prove wrong [00:04:20].
*   **Transience of the Internet**: The internet's nature is transient, not permanent [00:04:40]. This aligns with a continuously updated body of work rather than a fixed publication. An example of this transience is the suggestion that Twitter should have had disappearing tweets from its inception, aligning with its "in-the-moment" product experience and preventing the fear induced by permanent archives [00:04:50].
*   **Communication Style**: Effectively communicating complex ideas often requires meeting the audience where they are, step-by-step, rather than presenting a fully formed, advanced concept too early [00:08:01]. Current events provide a better vehicle for explaining and spreading these ideas, even if it means linking insights to specific, eventually forgotten, events [00:08:26].

Despite these challenges, there's an acknowledgment that a "set in stone" treatise would be beneficial for sharing and pointing people to a definitive explanation of [[impact_of_aggregation_theory_on_business_strategy|Aggregation Theory]] [00:05:51], [00:06:00].

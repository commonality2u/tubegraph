Mars, Incorporated is a privately owned global company known for its confectionery, pet care, and food products. The company's [[business_strategies_and_history | history]] is described as thrilling, featuring World War I, World War II, new technologies, inventions, and intense family drama [02:15]. Mars' corporate strategy has been as clever as that of companies like LVMH, [[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Walmart]], and Costco, enabling the Mars family to become one of the wealthiest in America [02:27].

Despite being widely known for its candy, Mars owns a diverse portfolio of products, including Snickers, M&M's, Pet Food, Ben's Original Rice, and Kind bars [02:56]. In 2023, Mars crossed $50 billion in sales, making it one of the top five largest private companies in America and doing more revenue than the Coca-Cola Company [03:20].

## The Founding Years: Frank C. Mars

The story of Mars begins in September 1883 with the birth of Frank Clarence Mars [05:08]. Frank's father was a flour grist mill operator, and his mother, Elva, was a housewife [06:18]. Frank contracted polio at a young age, affecting his legs and requiring him to wear orthopedic braces, which meant he spent a lot of time indoors with his mother [06:27]. Together, they engaged in baking, including making candy [07:00].

At this time, candy was primarily unbranded penny candy—gumdrops and licorice—sold wholesale by regional bakers to local retailers and drugstores, targeting children [07:24]. Chocolate was not yet a significant product in America [07:17].

By high school, Frank was known as the local candy chef [08:20]. In 1902, at 19, he established his own candy company in Minneapolis, selling his creations and others' wholesale [08:35]. In the same year, he briefly married Ethel Kissack, with whom he had a son, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] [08:50].

Frank's initial candy business faced challenges, primarily due to the highly perishable nature of penny candy and the lack of air conditioning, leading to inventory problems [10:44]. In 1910, Frank went bankrupt, and Ethel divorced him, sending [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] (then six years old) to live with her parents in Saskatchewan, Canada, because Frank was failing to make child support payments [11:09].

Undeterred, Frank married another woman also named Ethel and moved to Seattle, where he set up another candy business, which also failed within a year [12:01]. He then moved to Tacoma in 1914, setting up a third failed candy business out of his house [12:28].

## The Rise of Chocolate and Hershey's Dominance

By 1920, Frank and his second wife, Ethel, returned to Minneapolis and started a fourth candy company [12:50]. This time, the difference was chocolate [13:35].

Before this, Milton Hershey had started selling his Hershey's chocolate bars in Pennsylvania in 1900 [09:41]. Hershey's early chocolate was regional and not yet widely popular, as he was still figuring out how to scale production [10:05].

Milton Hershey, having successfully sold a caramel company for $1 million in 1900 ($36-37 million today), discovered chocolate at the 1893 Colombian Exposition in Chicago [14:10]. He purchased chocolate-making equipment from a German company on display and set up a chocolate operation in Lancaster, Pennsylvania [15:05]. At this time, solid chocolate was a relatively new concept, as most chocolate was consumed as a drink [15:41].

The process of making chocolate is complex:
*   **Cocoa fruit to beans**: Cocoa fruit grows on trees, originally in South America, now commonly in Africa [17:48]. The seeds (beans) are key [18:11].
*   **Fermentation and drying**: Beans are fermented in wooden boxes, killing the bean, then dried [18:27]. This happens at the growth site [18:38].
*   **Roasting and winnowing**: Beans are shipped, sorted, sterilized, roasted, and de-shelled (winnowing), resulting in "nibs" [19:11].
*   **Pressing and grinding**: Nibs can be pressed into cocoa powder and cocoa butter [19:39]. Nibs are ground to the right particle size [19:50].
*   **Conching**: In 1879, Rudolph Lindt accidentally discovered conching, a process of continuously rolling chocolate to create a silky smooth texture, allowing for the addition of more cocoa butter for creaminess [20:06].
*   **Tempering**: Conched chocolate needs to be tempered (heated and cooled) to align cocoa butter crystals, giving it shine and a firm snap, preventing "bloom" [21:22].
*   **Adding sugar**: Sugar is added during conching and tempering [23:33].

Milk chocolate was a further innovation. In 1866, Henri Nestle in Switzerland was researching infant feeding and invented a method to concentrate milk powder for baby formula [24:43]. In 1867, his neighbor Daniel Peter, a chocolatier, had the idea to combine this dehydrated milk powder with cocoa and sugar to create a creamy chocolate drink [26:19]. The mixture was initially grainy, but Peter eventually succeeded using condensed milk and slow drying on trays, creating milk chocolate flakes [27:04]. This led to milk chocolate bars in Europe, notably by Cadbury [27:51].

Milton Hershey traveled to Europe, learned about milk chocolate, and through years of trial and error, developed his own method for producing it at scale in his Pennsylvania factory [29:20]. Hershey's milk chocolate developed a slightly sour taste, which became characteristic and accepted by American consumers [30:08]. This sour taste is believed to be from a slow evaporation of non-fat milk over low heat, or from using milk powder that had slightly soured during transatlantic shipping [31:09].

Hershey's strategy focused on being first to market, setting the taste for American chocolate, and achieving massive scale [32:20]. He intentionally priced his Hershey bar at a nickel ($0.05) to make it ubiquitous and pushed for wide distribution across various stores [33:38]. Hershey became the primary supplier of chocolate to other candy makers, acting as the "AWS" of the chocolate business [38:00].

During World War I, the American military sourced chocolate as ration bars, with Hershey's as the main supplier [35:10]. Millions of American GIs were introduced to and became fond of Hershey's chocolate [35:29]. Post-war Prohibition further boosted candy sales as adults sought social lubricants, leading to a boom in candy bars [36:01]. By the end of the 1920s, over 40,000 different candy bars were being made in America, mostly by regional, entrepreneurial operations [36:55].

## Frank's Comeback and the Milky Way

Back in Minneapolis, Frank Mars' fourth candy company found success with chocolate [39:44]. He initially sold "Victorian Buttercreams" and "Patricia's Chocolates" (named after his new daughter with Ethel #2) [40:00]. By 1922, the business was doing $100,000 in revenue, and Frank introduced his first combination bar, the "Mar-O-Bar," which was not a significant success [40:28].

In the summer of 1923, Frank was reunited with his estranged son, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]], after 13 years [42:13]. The legend, as recounted by Mars, suggests [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]], then 19 and a traveling salesman, was jailed in Chicago for a marketing stunt [45:24]. He called Frank for bail, and during their lunch reunion, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] suggested turning a malted milkshake into a candy bar [47:51].

Regardless of the exact origin, Frank Mars released the Milky Way bar in 1924 [49:35]. It was a massive hit, generating $800,000 in sales in its first year, a significant jump from Mar-O-Bar's $73,000 [49:44]. Mars was among the first to mechanize "count lines" (candy bar production), allowing for factory-scale quantities under a single brand [50:00].

## [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]]' Empire Building

[[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest's]] early life in Saskatchewan fostered ambition [50:37]. He supposedly won a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied mining engineering [51:19]. At Berkeley, he finagled a deal in the cafeteria to earn significant money by sourcing cheaper ingredients [52:10]. During a summer break, he reconnected with his now-wealthy father, shifting his ambition from mining to business [53:40].

With Frank's help, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] transferred to Yale, aiming to learn about business [55:17]. His roommate was the nephew of Pierre S. duPont, from whom [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] learned about managing large industrial processes, accounting, and planning [55:46].

After graduating from Yale, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] convinced Frank to move the Mars company to Chicago, the center of the candy industry with better freight distribution [57:25]. While Frank indulged in a lavish, Spanish-style factory exterior, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] focused on the interior, contracting the Austin company (who built Ford's plants) to design state-of-the-art assembly lines [58:47]. [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] pushed for 24/7 production to maximize efficiency and scale economies [59:49]. By 1929, the Chicago factory produced 20 million Milky Way bars annually [01:00:09]. Mars became Hershey's biggest wholesale customer, buying millions of dollars of chocolate annually [01:00:45].

In 1930, Frank introduced the Snickers bar, named after his favorite horse at his Tennessee ranch [01:01:58]. In 1932, the Three Musketeers bar was added [01:04:20]. Originally, Three Musketeers came in three flavors (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry) but was reduced to only chocolate during World War II due to restrictions and rising strawberry prices [01:04:45].

Despite the Great Depression, Mars' revenue soared from $800,000 in 1924 to $25 million in 1932 [01:05:31]. This resilience was due to candy being a cheap "dopamine hit" and Mars' focus on low prices and wide distribution, making its bars accessible even during economic hardship [01:05:59]. Mars strategically built distinct brands for each bar (Milky Way, Snickers, Three Musketeers), rather than variations of one [01:07:05].

### The Break with Frank and European Ventures

[[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] wanted to aggressively reinvest and "conquer the whole goddamn world," but Frank preferred enjoying his wealth [01:08:11]. In 1932, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] issued an ultimatum, asking for one-third of the business to run it, but Frank refused, leading to a bitter split where [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] walked out, telling his father to "stick his business up his ass" [01:08:45].

[[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] left America for Europe with $50,000 and the foreign rights to the Milky Way recipe (but not the name) [01:10:06]. Tragically, Frank died at 50 the next year, and [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] never spoke to him again, not returning for the funeral [01:11:03].

In early 1933, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] moved his family to Switzerland to learn chocolate making from masters like Jean Tobler (Toblerone) and Nestle, working anonymously as a factory line worker [01:16:03]. He believed, "if you want to get rich you got to know how to make a product" [01:15:39].

Towards the end of 1933, he moved to England and used his $50,000 to open a small factory in Slough, adapting the Milky Way recipe for British tastes (more sugar, less malt) and naming it the Mars Bar [01:19:07]. The Mars Bar became the most popular candy bar in the UK [01:19:50]. Like Frank, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] initially bought chocolate from a local supplier, Cadbury, which suited British tastes [01:20:41].

In 1934, just a year after starting the Mars Bar, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] acquired Chapel Brothers, a small British company making canned dog food [01:25:03]. This was revolutionary at the time, as pet food was non-existent; pets ate table scraps [01:25:26]. This diversification into pet food was immediately profitable and generated cash flow for the Mars Bar's expansion [01:27:37].

### The Mars Principles

In Slough, England, the [[business_strategies_and_history | core principles]] and culture of Mars were established:
1.  **Quality**: [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] was obsessed with quality, from ingredients to packaging and shelf placement [01:29:01]. He implemented a system where any employee could stop the production line if they found a defect [01:30:07]. This commitment to quality also meant delivering "value for money" relative to competitors [01:31:02].
2.  **Responsibility**: [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] decentralized decision-making and incentivized employees with high pay (three to four times the normal salary for their job, later 2x or 10% higher than industry average) and bonuses tied to overall company performance [01:31:36]. Employees had to punch time cards, and a 10% bonus was contingent on never being late [01:33:31]. Internally, all employees were called "associates," and there were no perks like executive parking or private offices; Mars became the first "open office" company in the 1930s [01:33:47].
3.  **Mutuality**: [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] understood the importance of the entire ecosystem – retailers, suppliers, distributors – ensuring everyone made money and was incentivized for long-term partnership [01:36:02].
4.  **Efficiency**: [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] was deeply immersed in [[business_strategies_and_history | business strategies]] and management literature [01:36:41]. He focused on "Return on Total Assets" (ROTA), calculating profit divided by the constantly revalued replacement cost of fixed assets [01:38:08]. Mars targeted an 18% ROTA, meaning investments needed to pay for themselves in under five years [01:40:34]. Mars operated with 30% fewer employees than Hershey, generating significantly more output per worker [01:41:44]. They aggressively reinvested profits into R&D for manufacturing equipment [01:43:08].
5.  **Freedom**: This principle represented [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest's]] desire to build his own business free from his father [01:43:40]. Over time, it came to mean family ownership, staying private, avoiding debt, and maintaining extreme privacy [01:43:55]. The family famously bought back photographs taken by a journalist for $20,000 to prevent their re-use [01:44:36].

By 1939, Mars UK became the third-largest candy company in Britain [01:22:48].

## Return to America and M&M's

In 1939, with World War II approaching and fearing a heavy tax on foreign residents in the UK (which he suspected Cadbury and Roundtree lobbied for), [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] returned to the US, leaving his UK businesses running [01:45:38].

He aimed to take control of his father's company, Mars Inc. (Chicago Mars), then run by his stepmother, Ethel #2, and her half-brother, William [01:47:40]. As a minority shareholder, he was initially unwelcome [01:48:10].

[[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]]'s "secret weapon" was the concept of dragées – small, round, candy-coated chocolates that resist melting, popular with soldiers in the Spanish Civil War [01:49:24]. He is thought to have seen Smarties (Roundtree's similar product) in the UK, which launched in 1937, and potentially made a gentleman's agreement with Roundtree for the US market [02:04:02].

In August 1939, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] visited Hershey, Pennsylvania, and dramatically presented his non-melting chocolate to William Murray, Hershey's president and COO [01:54:25]. Recognizing the product's potential, especially for the military, Murray agreed to a joint venture: M&M Limited, 80% owned by [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] and 20% by Murray's son, Bruce [01:57:26]. This deal was brilliant because Hershey had an exclusive contract to supply chocolate to the US military, and [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] offered Murray's son a legacy outside of Hershey [01:59:07].

M&M Limited started production in 1941 in New York, New Jersey, using Hershey's chocolate and resources [02:00:57]. As the US entered WWII, chocolate rationing for consumers began, but military consumption soared [02:01:38]. Hershey limited its wholesale supply to all customers *except* M&M Limited, making M&M's a key military ration for the Air Force, Army, and Navy [02:02:10].

During the war, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] also sought a diversification equivalent to his UK pet food business [02:06:19]. In 1942, he partnered with a chemist to form a joint venture in Houston, Texas, patenting a "par-boiling" method for milling rice that made it more nutritious and faster cooking [02:07:05]. This product, Uncle Ben's Rice (now Ben's Original), was also sold to the military for cheap calories and became America's first branded rice product, eventually doing over a billion dollars in annual revenue [02:07:29].

After the war, M&M's consumer launch in America was initially tepid [02:09:10]. This led to tension between [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] and Bruce Murray [02:09:25]. [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] employed aggressive tactics, including publicly shaming Bruce by taping "FAILED" reports of daily sales in the men's bathroom [02:09:48]. In 1949, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] successfully pushed Bruce out, buying his 20% stake for $1 million (approx. $13 million in 2024 dollars), gaining 100% ownership of M&M Limited [02:10:00].

Immediately after acquiring full ownership, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] hired the Ted Bates and Company ad agency in 1950 to conduct market research [02:12:42]. Unlike Hershey, which had a strict "no advertising" policy until 1970 [02:13:25], [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] embraced sophisticated marketing [02:13:05]. The study found that M&M's appealed strongly to children, even though parents were the buyers [02:15:01]. This insight led to the iconic slogan: "The milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand" [02:15:54]. This slogan perfectly captured parents' desire for clean candy consumption, making M&M's a convenient choice [02:16:09].

M&M's were also marketed through sponsorships of popular children's TV shows like The Mickey Mouse Club and Howdy Doody [02:17:26]. By 1956, M&M's had become the biggest selling candy in America, surpassing Snickers, Milky Way, and even the Hershey's bar, achieving $40 million in annual sales [02:17:40]. To combat copycats, the "m" was added to each piece (black initially, then white in 1954), with an ad campaign to "look for the M" [02:18:07]. The first animated M&M's characters appeared in TV commercials in 1954 [02:18:52].

Hershey's, seeing M&M's success, launched "Hershey-ettes," but struggled because they were seen as copycats [02:19:28]. The 1982 movie *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* famously featured Reese's Pieces instead of M&M's, as Mars declined the product placement deal [03:23:05]. This boosted Reese's Pieces sales three-fold [03:24:39].

In 1955, Mars also ventured into the vending machine business in England, through Vendpack, which developed coin mechanisms and bill validators [02:21:05].

## Forest Takes Control of Mars Inc. and the Chocolate Wars

By the mid-1950s, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest's]] independent empire (Mars UK, M&M's, Uncle Ben's Rice, Pet Food) was doing roughly $200 million in annual revenue, four times the size of Chicago Mars ($50 million) [02:22:22].

After Frank Mars died, his second wife, Ethel, received the majority (two-thirds) of Mars Inc. stock [02:30:26]. When Ethel died in 1945, her stock was split 50/50 between Patricia (Frank's daughter with Ethel #2) and [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]], giving [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] about a third of the company [02:24:09].

In the 1950s, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] began his quest to take control of Chicago Mars [02:24:28]. He demanded an office and inspection rights, which were granted [02:24:36]. He then used this access to heavily criticize the current CEO (Ethel's half-brother, William) in memos to the board, essentially lobbying to take over [02:25:05].

When William retired in 1959, Patricia installed her husband, James, as CEO [02:25:56]. James was a "totally terrible CEO," and under his leadership, Mars' revenue dropped from $50 million to $40 million by 1963 [02:26:24]. This decline put severe pressure on the company's financials due to its high fixed costs, a "convenient disaster" for [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] [02:26:42].

In 1963, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] convinced Patricia to sell him her shares, under two conditions: James would not be fired, and Mars Incorporated would become the parent company for all of [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest's]] businesses, preserving Frank's legacy [02:27:35]. [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] agreed [02:28:13]. Over the next few months, he bought out other shareholders, and by mid-1964, he had full control of Mars Incorporated [02:28:37].

Upon taking control, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] immediately enforced his principles: he ripped out all office walls, created an open floor plan, demolished the executive dining room, sold the company art collection and helicopter, and gave everyone, including James, a time card [02:29:57]. Tragically, Patricia died of cancer later that year, and [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] promptly fired James and made himself CEO of the entire unified empire [02:30:26].

[[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest's]] final conquest was to make his own chocolate in America, severing ties with Hershey [02:31:19]. He gave his Chicago plant managers six months to start making their own chocolate [02:32:53]. Hershey's leadership predicted it would take Mars at least 10 years to become profitable on this investment, but [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] saw it as essential for quality control and greater scale [02:32:02].

The "Chocolate Wars" with Hershey escalated due to pricing and size strategies [02:44:17]. Hershey had maintained the price of its original chocolate bar at a nickel from 1900 until 1969 [02:40:17]. To manage inflation, Hershey continuously shrunk the bar size [02:40:47]. By 1969, it was half its original weight [02:41:19]. When Hershey finally raised the price to 10 cents in 1969, consumers were outraged, especially as the price hike exposed years of "shrinkflation" [02:43:07].

[[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] capitalized on this by increasing Mars' advertising and, crucially, increasing the size of Mars bars while keeping prices the same [02:44:01]. This "price and size war" put Hershey in a difficult position [02:44:17]. Hershey finally started advertising in 1970, which initially worked, but the board pulled the plug after two years due to high commodity prices impacting profits [02:44:54]. As a result, in 1973, the combined Mars (including M&M's, Snickers, Milky Way, Three Musketeers) surpassed Hershey to become the number one candy company in America [02:45:07]. Mars maintained a competitive advantage due to its "count line" bars having lower cost of goods sold (nougat, peanuts) compared to Hershey's pure chocolate bars [02:46:09]. Mars also developed a sophisticated commodities trading department, often profiting from market swings [02:47:03].

## Later Years and Global Expansion

In 1973, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] retired at 76, handing the company over to his three children: Forest Jr., John Mars, and Jackie Mars [02:48:08]. The company, then doing about $800 million in annual revenue, became even more private after his retirement, severely limiting external communication [02:49:01].

In 1980, at 76, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest]] re-entered the candy business, starting Ethel M Chocolates, named after his mother [02:49:42]. His business plan was to create a high-end chocolate competitor to See's Candies, specializing in liquor-filled chocolates [02:50:24]. He moved to Nevada, where such chocolates were legal, and ran the business from an apartment directly above the factory [02:51:12]. Ethel M became a success, reaching $150 million in revenue within a couple of years [02:51:55]. In 1988, Mars, run by his children, acquired Ethel M Chocolates [02:52:12].

During the tenure of [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest's]] children (Forest Jr., John, Jackie), Mars grew from $800 million to $20 billion in revenue by 2001 [02:55:22]. This growth was driven by new product launches (Skittles in 1974, Twix, Starburst), acquisitions (Kal Kan Foods in 1986, becoming Pedigree and Whiskas; Dove bars in 1986), and, most significantly, globalization [02:56:06]. The brothers expanded Mars into Japan, China, Russia, the Middle East, and South America [02:56:44]. They unified product brands globally (e.g., Snickers is Snickers everywhere) and sponsored the Olympics to market internationally [02:55:42].

## Major Acquisitions and Mars Today

Mars continued its [[business_strategies_and_history | acquisition strategy]]:
*   **Wrigley (2008)**: Mars acquired the Wrigley chewing gum company for $23 billion with financing assistance from Berkshire Hathaway and Goldman Sachs [02:57:04]. Warren Buffett famously quipped he had been conducting a "70-year taste test" on both Mars and Wrigley [02:57:17]. Wrigley, with its high gross margins from petroleum-based gum products and ownership of mints like Altoids and Lifesavers, was a highly profitable business [03:04:06].
*   **Pet Hospitals (2000s-2017)**: Mars expanded its pet care division beyond food. In 2002, they bought Royal Canin, a French company making prescription pet food [03:06:43]. They then acquired a significant stake in Banfield Pet Hospital chain (largest in America, often located in PetSmart stores) in 2007, fully buying it out by 2015 [03:07:08]. In 2017, Mars acquired VCA, the largest independent vet hospital operator in America, for $9 billion [03:06:04]. Mars now owns 3,000 out of 35,000-40,000 vet locations in the US, about 8% of the market [03:15:13]. This marked a significant diversification into a services business [03:06:28].
*   **Kind Bar (2020)**: Mars acquired Kind (nutrition bars) for $5 billion in 2020, after an initial partial investment [03:09:43]. Kind was doing $1.5 billion in domestic revenue, primarily through Starbucks checkout counters, and Mars took it global [03:09:55].
*   **Kellanova (Proposed Acquisition)**: In August, Mars announced a definitive agreement to purchase Kellanova (Kellogg's international cereal and snack businesses, including Pringles, Pop-Tarts, RX Bar) for $35.9 billion [03:10:00]. This would be the largest CPG transaction since 2015 and would make Mars look much more like Nestle, a significantly more diversified competitor [03:11:41].

Today, Mars remains a private company. In 2023, its revenue was $50 billion [03:13:33]. While widely known for its candy, the largest segment of its business is Pet Care, accounting for 59% of revenue and nearly 100,000 out of 140,000 employees [03:14:02]. Mars and Hershey each hold about 24% of the US candy market share [03:15:47]. Globally, the candy industry is more fragmented, with Mars holding 11% [03:16:03].

## Analysis

### Powers
*   **Scale Economies**: Mars consistently leveraged scale economies through mass production, wide distribution, and efficient operations [03:17:49]. This allows them to amortize fixed costs across huge sales volumes.
*   **Branding**: While not necessarily charging higher prices, Mars' strong brands (Snickers, M&M's) create immense consumer trust and drive volume and repeat purchases, leading to significant lifetime margin dollars [03:19:39].
*   **Switching Costs**: Particularly evident in the Pet Care business, once pets are accustomed to certain foods, or owners choose a veterinary hospital, switching costs for consumers are very high [03:22:25].
*   **Process Power**: Mars' relentless focus on efficiency, often through proprietary, unpatented improvements in manufacturing equipment, gives them a continuous edge [03:20:49].

### Playbook
*   **Marketing and Distribution as Key Differentiators**: Especially post-1960s with the advent of television and supermarkets, Mars mastered marketing to drive demand and secure prime shelf space [02:22:56]. The "melts in your mouth, not in your hand" campaign for M&M's and strategic partnerships (Olympics, NFL, NASA) are prime examples [02:15:54].
*   **Recession-Proof Businesses**: Candy and pet food businesses have proven resilient during economic downturns, as consumers continue to buy these products [03:10:10].
*   **Chocolate as a Complex Food**: Chocolate is a rich, complex food, not just a treat, ensuring its enduring appeal despite health trends [03:32:16]. However, [[climate_change_impact_on_chocolate_industry | climate change]] is impacting cocoa tree production, leading to genetic engineering that may compromise taste for resilience [03:34:17].
*   **Mastering Conglomeration**: From its earliest days, Mars embraced diversification across different product categories and geographies (candy, pet food, rice in UK and US), developing strong internal capabilities for acquisitions and decentralized management [03:35:52].
*   **Long-Term Duration and Growth**: Mars has consistently grown its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 14% for over a century, a testament to its global applicability, strong margin structure, operational efficiency, and recurring purchases [03:37:02].

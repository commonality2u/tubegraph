The early journey of a subscription-based media business highlights the critical role of adaptability, initial product failures, and the unique feedback mechanisms inherent in a subscription model.

## Initial Challenges and Pivots

Launching a subscription-based product in 2014 was met with significant skepticism, with many, including VCs, believing "subscriptions are not a thing on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The initial launch was plagued by technical issues, including a security certificate problem that prevented purchases for the first 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This was compounded by a pre-scheduled announcement from Kara Swisher, creating a "stupid artificial deadline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The product itself was described as "super confusing" and "very janky," failing to provide a good experience for both paying and non-paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This led to the realization that the "business model was wrong, the product was wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### The Accidental Email "Hack"

In response to the initial failure, the entire website structure was scrapped over a weekend, reverting to the old site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Subscribers were informed that content would be delivered via daily emails, alongside an archive on the website sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This pivot, initially seen as "completely and utterly ass backwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, proved crucial.

Despite setting one-day, one-week, and one-month subscriber goals, all were "failed pretty significantly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The speaker faced financial hardship, including stopping credit card payments to preserve cash in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, and even double-charged some initial subscribers, requiring extensive refunds and customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Growth and Model Refinement

Despite the initial setbacks and the widespread belief that the venture wouldn't succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, the speaker persisted due to a "pride factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Subscriber numbers, though small, showed consistent month-over-month growth from April to July 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Simplification and Validation

A key [[marketing_strategies_and_customer_acquisition | growth strategy]] was simplifying the subscription model to a single price and a single product, eliminating tiered levels like a "$300 level" for chat and calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

A significant "step change" in subscriber growth occurred in November when the business announced its viability. This led to 250 new subscribers in 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, proving the model worked and reaching the one-year goal of 1,000 subscribers much earlier than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This highlighted a psychological aspect: potential subscribers were hesitant to pay if they believed the business would fail and they would lose their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Once the entity's ongoing nature was clear, they subscribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

The speaker notes that platforms like Substack benefit from this shift, as people are no longer "scared to give their money to some random writer on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Evolution of Content Delivery and [[The importance of adaptability in business models | Adaptability]]

While the initial accidental pivot to email was successful, the strategy for content delivery has evolved beyond just email. The speaker views the publication as a platform that should make it "as easy for you to consume in the way you want to consume as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Today, content is available via podcasts (daily updates and articles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, SMS links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, the website, and RSS feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Email is considered a "tactic," not a "strategy," emphasizing that the core strategy is "differentiation," "consistency," and ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## The Role of Customer Feedback in Subscription Models

The subscription model provides a "beautiful thing" from a writer's perspective: the primary focus is "keeping my subscribers happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This focus on the existing customer base ensures recurring revenue, which is "really really powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Direct Feedback and Marketing

Subscribers serve as the primary marketing channel, with word-of-mouth spreading the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. To leverage this, the platform developed technology (Passport) that allows tokenized links in emails to provide "one link deep" access to paid articles when forwarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This encourages sharing while still directing new users to the paywall for deeper engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

The most valuable [[Marketing strategies and customer acquisition | feedback mechanism]] in a subscription model is the subscriber number itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Unlike social media, where feedback often comes from a small, vocal minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, subscriber numbers indicate a large, appreciative audience, often "dark matter" who never directly interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The act of someone pulling out their credit card to pay is "so valuable and so positive from an incentive structure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Niche Focus and Customer Retention

While subscription models can lead to a niche audience, a significant advantage, once scale is achieved, is the ability to not "pander to your audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The speaker, having built a large enough audience, can dismiss rude or disrespectful subscribers by cancelling their subscription and refunding their entire purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This contrasts sharply with ad-supported models, where large advertisers hold significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Being an early mover in the market also provided the advantage of addressing less controversial topics initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

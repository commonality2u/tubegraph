On December 1, 2020, Salesforce announced its acquisition of Slack Technologies for a total purchase price of $27.7 billion [00:06:04]. This significant event prompted an emergency podcast by "Acquired" to discuss the implications [00:00:08].

## Background and Context

Leading up to the acquisition, Slack's stock performance had been "suffering," experiencing fluctuations since its direct listing [00:04:13]. Despite this, Packy McCormick, a noted "Slack bull," had recently published a piece in "Not Boring" arguing that the market was underestimating Slack [00:03:56]. He highlighted Slack's strong underlying metrics, such as being a top-quartile SaaS company in terms of growth, net dollar retention, and gross margin [00:04:50].

## Acquisition Specifics

The deal, valued at $27.7 billion, breaks down to approximately $45.86 per share in a mix of cash and stock, with a slightly heavier emphasis on stock (roughly 55-57%) [00:06:07]. This represents a 55% premium to Slack's trading price before the news leaked, and an 85% premium to its price after its September earnings report [00:06:23]. This purchase price marks the first time Slack's share price surpassed its direct public offering (DPO) first-day trading price [00:06:41].

The acquisition is expected to close in 2021, pending shareholder approval from Slack's shareholders [00:07:17]. It stands as the largest pure software deal since IBM acquired Red Hat in 2018 [00:07:27]. Slack is slated to remain independent, with its CEO, Stewart Butterfield, continuing to lead the company [00:07:10].

The acquisition drew parallels to Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn, which was valued at a similar amount ($24 billion) [00:02:26]. Salesforce had also been a bidder for LinkedIn and subsequently filed an antitrust suit against Microsoft over that deal [00:08:40].

## Strategic Rationale for Salesforce

The core rationale for Salesforce's acquisition of Slack appears to be a [[salesforce_strategic_acquisitions | strategic acquisition]] focused on distribution and combating Microsoft [00:26:46].

Salesforce envisions Slack as the "operating system for the new way to work," deeply integrating it into every Salesforce Cloud as the new interface for Salesforce Customer 360 [00:24:50]. This aims to "transform how people communicate" within the Salesforce ecosystem [00:25:08].

### Distribution and Enterprise Reach
Slack's historical growth model focused on attracting small, innovative organizations and growing with them, leading to future free cash flow [00:27:33]. However, its playbook lacked a credible way to onboard large enterprises [00:28:09]. Salesforce, with its massive sales force and enterprise relationships, provides this missing piece, enabling Slack to reach larger organizations [00:26:34]. This aligns with a strategy of "growing by acquisition" for companies with strong core businesses but not necessarily "insane growth" [01:04:09].

### The "Anti-Microsoft" Alliance
The acquisition is framed as a show of force for "best-of-breed" applications against Microsoft's integrated but potentially less specialized suite [00:21:17]. Salesforce aims to be the "credible centerpiece" of this best-of-breed ecosystem, akin to the open-source ecosystem versus the Microsoft stack in the developer world [00:24:08]. This could alleviate "subscription fatigue" and procurement pain for enterprises dealing with numerous individual SaaS services [00:45:30].

### [[Slack Connect and its strategic importance | Slack Connect]]
A key strategic appeal for Salesforce is [[slack_connect_and_its_strategic_importance | Slack Connect]], which facilitates communication between companies, their partners, and clients [00:29:12]. This feature saw significant growth, with endpoints increasing from 380,000 to 520,000 in the quarter leading up to the acquisition [00:29:47]. The ability to integrate client communications directly into a Salesforce lead or deal pipeline makes significant sense for sales operations [00:29:26]. Slack Connect's growth also serves as a "try before you buy" mechanism for prospective Slack users, as partners encourage its adoption [00:31:12].

## Why Slack Chose to Sell

Despite its strong financial metrics, including becoming free cash flow positive (from $10 million to $36 million in the quarter) [00:38:27] and maintaining high gross margins (86%) [00:38:24], Slack's revenue growth rate was slowing (from 49% year-over-year to 39% year-over-year in the latest quarter) [00:39:51].

The primary reason for Slack's perceived undervaluation in the public market was the omnipresent threat of [[microsoft_teams_vs_slack | Microsoft Teams]] [00:10:49]. Microsoft actively positioned Teams as a direct competitor to Slack, explicitly naming Slack in its user charts [00:11:22]. This aggressive posture, unprecedented for Microsoft since the Larry Ellison/Oracle days, was seen as a major factor depressing Slack's stock [00:11:28].

Accepting a 55% premium offer was compelling, especially given the ongoing market pressure and the fatigue of constantly battling Microsoft's aggressive distribution tactics [00:41:51]. Furthermore, for Stewart Butterfield, the acquisition offered the "best chance to realize the mission the soonest" by leveraging Salesforce's immense sales and distribution capabilities, allowing him to remain focused on product development rather than becoming a "sales guy" [00:44:20].

## The Role of Microsoft

Microsoft's strategy in the market was a central theme [00:08:57]. Microsoft Teams boasted significantly more users than Slack (e.g., 100 million vs. 12 million) [00:13:22]. However, critics argue this comparison is "apples and oranges" [00:20:25]. Teams is often pre-installed or automatically launched on Windows PCs [00:14:28] and bundled with Office 365, making its user count potentially inflated in terms of active, intentional usage [00:14:33].

Microsoft's aggressive targeting of Slack stemmed from Slack's potential to disrupt email (Outlook) and, by extension, the entire Microsoft Office suite by becoming a central collaboration hub [00:11:01]. While Microsoft Teams is a competitor to Zoom for video conferencing, its core architecture is different from Slack's [00:13:50], aiming to be a hub for all Microsoft applications rather than a flexible chat tool for large, dynamic organizations [00:14:14]. This direct naming and aggressive comparison was a deliberate strategy to "knock out a competitor" using Microsoft's powerful distribution [00:15:15].

## What If? Alternative Acquirers

The discussion also explored other potential acquirers for Slack:

*   **Google:** Many saw a strong synergy with Google's G Suite (Gmail, Google Sheets, Google Docs) [01:05:53]. A Google-Slack bundle, possibly including Looker, could have created a formidable "new wave office bundle" against Microsoft [01:06:16]. Google possesses vast financial resources, making a large acquisition feasible without debt [01:09:37]. The deep product integrations between Slack and Google's products already existed, indicating a familiarity that often precedes acquisitions [01:08:04].
*   **Amazon:** Amazon had an existing partnership with Slack, powering its video product and serving as a major AWS customer [01:06:54].
*   **Zoom:** While Zoom had a high market capitalization ($130+ billion) [01:10:30] and could have used its stock as currency, it was speculated that Slack might not have wanted Zoom stock at its valuation [01:10:43]. Additionally, Zoom reportedly had an underdeveloped corporate development function, suggesting that such a large deal would require direct CEO involvement, which Eric Yuan seemed to prioritize elsewhere, focusing on building Zoom into a video platform [01:11:01].

## Bear Case for Slack (Independent & Post-Acquisition)

Even as an independent company, a significant bear case for Slack stemmed from the rise of "deep collaboration" tools [00:48:16]. Apps like Figma, Notion, and Coda are increasingly embedding chat and collaboration features directly within their products, reducing the need for users to switch to a separate communication tool like Slack to get work done [00:48:22]. In this scenario, Slack might devolve into a "backup" or "emergency" chat tool, or primarily for broad company announcements, similar to email today [00:49:07]. This risk highlights the potential for a "next wave of software" to cut off Slack's bottom-up growth [00:50:34].

Post-acquisition, the bear case involves the "stench" of being part of Salesforce [02:08:52]. While Salesforce generally keeps its acquisitions separate and doesn't heavily cross-sell (e.g., Quip, Heroku) [02:21:07], there's a risk of product atrophy [02:22:54]. If Slack becomes less innovative or caters more to Salesforce's enterprise sales motion than its core startup user base, newer, agile collaboration tools (like Discord) could steal the "upstarts" and erode Slack's position as an "infrastructure choice" for fast-growing companies [02:29:50].

## Slack's Public Company Tenure: A C- Grade

Slack's tenure as a public company was assessed as a "C minus" [01:13:42]. While the acquisition price ultimately exceeded its DPO first-day trading price, the stock largely traded flat or down for 15-16 months, underperforming the broader market [01:13:56]. Despite strong underlying business performance, the market "doubted the businesses long-term prospects" [01:16:04], largely due to the narrative surrounding [[microsoft_teams_vs_slack | Microsoft Teams]] [01:14:25]. The company struggled to effectively communicate its value proposition and counter this narrative [01:16:40].

## Future Scenarios for Slack within Salesforce

### F-Scenario
The worst-case scenario (F) for Salesforce's acquisition of Slack involves a strategic misstep where the "anti-Microsoft alliance" or "best-of-breed" strategy fails to resonate with large enterprises [01:20:06]. This could be exacerbated if Salesforce attempts to force product integration that turns Slack into a clunky, "Salesforce-like" experience, rather than Salesforce adapting to Slack [01:21:23]. This could alienate Slack's core user base, leading startups to abandon it for newer tools like Discord, perceiving Slack as part of a legacy enterprise suite [01:20:33].

### A+-Scenario
The best-case scenario (A+) sees Salesforce successfully leveraging its distribution channel to massively accelerate Slack's revenue growth [01:23:58]. Salesforce's endorsement could make Slack a "trustworthy vendor" for larger companies, unlocking new markets and enabling mass adoption for thousands of seats [01:24:20]. Furthermore, this acquisition could catalyze the broader "anti-Microsoft alliance," positioning Salesforce as a successful alternative distribution channel for other best-of-breed SaaS companies (e.g., Superhuman, Coda, Notion) [01:25:01].

### C-Scenario
A middle-ground scenario (C) suggests that Slack Connect could humanize the sales process for Salesforce, making interactions with clients more enjoyable and building network effects between companies [01:25:50]. However, this might not lead to the transformative market shift envisioned in the A+ scenario, with product integration remaining modest and the "stench" of being owned by a large enterprise potentially stifling some of Slack's independent innovation [01:21:01].

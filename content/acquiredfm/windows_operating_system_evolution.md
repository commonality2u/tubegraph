[[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]] created the business model for selling software, a model often remarked as the best of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Today, the company is the world's most valuable, worth over $3 trillion, with 49 years of history in software, hardware, gaming, and cloud computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This article traces the evolution of Microsoft's flagship operating system, Windows, from its nascent beginnings in the PC era to its dominance.

## Early Computing Landscape
In 1968, computers were primarily massive room-sized machines, or even human calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The market was dominated by [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]], which built both hardware (like the System/360) and software, and provided services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Due to antitrust scrutiny, [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] unbundled its offerings in 1968, inadvertently opening the door for independent software vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) introduced "mini computers" – smaller, less powerful, and cheaper machines. These were a disruptive force, targeting new markets rather than competing directly with [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]]'s mainframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Bill Gates idolized DEC's founder, Ken Olsen, and their low-end disruption strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

## Microsoft's Founding and DOS Era
[[Bill Gates and Windows development history | Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen, through their early ventures, gained experience with microprocessors, recognizing their potential for a large-scale software business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. Their vision, fueled by Paul Allen's understanding of Moore's Law, was "a computer on every desk in every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. They founded Microsoft (short for "microcomputer software") in 1975, focused purely on software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

### The IBM PC Deal
In 1980, [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] decided to enter the microcomputer market with "Project Chess," a secret division to develop the [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] PC within a year, using off-the-shelf components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:07">[01:32:07]</a>. [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] needed an operating system for its new PC. Microsoft, having primarily developed programming languages like BASIC, initially referred [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] to Digital Research, makers of the CP/M operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.

After a botched negotiation between [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] and Digital Research, [[Bill Gates and Windows development history | Bill Gates]] acquired a 16-bit operating system called QDOS ("Quick and Dirty Operating System") from Seattle Computer Products for $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>. This became DOS (Disk Operating System), which Microsoft licensed to [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] for a fixed fee of $430,000, with no ongoing royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>. Crucially, Microsoft retained the rights to license DOS to any other manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">[01:50:04]</a>.

### DOS Dominance and the Rise of Clones
The [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] PC, launched in August 1981, became an unquestionable market leader, selling half a million units in its first two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:18">[01:55:18]</a>. [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] also priced DOS at a mere $60, significantly cheaper than competing operating systems like CP/M, making it the de facto standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a>.

This created a market for [[Market strategy and business growth through Windows 95 | IBM PC clones]]. Companies like Compaq reverse-engineered the [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] PC's proprietary BIOS and produced cheaper, compatible hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a>. Microsoft licensed DOS to all these clone manufacturers on a per-machine-sold basis, leading to an explosion of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:12">[02:01:12]</a>. By fiscal year 1984, Microsoft's revenue soared to $98 million, driven by high-margin software sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:32">[02:02:32]</a>. This established Microsoft as the "lynchpin" of the entire PC ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:29">[01:51:29]</a>.

## Emergence of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Early Windows
The Macintosh, launched in 1984, brought the graphical user interface (GUI) to the mainstream, featuring a mouse and a desktop metaphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:09">[02:08:09]</a>. [[Microsofts transition to graphical user interface | Microsoft]] was heavily involved in the Mac's development, providing applications like Excel (the world's first graphical spreadsheet) that became "killer apps" for the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:51">[02:26:51]</a>.

Recognizing the future, [[Microsofts transition to graphical user interface | Microsoft]] began developing its own GUI, initially codenamed "Interface Manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:20">[02:36:20]</a>. This product was announced in November 1983, before the Mac shipped, and was eventually named Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:27">[02:36:27]</a>.

### Windows 1.0 and OS/2
Windows 1.0, released in November 1985, was a basic graphical environment running on top of DOS, with "tiled" rather than overlapping windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:59">[02:39:59]</a>. Apple licensed some of its UI intellectual property to Microsoft for Windows 1.0 and "all future versions," a decision that would later haunt Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:01">[02:39:01]</a>.

Meanwhile, [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] sought to regain control of the PC ecosystem with OS/2, a new proprietary operating system developed in partnership with Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:05">[02:42:05]</a>. Microsoft committed heavily to OS/2, but also hedged its bets with Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:50">[02:44:50]</a>. OS/2, however, was not well-received, and the market rejected [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]]'s attempt at recentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:28">[02:47:28]</a>.

### Windows 3.0 and the Strategic Shift
The "divorce" between [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] and Microsoft became official by the end of 1990, with [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] taking full control of OS/2 development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:01">[03:07:01]</a>. This left Microsoft free to bet on Windows.

Windows 3.0, released in 1990, was a breakthrough. It offered a much-improved graphical user interface with true multitasking and ran effectively on the more powerful Intel 386 and 486 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:45">[02:48:45]</a>. Windows 3.0 doubled the penetration of previous Windows versions within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:17">[02:49:17]</a>. This success prompted [[Microsofts strategy shifts from consumer to enterprise focus | Microsoft]]'s executives to officially make Windows "Plan A," promoting the once-misfit Windows team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>.

By 1991, [[Bill Gates and Windows development history | Bill Gates]] articulated Microsoft's strategy: "Windows—one evolving architecture, a couple of implementations, and an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This focused on a unified API (Win32) for developers while supporting multiple implementations, including the emerging Windows NT for enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:41">[03:13:41]</a>.

## Windows 95: Mainstream Phenomenon
The period around Windows 95 marked the "heyday of the consumer PC," with 75 million Windows users even before its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>. Windows 95, code-named "Chicago" (in contrast to the ambitious but never-shipped "Cairo"), was designed as an OS "for the every man," easy to use and intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:40">[03:16:40]</a>.

The launch of [[Market strategy and business growth through Windows 95 | Windows 95]] on August 24, 1995, was a global spectacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:49">[03:20:49]</a>. [[Market strategy and business growth through Windows 95 | Microsoft]] set up tents, flew in journalists, and hired Jay Leno to co-host the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:09">[03:18:09]</a>. The company licensed "Start Me Up" by the Rolling Stones as the official theme song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:14">[03:19:14]</a>. It was an unprecedented marketing event for an operating system, with lines around the block to buy copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:38">[03:20:38]</a>. Coca-Cola even consulted [[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]] on their marketing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:03">[03:21:03]</a>.

[[Market strategy and business growth through Windows 95 | Windows 95]] sold a million copies in its first week and 7 million in its first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:46">[03:26:46]</a>. This solidified Windows as [[Market strategy and business growth through Windows 95 | Microsoft]]'s franchise product for the next two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:21">[03:26:21]</a>. Technically, while it could still use DOS in fallback situations, [[Market strategy and business growth through Windows 95 | Windows 95]] was largely its own 32-bit operating system, providing a robust user experience with features like the iconic "Start Menu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:10">[03:28:10]</a>.

## Key Strategic Pillars
*   **Capital Efficiency & Control:** [[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]]'s high-margin software business required little external capital, allowing founders to maintain significant ownership and strategic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:03">[03:31:03]</a>.
*   **Hedging Bets:** In a dynamic market, [[Bill Gates and Windows development history | Bill Gates]] was a master of hedging, pursuing multiple paths (like OS/2 and Windows) rather than committing to a single, potentially wrong, future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:41">[03:40:41]</a>.
*   **Leveraging New Technologies:** [[Evolution of the software industry | Microsoft]] thrived by identifying and capitalizing on new technological generations, like microprocessors and graphical user interfaces, to disrupt incumbents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Scalability through OEMs:** Unlike Apple's integrated approach, [[Microsofts transition to graphical user interface | Microsoft]]'s strategy of licensing its software to a multitude of OEM hardware manufacturers allowed for immense scale and market penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:58">[03:46:58]</a>.
*   **Early Internationalization:** [[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]]'s early push into international markets, particularly Japan, forced global readiness into its product development from the start, accelerating its path to becoming a global standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:01">[03:48:01]</a>.
*   **"Software is Never Done":** [[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]] understood that software is an ongoing process of iteration and improvement, constantly learning from customer feedback and releasing new versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:47">[03:53:47]</a>.

## Power Dynamics
According to Hamilton Helmer's "Seven Powers" framework, [[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]] exhibited almost all of them during this period:
*   **Counter Positioning:** [[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]] willingly embraced the microcomputer revolution and a software-only business model that incumbents like [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] were unwilling or unable to fully commit to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:11">[03:56:11]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies:** By amortizing development costs across a massive user base (millions of users for Excel, millions of copies of Windows), [[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]] achieved unparalleled cost advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:46">[03:57:46]</a>.
*   **Switching Costs:** Once users and organizations adopted [[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]]'s operating systems and applications, the cost and effort of switching to alternatives (e.g., compatibility with file formats) became prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:30">[03:58:30]</a>.
*   **Network Economies:** More Windows users attracted more developers to create applications, which in turn attracted more users. Document formats (like Word and Excel files) also created powerful network effects between users and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:50">[03:58:50]</a>.
*   **Branding:** The pervasive presence of [[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]]'s software, coupled with highly visible marketing campaigns like [[Market strategy and business growth through Windows 95 | Windows 95]]'s launch, built a powerful global brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:03">[03:21:03]</a>.
*   **Cornered Resource:** [[Bill Gates and Windows development history | Bill Gates]] and his early team possessed an obscure, highly valuable skill set in software development for microprocessors that was scarce at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:37">[03:34:37]</a>.

By 1993, [[Microsofts founding and early history | Microsoft]] had surpassed [[Development of MSDOS and the IBM partnership | IBM]] in market capitalization, effectively inheriting the computing throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:43">[02:55:43]</a>.

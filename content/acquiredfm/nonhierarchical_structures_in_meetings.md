Benchmark's unique dinner tradition, held in their office dining room, aims to foster open discussion and learning through a specific non-hierarchical meeting structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This tradition originated from an experiment by partners Bill Gurley and Peter Fenton, who sought to inject new practices and ideas into the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Origin and Purpose

The concept was inspired by Ben Franklin's biography, detailing his four weekly dinners focused on deep dives into subjects like finance, chemistry, and life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. An initial experimental dinner in 2006 or 2007, attended by Benchmark partners and four outside guests (Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos), was described as "electric" and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Peter Fenton views a venture firm as a "collection of habits," drawing on William James's philosophy that "we are nothing but an amalgamation of our habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The core purpose of these dinners is to nurture curiosity, considered the "essential lifeblood of the firm," through a consistent habit of "open-ended, no agenda, wild explorations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This environment encourages "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved in a one-on-one setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## The Non-Hierarchical Table Design

A key challenge identified in traditional meeting structures is the inherent power dynamics of tables: rectangular tables embed a power structure, while circular tables can atomize the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. To address this, Peter Fenton sought a design that could "deconstruct power centers" and create a "non-hierarchical construct with intimacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

He was inspired by a concept from French designer Jean-Marie Masoud for an organic table that could expand and collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The resulting table was designed by Ole Lundberg based on Fenton's hand sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This unique table design embodies the firm's ethos:

*   **One Conversation**: The table's structure makes sidebar conversations impossible, ensuring "it's all one conversation" and everyone is "all tuned in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This fosters a shared understanding of all discussions, whether good, bad, or tough news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **No Pre-selling**: This contrasts sharply with traditional venture capital meeting norms where partners might "pre-sell a deal" through side conversations before a formal meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Benchmark's approach, as described by Bruce Dunleavy, was "no pre-selling a deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Impact and Guest Engagement

The dinners are not limited to the five partners; they often host "esteemed guests" from various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. These guests are often individuals Benchmark has not worked with or invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Notable past attendees include Dylan Field (Figma), Tobi LÃ¼tke (Shopify), and Jeff Bezos (Amazon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The practice of inviting such guests reflects the firm's commitment to "constantly learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> and providing the "spotlight of attention," which is considered the "biggest gift you can give to another human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

This emphasis on open, non-hierarchical communication and collective engagement demonstrates Benchmark's distinctive approach to [[corporate_governance_and_leadership | corporate governance and leadership]] and reinforces its [[hiring_and_building_organizational_culture_in_startups | organizational culture]] within the context of [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | venture capital]].

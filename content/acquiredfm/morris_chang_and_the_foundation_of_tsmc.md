Morris Chang is a seminal figure in the semiconductor industry, having founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which has become [[the_semiconductor_industrys_evolution_and_tsmcs_role | one of the most important companies]] in the global tech landscape. This article explores the journey of Morris Chang in establishing TSMC and the critical decisions that shaped its trajectory.

## Background and Early Ambitions

Morris Chang began his career at Texas Instruments (TI), where he eventually led the company's worldwide semiconductor business. Frustrated by TI's reluctance to increase R&D budget beyond 4.8% of revenue, Chang envisioned a different kind of company where dedicated resources could spur innovation without annual negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

## The Birth of TSMC

TSMC was founded in 1987 as a pure-play semiconductor foundry, a novel concept at the time. The idea was to focus solely on manufacturing chips for other companies, unlike other integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel, which designed and made their own chips. This model enabled TSMC to become a dedicated partner to many fabless companies, facilitating specialization in manufacturing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

## Strategic Foundation and Initial Challenges

Establishing TSMC required convincing the Taiwanese government to invest in this [[challenges_and_advice_for_company_founders | new model]], advocated by Chang through a simple but effective pitch to focus solely on manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:18">[02:22:18]</a>. While the initial years saw TSMC manufacturing excess capacity of IDMs, the real vision was always to prepare for an inevitable rise in fabless companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>.

## Embracing the Learning Curve

Chang implemented strategies learned from his time at TI, including adopting the [[learning_curve_and_pricing_strategies_in_the_semiconductor_manufacturing_industry | learning curve principle]]—lowering prices early to secure large volumes and eventually attaining a cost advantage due to economies of scale. This foresight is central to how TSMC scaled its operations while maintaining profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:35">[02:38:35]</a>.

## Key Relationships and Market Positioning

One of Chang's significant moves was forging a strong relationship with [[nvidias_history_and_strategic_decisions | Nvidia]]. This began when Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, wrote a letter to TSMC in 1997 detailing Nvidia's need for a foundry capable of manufacturing their pioneering chips. Morris Chang's decision to pursue this potential client was a pivotal moment in TSMC's history, eventually making Nvidia one of its largest customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Culmination of a Vision

Through [[key_partnerships_and_decisions_shaping_tsmcs_growth | strategic alliances]] and an unwavering focus on manufacturing excellence, TSMC under Morris Chang became instrumental in the rise of the semiconductor industry, playing an integral role in the success of the global tech ecosystem. The company's ability to focus on manufacturing meant it was not competing with customers, unlike integrated manufacturers. This strategy was not only pioneering but created a new paradigm within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

Today, TSMC stands tall as the [[role_of_tsmc_in_the_semiconductor_industry | world's most valuable semiconductor company]], producing cutting-edge chips used in everything from smartphones to supercomputers. Morris Chang's contributions have made him a revered figure, illustrating how visionary leadership combined with strategic innovation can reshape an entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:04">[02:26:04]</a>.

Chang’s efforts in building a company that adhered to a strict focus on the learning curve, customer-centric manufacturing, and strategic foresight have made TSMC an indispensable powerhouse in global technology.

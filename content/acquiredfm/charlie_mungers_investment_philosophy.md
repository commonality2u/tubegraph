Charlie Munger, alongside his partner [[Influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]], is renowned for his prolific investment career and distinctive approach to the markets. At 99 years old, turning 100 on January 1st, Munger offers a unique perspective on human history and the evolution of investing over nearly a century. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> This article summarizes key tenets of his investment philosophy as discussed in a recent interview.

## Core Investment Principles

### Investing vs. Gambling

Munger draws a clear distinction between investing and gambling. He views much of modern retail stock trading as akin to gambling, where individuals "don't really know anything about the companies" and "just gamble on going up and down price." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> He believes that if he were "running the world," he would impose a tax on short-term gains with no offset for losses, to deter this activity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> His partner [[Influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]] always sought to have the odds in his favor, preferring to be "the house, not the player." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

### The Power of Conviction and "Betting Heavily"

One of Munger's most significant principles is recognizing rare, high-conviction opportunities. He states that there are "maybe five, six times in a lifetime" when you "know you're right and you know you have one that's really going to work wonderfully." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a> When such an opportunity arises and you "know you have an edge," you "should bet heavily." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> He criticizes business schools for not teaching this concept, noting that many investors "go broke because they think it's easy," when in fact, these opportunities are "very hard and rare." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>

Developing this level of conviction requires dedication: "You work at it, you redo a lot of reading and thinking and visiting." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>

### Leverage and Capital-Light Businesses

Munger values businesses that naturally generate cash flow without requiring significant capital reinvestment. He points to Costco as a prime example, where the business model is "capital light" because suppliers wait for payment until after the goods are sold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a> This effectively means Costco operates with "no investment in them" and suppliers carry the inventory burden. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> He considers this a form of "leverage" inherent in the business model, distinct from debt leverage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>

Reflecting on his partnership with [[Influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]], Munger believes they could have achieved "three times as much now" with "a little bit more leverage" without significantly increasing risk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a> However, they prioritized the "safety of his shareholders" above all else. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>

### Buy and Hold Mentality

A cornerstone of Munger's philosophy, exemplified by Berkshire Hathaway, is the "buy and hold" approach. Berkshire's reputation is built on "staying with things" and rarely selling businesses unless they are "problem businesses" that can't be fixed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a> This long-term commitment aligns investor and management interests. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>

### The Challenge of Finding Opportunities Today

Munger believes that finding attractive investment opportunities has become increasingly difficult. He notes that the market is "so far removed from the cigar butt era" and that "everything in the whole world is overpriced." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a> He attributes this to the natural outcome of "human nature and competition," where capital is concentrated in a "very small set of opportunities." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>

While he acknowledges that "somebody will find a few things," he asserts that "it gets harder and harder." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a> He suggests that while there were once "easy" opportunities, "it was never easy thoroughly understood" and "it's harder now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a> The key is to find opportunities where brands lead to pricing power, but these are often "so low I wouldn't even look." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>

## Views on Specific Investment Avenues and Industries

### Venture Capital

Munger is highly critical of the modern [[Venture capital and investing strategies | venture capital]] industry, describing it as "very poorly done." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a> He observes that many founders "hate the Venture capitalists" because they don't feel like partners and believe VCs are "only taking care of themselves." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a> He particularly dislikes the high fees ("2 and 20 or 3 and 30") charged by many funds, arguing that such fees are only justified if "you really are going to achieve very unusual results." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a> He notes that endowments are pushing back on these fee structures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>

### Public Markets and Brands

Munger emphasizes the value of strong brands. He cites See's Candies, an early acquisition, as a prime example of a brand that allowed them to "raise the price every year by 10% and nobody cared." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a> This generated significant profits without requiring new capital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a> He also discusses Kraft Heinz, noting that people are willing to pay more for Heinz ketchup due to its unique flavor, but not for Kraft cheese. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>

When considering investments, Munger generally looks at two types of companies:
1.  **"Cigar butt" companies**: Those that are "really cheap even though it's a crappy company," though he considers these rare. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a> This aligns with [[howard_markss_investment_memos_and_philosophy | Howard Marks]]'s perspective on distressed assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>
2.  **Great companies at the right price**: "Brand companies... if you get them at the right price." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>

### Notable Investments and Observations

*   **Costco**: Munger considers Costco to be one of those rare, wonderful opportunities due to its ability to sell cheaper, operate efficiently, offer wide parking spaces, and implement unique strategies like executive memberships and reward points. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a> He admires its capital-light model and commitment to not raising prices on key items like the hot dog, which has become "half famous." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a> He also notes that the success of Costco is a blend of "culture plus model" and "hardworking determined execution for 40 years." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>
*   **Home Depot**: He views Home Depot as a successful "copy" of the Costco model applied to home improvements. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>
*   **BYD**: Munger sees BYD as a "miracle" company led by a genius engineer who works "70 hours a week" and can "make that part" just by looking at it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a> Despite his initial skepticism about BYD entering the car business, it "worked fabulously well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a> He compares BYD's founder to Elon Musk, noting BYD's founder is "closer to ground zero" and better at "actually making things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>
*   **Japanese Trading Houses**: He describes Berkshire's investment in these companies as a "no-brainer" due to very low interest rates in Japan (half a percent for 10 years) combined with 5% dividends from "entrenched old companies" with valuable assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a> This offered a "huge flow of cash with no investment no thought." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>
*   **Apple**: Munger states that "everybody needs some significant participation in the 12 companies to do better than everybody else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a> Apple was a "logical candidate" when it became "cheap" at "about 10 times earnings" around 2015. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>
*   **China**: Munger maintains a positive long-term view on China, believing the "Chinese economy has better future prospects over the next 20 years than almost any other big economy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a> He also finds that "the leading companies of China are stronger and better than practically any other leading companies anywhere and they're available at a cheaper price." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>

## Broader Reflections

Munger reflects that while he knew investing was hard at 70, he now understands "how hard it is." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a> He attributes extraordinary success to a combination of "very intelligent," "very hard" work, and being "very lucky." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a> He emphasizes that "you only have to get rich once," rather than repeatedly climbing mountains. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>

### On the "Good Old Days"

While acknowledging that some believe earlier times were "the good old days," Munger recalls "sweating blood in some of those good old days," referencing challenges like the Buffalo Evening News and Solomon Brothers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a> He highlights that the newspaper business was once a "gold mine" and the "game in town" was to achieve local monopoly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>

### Dislike for EBITDA

Munger strongly criticizes the use of EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) as a financial metric. He believes it's dishonest, stating, "I think you got a big truck company and take the depreciation out of the trucks out of the earnings you're been lying about the earnings." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a> He views it as a "criminal" concept that allows for "extreme manipulations," similar to how he perceives John Malone's practices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>

## Life and Partnerships

Munger stresses the importance of liking one another and enjoying working together for an enduring partnership. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a> He attributes his enduring partnership with [[Influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]] to their similar attitudes, particularly their shared desire to keep their families safe and do well for investors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a> He notes that successful partnerships often naturally divide tasks based on individual strengths. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>

His philosophy on personal relationships extends to the idea that the "best way to have a great spouse is to deserve one." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a> He also believes in self-insurance once wealthy enough, as paying for insurance means "pay[ing] the your share of their stupidity" and overhead. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a> He states he carries no fire insurance and only auto insurance because it's legally required. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>

Charlie Munger, known for his prolific career as an investor alongside [[Influence of historical figures like Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]], shared insights into his [[investment_philosophy_of_howard_marks_and_andrew_marks | investment philosophy]] and views on the market. At 99 years old, nearing his 100th birthday, Munger offered a unique perspective shaped by nearly a century of observing human history and financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

## Core Investment Principles

Munger's [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investing strategies and approaches]] emphasize conviction, patience, and a deep understanding of businesses:
*   **Bet Heavily on Conviction**
    When an investor knows they have an edge and are "right" about an opportunity, they should "bet heavily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:09">[15:50:09]</a>. He believes this is a rare occurrence, happening "maybe five, six times in a lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:49">[12:50:49]</a>. Most people fail because they think it's easy, when in fact, it's "very hard and rare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:21">[13:01:21]</a>. Developing this conviction requires "a lot of reading and thinking and visiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:51">[16:11:51]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Focus and Patience**
    A fundamental aspect of his philosophy is to avoid short-term speculation and focus on the long-term value of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:57">[23:40:57]</a>. This is exemplified by Berkshire Hathaway's "Buy and Hold" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:57">[23:40:57]</a>.
*   **Quality Businesses Over "Cigar Butts"**
    While Munger acknowledges that he occasionally considers buying "crappy companies" if they are "really cheap" (a "cigar butt" approach), his primary focus is on "grand companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09:07">[45:09:07]</a>. The challenge is acquiring them at the "right price" during the "few rare occasions" when they are "really cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:49:09">[45:49:09]</a>. He believes that "easy money is almost non-existent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:04">[45:34:04]</a>.
*   **The Power of Luck, Hard Work, and Intelligence**
    Achieving unusually good results in [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | investment strategy and decision making]] requires three things: being "very intelligent," working "very hard," and being "very lucky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:07">[39:31:07]</a>. To increase luck, one can "start early and keep trying a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:06">[39:48:06]</a>.

## Critiques of Modern Financial Markets

Munger expressed strong opinions on what he sees as wrong in the global securities markets:
*   **Gambling vs. Investing**
    He views much of modern retail stock trading as akin to gambling, where people "don't really know anything about the companies" and "just gamble on going up and down price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:08">[06:27:08]</a>. He would advocate for a tax on short-term gains with no offset for losses to discourage this behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:15">[06:40:15]</a>.
*   **Algorithmic Trading and Leverage**
    Munger noted that early algorithms, like those at Renaissance, exploited human tendencies to "trend follow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:47">[07:16:47]</a>. He criticized their reliance on "huge leverage" to generate big returns from smaller profits on higher volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:47">[08:11:47]</a>.
*   **Venture Capital (VC)**
    Munger believes [[venture_capital_strategies_and_the_importance_of_optimism | venture capital]] is "very poorly done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:41">[21:04:41]</a>. He highlighted the conflict between founders and VCs, stating that people doing the work often "hate the Venture capitalists" because they feel VCs are "only taking care of themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:58">[22:56:58]</a>. He criticized the high fees ("two points off the top plus the carry") charged by private funds, which enrich managers but often lead to poor returns for endowments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:29">[24:25:29]</a>. He noted that endowments are starting to push back on these fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:43">[25:24:43]</a>.
*   **Capital Saturation and Lack of Easy Opportunities**
    Munger observed that there is "so much capital and so much competition" today, making it "harder and harder" to find attractive opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11:00">[26:11:00]</a>. He suggested that "damn near" everything is overpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:08">[46:46:08]</a>.
*   **Disdain for EBITDA**
    He considers EBITDA to be a "criminal" metric, arguing that it misrepresents earnings by excluding depreciation, especially for capital-intensive businesses like truck companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

## Notable Investments and Business Insights

### Costco
Munger sees Costco as one of the few "one-in-a-lifetime" investment opportunities he's encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:06">[12:45:06]</a>.
*   **Origin**: He was introduced to Price Club founder Sol Price by Rod Hills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:03">[08:43:03]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Costco succeeded by selling "cheaper than anybody else" in "big efficient stores" with ample, wide parking spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:52">[13:08:52]</a>.
*   **Capital Light**: A key virtue is its "capital light business model," where suppliers effectively finance inventory by waiting for payment until after the goods are sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:23">[13:50:23]</a>. They had "no investment" in inventories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:19">[13:54:19]</a>.
*   **Culture and Execution**: Its success is attributed to the "magic of the business model and culture" combined with "very reliable hardworking determined execution for 40 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:24:00">[49:24:00]</a>. A central norm was "don't raise the market" price, keep it "low and keep it there forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a>, exemplified by the unchanging hot dog price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:46:07">[52:46:07]</a>.
*   **Growth Constraints**: Costco's growth rate is naturally limited because opening new stores requires significant effort related to new managers, politics, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:44:09">[50:44:09]</a>.
*   **Target Audience**: Sol Price intentionally sought to attract "the rich man trying to save money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:11:11">[52:11:11]</a>.
*   **China Expansion**: Jim Sinegal initially resisted expanding into China for 30 years after an early experience with a requested bribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:12:00">[51:12:00]</a>.

### Retail Investing (Beyond Costco)
*   **Warren Buffett's Stance**: [[Influence of historical figures like Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]] generally "doesn't like retailing" because "practically everything that was once mighty in retail's gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:07">[10:07:07]</a>, considering it "too damn difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
*   **Diversified Retail**: Munger noted that Berkshire made "nothing but money" in Diversified Retail, but much of it came from buying back their own undervalued stock after a failed acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:01">[10:27:01]</a>. This success led to Blue Chip Stamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:39">[11:29:39]</a>.
*   **Savings and Loan**: An early investment in a small savings and loan company turned a $2 million investment into over $2 billion in marketable securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:31">[11:41:31]</a>.
*   **Copying the Model**: Home Depot and Floor & Decor are examples of businesses that successfully copied aspects of the Costco model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:02">[26:31:02]</a>. Walmart, however, failed to adapt due to being "too wetted by the ideas they already had" and their existing business model of focusing on cheap land in small towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:03">[28:21:03]</a>.

### Brands and Pricing Power
*   **See's Candies**: This first acquisition demonstrated that a strong brand allows for price increases without losing volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:05">[34:06:05]</a>. See's has raised prices by 10% annually for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:54">[34:27:54]</a> and requires "very little new capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:20">[34:36:20]</a>. The opportunity arose because the family needed liquidity to pay death taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:38">[35:07:38]</a>.
*   **Luxury Brands (Hermes, LVMH)**: These companies have durable value due to brands that people "trust so much," which takes "a century to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:32">[33:27:32]</a>.
*   **Kraft Heinz**: Heinz ketchup has pricing power because people are "really willing to change brands" over its flavor, while Kraft cheese does not, as customers are less particular about the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:27">[37:00:27]</a>. This phenomenon applies to other sauces where a particular flavor creates a "trade secret" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:40">[37:40:40]</a>.

### Specific Company Investments
*   **Automotive Industry**: Munger avoids the auto industry due to its difficulty, new capital requirements for electric cars, different selling methods, and tough unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:02">[29:21:02]</a>.
*   **Hyundai**: An investment in Hyundai resulted in a loss, as Munger held out until the price recovered near his original cost before selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:24:26">[30:24:26]</a>.
*   **Japanese Trading Houses**: Described as a "no-brainer" idea that arises "maybe two, three times a century" for someone as smart as [[Michael Mauboussins investment philosophy and background | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:01">[30:46:01]</a>. The opportunity involved borrowing cheaply in Japan (half a percent interest rates) and buying stocks of entrenched companies with 5% dividends, creating a "huge flow of cash with no investment, no thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:04">[30:58:04]</a>. Berkshire's credit allowed them to access this capital, unlike others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:10">[31:39:10]</a>.
*   **Apple**: Munger believes that significant participation in leading companies is necessary to outperform the market. Apple is a "logical candidate" for such a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>. Berkshire invested when Apple became "cheap" at "about 10 times earnings" around 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:12:00">[42:12:00]</a>.
*   **BYD**: Munger considers his investment in BYD to be a "venture capital type investment" even though it was a publicly traded company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:34:04">[55:34:04]</a>. He described BYD's founder as a "genius" engineer who works 70 hours a week and can reverse-engineer parts just by looking at them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>. Munger and Buffett initially tried to dissuade the founder from entering the car business, but he "paid no attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:56:06">[55:56:06]</a>. BYD's aggressive growth and high acceleration cars appeal to young macho males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:40:59">[54:40:59]</a>. Despite early "huge mistakes," they "almost went broke" with their dealership system but were "lucky" to be on the cutting edge of electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:18:28">[56:18:28]</a>.

## Partnership with Warren Buffett
Munger describes his 50-year partnership with [[Influence of historical figures like Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]] as enduring because they "were both similar" in wanting to keep their families safe and do a good job for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:45">[16:41:45]</a>. They shared similar attitudes and continued to have fun throughout the decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:04:00">[58:04:00]</a>. Munger noted that Warren prioritizes the safety of his shareholders above all else, which led to a conservative approach to leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:07">[16:57:07]</a>. While more leverage *could* have led to higher returns, they never wanted to risk "screwing up their basic shelter position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>.

## Reflections and Advice

*   **Difficulty of Investing**: Munger acknowledges that investing money well is "very difficult" and "almost impossible to do time after time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>. He believes it is "so hard" to invest well, and people who claim it's easy often believe their own "self-promotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>.
*   **Operating with Your Own Money**: If given the choice, Munger prefers to "operate with my own money" rather than managing funds for others, primarily for the freedom it provides from dealing with investment bankers, consultants, and VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>.
*   **The Future**: He anticipates that "this craziness in [[venture_capital_and_crossover_investing | Venture Capital]]" will eventually lead to a "stupid" and "natural outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:33:04">[43:33:04]</a>. He also suggested that the current environment, where much capital chases few opportunities, could lead to an "unpleasant blow up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:45">[47:41:45]</a>.
*   **Reputation**: It is crucial to maintain a "good reputation" in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:17:17">[48:17:17]</a>.
*   **Life Advice**: The best way to have a great spouse is to "deserve one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:37">[38:37:37]</a>, emphasizing trust and mutual support in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>.

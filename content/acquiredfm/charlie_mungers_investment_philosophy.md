[[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Charlie Munger]], partner to Warren Buffett, is known for his prolific investing career and his unique perspective on human history and the markets, even at 99 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>. His investment philosophy emphasizes a long-term approach, deep conviction in a few select opportunities, and an aversion to practices he considers akin to gambling.

## Investing vs. Gambling
[[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] strongly distinguishes investing from gambling, viewing activities like sports betting and retail stock trading as gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. He believes that retail stock trading, where people don't know much about the companies and simply "gamble on going up and down price," is poorly organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:31">[06:25:31]</a>. He suggests that if he were "running the world," he would implement a tax on short-term gains with no offset for losses to deter this behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:30">[06:36:30]</a>.

He notes that Warren Buffett, early in his career, always sought situations where the odds were in his favor, akin to being "the house, not the pter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

## Finding and Betting on "Sure Things"
[[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] believes that in a lifetime, an investor might only find five or six opportunities where they are "right" and the investment is "really going to work wonderfully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. When such an opportunity is found, an investor "should bet heavily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. This conviction is developed through extensive reading, thinking, and visiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. He laments that business schools do not teach the principle of betting heavily on one's best ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Costco
[[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] recognized Costco as one of these rare opportunities because they truly sold cheaper than anyone else in America, operated in big, efficient stores, had ample parking, and offered special benefits like reward points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. Their capital-light business model, where suppliers effectively finance inventory until it's sold, was also a key factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Despite the model appearing "pretty obvious," its success lies in "a lot of good execution" and consistent dedication "every day, every week, every year for 40 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>. The culture, especially the "central norm" of keeping prices low forever, contributes significantly to its enduring success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>.

[[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] famously championed Costco, even suggesting he gave too many speeches on its virtues to Warren Buffett's amusement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. He cites Costco's unchanging hot dog price as an example of adhering to a "half famous" strategy that benefits customers and builds loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:46:00">[52:46:00]</a>.

### Case Study: See's Candies
The acquisition of See's Candies for $20 million was a formative experience for [[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] and Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>. They quickly realized they could raise prices by 10% annually without losing customers, generating significant profits without requiring new capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:14:00">[34:14:00]</a>. This demonstrated the power of a strong brand with pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:34:00">[34:34:00]</a>.

## Leverage and Capital Efficiency
[[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] notes that businesses like Costco benefit from an "automatically leveraged" model because they require "no capital" to open new stores and have "no inventories" due to their payment terms with suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>. He distinguishes this from traditional "debt leverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.

While acknowledging that Berkshire Hathaway could have achieved three times more wealth with "a little bit more leverage throughout," [[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] and Buffett prioritized the safety of their shareholders, never wanting to "give them at least chance of screwing up our basic shelter position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.

## Views on Venture Capital and Fees
[[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] has a critical view of venture capital, stating it is "very poorly done" in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>. He highlights that many venture capitalists are disliked by the businesses they fund, who perceive them as only "taking care of themselves" rather than being true partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. He attributes this to the high fee structures (e.g., 2 and 20, or 3 and 30) that attract "the wrong people" who are more focused on generating fees than achieving "very unusual results" for endowments and other capital pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway, in contrast, avoids selling good businesses, even if investment bankers offer high prices, which builds a reputation for "staying with things" and aligns with managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:00">[23:15:00]</a>.

## Modern Investment Landscape
[[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] believes that finding easy investment opportunities is "harder and harder" today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>. He describes the current era as "the opposite of the cigar butt era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>. He acknowledges that the world is "damn near" overpriced, and opportunities are "very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>.

### Key Learnings on Hardness
He reflects that while he knew investing was hard at 70, he now, at 99, understands "how hard it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a>. Success in investing, and life, requires intelligence, hard work, and luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>.

## Specific Investment Examples
*   **Japanese Trading Houses:** [[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] considers Berkshire's investment in Japanese trading houses a "no-brainer" that comes along maybe "two three times a century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43:00">[30:43:00]</a>. With interest rates at half a percent and these entrenched companies paying 5% dividends, it created a "huge flow of cash with no investment no thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>. Only Berkshire's credit and patience allowed them to execute this difficult-to-access opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>.
*   **Apple:** Investing in Apple was a "logical candidate" because "everybody needs some significant participation in the 12 companies to do better than everybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>. Berkshire decided to invest because they "couldn't find anything else" and Apple "got cheap" at around 10 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:05:00">[42:05:00]</a>.
*   **BYD:** [[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] is a "big fan" of BYD, acknowledging its aggressive growth makes him "nervous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07:00">[53:07:00]</a>. He views the investment as a "venture capital type play" that worked fabulously despite initial mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:34:00">[55:34:00]</a>. He describes BYD's founder as a "genius" with a PhD in engineering who can "actually make things with his hands" and execute, contrasting him with Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:00">[56:26:00]</a>.
*   **China:** [[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] maintains an investment position in China, believing its economy has "better future prospects over the next 20 years than almost any other big economy" and its leading companies are "stronger and better" and available at a "cheaper price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:59:00">[43:59:00]</a>. He is comfortable with about 18% of the Munger family portfolio in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:31:00">[44:31:00]</a>.

## Partnership Philosophy
On enduring partnerships, [[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] highlights the importance of liking each other and enjoying working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. He and Warren Buffett shared similar attitudes, prioritizing family safety and doing a good job for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. Partnerships also thrive when individuals are good at different things and naturally divide responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.

## General Advice
[[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] advocates for seeking out two types of companies:
1.  **"Cigar butts"**: Companies that are "really cheap even though it's a crappy company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09:00">[45:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Brand companies**: Companies with strong brands that lead to pricing power, acquired at the "right price" during the "few rare occasions" when they are "really cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:46:00">[45:46:00]</a>.

He emphasizes that success requires intelligence, hard work, and luck, and that one must "start early and keep trying a long time" to potentially get lucky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to "get rich once," not repeatedly climb the mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:29:00">[48:29:00]</a>. He cautions against having a reputation for paying finders fees, as it leads to constant bothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a>.

Regarding family, [[charlie_munger_and_warren_buffetts_philosophies | Munger]] advises getting along with everyone, helping through tough times, and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. The best way to have a great spouse is "to deserve one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.

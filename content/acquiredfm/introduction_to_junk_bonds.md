## What are Junk Bonds?

Junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds, are debt instruments rated below "A" or "Triple B" by investment organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Historically, they were considered "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. At one point, Moody's defined a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Early Market Resistance and Opportunity

When the speaker began managing money in the bond department at Citibank, high-yield bonds were an unrecognized area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Most investment organizations had explicit rules against purchasing bonds rated below A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This rigidity, however, created a unique opportunity due to the lack of other bidders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Open-mindedness and evolving one's thinking were crucial for success in this overlooked market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Historical Context: Michael Milken and the Hickman Book

[[History and Evolution of High Yield Bonds | Michael Milken]] had an early interest in low-rated bonds, even before they were widely recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He reportedly discovered a book by Hickman, which chronicled bond experiences from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This book revealed that the lower a bond's rating, the higher its actual rate of return tended to be, not just its promised yield, but its realized total return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This phenomenon held true even though the period included the Great Depression and associated defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The excess yield offered by these bonds was more than sufficient to offset credit losses, marking an "aha moment" for Milken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: Analyzing Risk

A key principle in investing in high-yield bonds is understanding that the price matters, regardless of perceived quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The speaker employs an analogy with life insurance companies to explain the viability of investing in bonds where some defaults are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>:

*   **Awareness of Risk**: Defaults are an expected part of the investment, not a shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Analyzable Risk**: Like insurance companies assessing health, investors can analyze the risk of default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Diversifiable Risk**: Diversifying across many different high-yield bonds mitigates the impact of individual defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Well-Paid Risk**: The higher yield received from these bonds compensates for the inherent risk of default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, similar to how insurance policies are priced to account for mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

By applying this methodology, investors can make money steadily and safely even by investing in "the worst public companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Contrast with "Nifty Fifty" Stocks

The approach to high-yield bonds stands in stark contrast to the market sentiment surrounding the "Nifty Fifty" stocks of the late 1960s and early 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. These were considered the "best and fastest growing companies in America," where it was believed "nothing bad could ever happen" and "there was no price too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The speaker notes that both extremes—that high-yield bonds are "not appropriate for investment regardless of price" and that "no price [is] too high" for the Nifty Fifty—are incorrect stances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Investors who bought the Nifty Fifty in 1969 and held for five years lost almost all their money, primarily because they were priced too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Companies like IBM, Xerox, and Simplicity Patterns, once considered inviolable, faced significant challenges and disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The "moats" were considered absolute, and the concept of disruption was often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Many of these companies saw losses exceeding 90% from their peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This highlights that even for the best companies, an excessive price can lead to poor investment outcomes.

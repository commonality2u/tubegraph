This article explores the "American Dynamism" thesis, a venture investing and technology vertical led by Katherine Boyle at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). This thesis focuses on fostering [[product_excellence_and_innovation_as_growth_drivers | technological innovation]] within traditional, often physical, sectors that support the national interest and civic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## The American Dynamism Thesis

The "American Dynamism" thesis targets companies that support the national interest, encompassing sectors such as aerospace, defense, education, housing, transportation, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:07">[08:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:30">[09:38:30]</a>. These are critical categories that affect most citizens but have largely been untouched by software innovation over the past 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:09">[08:41:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:03">[08:43:03]</a>. Boyle emphasizes that these sectors, while often government-funded or heavily regulated, are ripe for transformation through technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:50">[10:28:50]</a>.

## Historical Disconnect Between Silicon Valley and Traditional Industries

Historically, modern Silicon Valley developed with a narrative of avoiding government engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:04">[14:47:04]</a>. This contrasts sharply with its origins, where it was built on defense investment and companies like Don Valentine's were selling to the Department of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:09">[15:00:09]</a>. The prevailing wisdom among venture capital firms for decades was that these sectors were "too hard" due to entrenched interests and regulatory complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.

### Obstacles to Innovation

Innovating in physical industries is challenging because they are often not "pure software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:32">[11:03:32]</a>. These sectors:
*   Have long-standing regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:08">[11:16:08]</a>.
*   Are dominated by large, entrenched players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.
*   Require more capital upfront and have longer private periods, going "deeper down the J-curve" for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   Face a government bureaucracy that has been slow to adopt modern software procurement, leading to a "time warp" in daily operations compared to the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.

Boyle notes that industries like healthcare, housing, and education have seen costs rise while other consumer goods have become cheaper, precisely because [[impact_of_technological_change_on_business_durability | technology has not touched these sectors]] sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>.

## The Catalyst for Change: A New Era of Building

The COVID-19 pandemic served as a major impetus for the American Dynamism thesis, highlighting the need for innovation in foundational areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>. Key trends enabling this shift include:

*   **Changing Founder Profile:** Silicon Valley's appeal has broadened beyond traditional computer science graduates. More diverse founders—from former teachers to Department of Defense procurement officers—are now building companies, driven by a desire to solve real-world problems in their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.
*   **Accessibility of Tools:** The cost of starting a startup has decreased tremendously because founders no longer have to build everything from scratch. They can leverage existing tools and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.
*   **Decentralization of Tech:** The remote work movement, accelerated by COVID-19, means founders can build significant companies from anywhere in the country, including second and third-tier cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:38:00">[52:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:00:00">[56:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:16:00">[56:16:00]</a>. This contrasts with the post-war trend of talent centralizing in cities like New York and San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
*   **Shifting Perceptions of "Success":** The "Social Network" era popularized founding, leading to a "young people's revolution" where ambitious individuals seek direct impact as CEOs rather than traditional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>.

## Case Studies of American Dynamism

*   **SpaceX:** An early example of a company that, despite initial fears about investor returns, became one of the most important and largest venture-backed private companies, demonstrating the potential for long-term bets in complex physical domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   **Flock Safety:** An Atlanta-based company that started by selling small, affordable license plate reader cameras to homeowners' associations to help solve local crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>. Its success in solving serious crimes led police departments nationwide to adopt its technology, illustrating how a solution built for a community can scale to address broader civic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:40:00">[54:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>.
*   **Hadrian:** An Los Angeles-based company building automated machine shops for aerospace and defense manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. Its founder, Chris Power, identified the impending crisis from retiring baby boomer machine shop owners and the inability of existing shops to integrate modern software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. Hadrian is creating new, automated factories and upskilling American workers to be technically competent machinists, addressing a critical need for modern defense contractors and the new space sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Anduril:** An early a16z investment that, despite initial unpopularity due to its focus on defense, proved vital as geopolitical events highlighted the need for strong defense capabilities built with modern technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Shifting Paradigms: Abundance vs. Scarcity

Boyle contrasts the cultures of Silicon Valley and Washington D.C., highlighting a fundamental difference in incentives:

*   **Washington D.C. (Culture of Scarcity):** Power is the currency, and it is scarce and hierarchical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. There is a zero-sum mindset where attention and front-page stories are finite resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. [[historical_business_practices_and_corporate_innovation | Traditional industries]] and government have often seen an increase in budget and employees, but the internal bureaucracy resists external software and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Silicon Valley (Culture of Abundance):** Equity and financial success are the currency, and the system encourages growth and creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Founders help other founders, and venture capitalists have portfolios of winners, reflecting a positive-sum mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The driving force is often the desire to create something real and right past wrongs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

The rise of the "creator economy" and platforms like Substack and Shopify exemplifies the new "small business revolution" on the internet, enabling individuals to build new types of businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This "small tech" is focused on solving the country's big problems and creating jobs, a trend that distinguishes it from "big tech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## The Future of American Innovation

Boyle believes that if the American Dynamism thesis succeeds, every venture capital firm will adopt a similar practice, recognizing it as the next major category for [[strategies_for_identifying_and_investing_in_innovative_companies | innovation and investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>. This is not impact investing or ESG, but a source of significant returns and national prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. The goal is to spread the "incentive alignment" and growth culture of Silicon Valley across the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.

> "Nothing is not a tech business anymore." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>

The decentralization of tech, allowing people to work from anywhere, is viewed as a positive development for the country, reversing the brain drain to specific hubs and fostering a renaissance of collaborative building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. This movement represents a return to the roots of American innovation, where "misfits and contrarians" build new things from nothing, driven by the belief in the American dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>.

In its early stages, eBay, initially known as Auction Web, faced a pivotal choice between being acquired by a large corporation or pursuing independent growth with venture capital funding. This decision significantly shaped the company's trajectory and its ultimate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## eBay's Unconventional Beginnings

[[Pierre Omidyars journey from pen computing to founding eBay | Pierre Omidyar]] began tinkering with the early internet in his free time while working full-time as an engineer at General Magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. He launched a collection of internet services he called eBay, short for "electronic Bay Area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Among these services was "Auction Web," which eventually became the core of eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

Initially, Omidyar hosted auctions for free, with no established business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. However, as traffic surged, his server costs "went through the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Reluctantly, Omidyar asked users to pay a small listing fee to cover expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Users responded overwhelmingly, deluging his apartment with checks, demonstrating clear product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This unexpected financial success led him to bring on Jeff Skoll, a newly minted MBA, to manage the influx of payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

If Omidyar hadn't needed to cover server costs, eBay might have remained a non-profit resource like Wikipedia or Craigslist (in its early days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Instead, it became a pioneering e-commerce company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

## Seeking Professional Investment

Despite generating cash flow and being profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, Omidyar, drawing on his experiences from previous companies like Ink and General Magic, recognized the value of venture capitalists (VCs) and a professional board to help scale the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. He and Skoll began pitching to VCs on Sand Hill Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Nearly every VC firm they approached turned them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

### Competing Offers

Only [[Benchmarks investment strategy in eBay | Benchmark]] showed significant interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Benchmark, led by partners Bruce Dunleavy, Bob Kagle, David Beirne, Kevin Harvey, and Andy Rachleff, offered eBay a Series A financing round of \$6.7 million at a \$20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

However, Omidyar and Skoll also had another compelling offer: an acquisition bid from Knight Ridder, a major newspaper conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Knight Ridder, recognizing eBay's online classifieds potential, offered \$50 million for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. This was a substantial sum, especially for a two-person company that was barely formalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. At this time, eBay was experiencing rapid growth, expanding at 10% month-over-month, and was already profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### The Role of Secondary Transactions

A key aspect of the decision-making process, and a point of some historical debate, involves whether Benchmark structured the deal to include "equity-backed loans" or "secondary" transactions to Omidyar and Skoll. It was reported by *The Washington Post* and in SEC filings that Benchmark made equity-backed loans of \$750,000 each to Omidyar and Skoll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This effectively acted as a secondary payment, incentivizing them not to accept Knight Ridder's \$50 million acquisition offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. While the exact amount and nature of these personal payments are debated, with some accounts suggesting up to 50% of the investment round was used for a secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>, it seems likely that some form of financial comfort was provided to the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. This allowed the entrepreneurs to take some money off the table and commit to growing the company, rather than selling it outright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. Such a deal structure was highly untraditional and non-consensus at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

## Outcome

The deal with Benchmark was finalized in the summer of 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. Just over a year later, in September 1998, eBay went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. This rapid success was significantly bolstered by [[Meg Whitmans leadership and eBays IPO success | Meg Whitman]] joining as CEO, recruited by Benchmark and David Beirne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

At the time of eBay's IPO, Benchmark's \$6.7 million investment was worth \$400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. By the time their lockup expired in spring 1999, less than two years after the investment, their stake had surged to over \$4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. This represented an extraordinary 47x return on their \$85 million fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. If the secondary kicker of an additional \$1.5 million to the founders was indeed incremental, it could have added another \$1 billion to Benchmark's returns, an additional 12x on the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. Benchmark eventually distributed \$4 billion to its limited partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. This monumental success underscored the wisdom of choosing growth over an early exit, especially with a partner willing to structure a deal that supported the founders' long-term commitment.

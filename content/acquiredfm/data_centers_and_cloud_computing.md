[[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia's]] journey into the data center and [[cloud_computing | cloud computing]] space represents a significant evolution from its origins as a consumer graphics company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:50">[07:01:50]</a>. This shift was driven by the realization that future computing would increasingly be separated from the viewing device, leading to an explosion of market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>.

## Evolution Towards Data Centers

The fundamental insight that spurred [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia's]] entry into data centers, approximately 17 years ago, was the belief that limiting their technology to computers physically connected to a monitor would restrict their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a>.

Early steps in this direction included:
*   **Cloud Gaming (GeForce Now - GFN)**: This product, which captures a frame buffer, encodes it into video, and streams it to a viewing device, marked [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia's]] first [[cloud_computing | cloud computing]] product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:59:00">[35:59:00]</a>. GFN involved tackling challenges like the speed of light and latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>.
*   **Remote Graphics**: This involved placing [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia's]] GPUs in enterprise data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:26:00">[36:26:00]</a>.
*   **GPU Supercomputers**: The combination of Cuda and GPUs transformed them into supercomputers, further expanding their data center offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:33:00">[36:33:00]</a>.

This progression allowed [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia]] to overcome the physical limitations of desktop PCs and single GPUs per person, enabling their technology to be enjoyed irrespective of its physical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>. This groundwork in data center computers was crucial for [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia's]] later success in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Data Center Development

The rise of AI, particularly deep learning and large language models, significantly shaped the trajectory of data centers.

### The Universal Function Approximator
[[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia]] recognized the "incredible effectiveness" of deep learning, particularly after AlexNet's breakthrough in computer vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. They observed that deep learning constituted a "universal function approximator" capable of solving a vast array of problems where predictability, rather than causality, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. This includes applications from predicting toothpaste preferences to weather patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:42]</a>. This insight suggested that nearly every piece of software would eventually be programmed this way, necessitating a fundamental change in how computers and chips are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

### From Hyperscale to Distributed Computing
Traditional [[cloud_computing | cloud computing]] models, often called "hyperscale," focused on virtualizing many users onto commodity components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:02:00">[41:02:00]</a>. However, AI workloads, especially large training jobs, require "distributed computing," orchestrating a single job across millions of processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a>. This distinction highlighted the need for specialized networking solutions beyond standard Ethernet, which is suitable for Hadoop or search queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:25:00">[41:25:00]</a>.

## High-Performance Networking: The Mellanox Acquisition

The acquisition of Mellanox was a strategic decision driven by the understanding that a data center's defining characteristic is its networking infrastructure, not just its processing chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:00">[40:07:00]</a>. Jensen Huang realized that to be a data center-oriented company, [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia]] needed to excel in networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:52:00">[40:52:00]</a>.

Mellanox, as a leading high-performance networking company, provided expertise in Infiniband, which was ideal for the "inverse of hyperscale" distributed computing required by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:45:00">[41:45:00]</a>. This acquisition is considered one of the best in technology history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:22:00">[42:22:00]</a>. It positioned [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia]] to capitalize on the impending explosion of large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:43:00">[42:43:00]</a>.

## Current Landscape: AI Cloud Providers

The demand for high-performing GPUs for AI workloads has led to a noticeable scarcity of [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia]] GPUs in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:03:00">[44:03:00]</a>. Cloud providers like Crusoe have emerged to specifically address this need, offering [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia's]] A100s and H100s at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:16:00">[44:16:00]</a>.

Crusoe's strategy involves:
*   Utilizing the best GPU hardware, like [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia]]'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:23:00">[44:23:00]</a>.
*   Investing heavily in an optimized [[cloud_computing | cloud computing]] software stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>.
*   Running their cloud on wasted, stranded, or clean energy, which provides significantly better performance per dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>.

Customers are already running large-scale generative AI workloads on clusters of [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia]] H100 GPUs, interconnected with 3200 Gbit Infiniband and leveraging Crusoe's network-attached block storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:35:00">[44:35:00]</a>.

## Future Opportunities

The market for "manufacturing of intelligence" and "generative intelligent work" is enormous, measured in trillions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. By separating itself from being just a chip company and building upon its core technology to become an AI company, [[Nvidias expansion into data centers and gaming | Nvidia]] has seen its market opportunity grow by a thousand times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>. This suggests that technology companies will become much larger in the future as they produce something "very different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>.

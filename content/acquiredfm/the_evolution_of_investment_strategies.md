From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The investment landscape has undergone significant transformation, moving from traditional value-based approaches to more dynamic, growth-oriented and tech-focused strategies. This evolution is explored through the differing yet complementary perspectives of legendary value investor Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, and his son Andrew Marks, co-founder of TQ Ventures. Their insights, particularly from their co-authored memo "Something of Value," highlight the need for adaptability and open-mindedness in a rapidly changing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Traditional Investment Strategies: Value and High-Yield

Howard Marks' career began in equity research at [[Investment Strategies at Citibank | Citibank]] from 1969 to 1978, during an era when the "Nifty Fifty"—companies considered the best and fastest-growing in America—dominated the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a>. These companies were often priced with "no price too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, leading to significant losses for investors who held them for extended periods, despite their perceived quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Howard notes that the concept of disruption was largely absent from the thinking of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

After leaving equities, Howard ventured into the then-"backwater" of high-yield bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a>. At the time, low-rated bonds were considered "not proper for investment regardless of price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This prejudice, combined with ignorance, created market inefficiencies where mispricing occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Howard's success in this area stemmed from understanding that high-yield bonds, much like life insurance, price in the risk of default, and the excess yield compensates for potential credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Growth and Tech Investing

Andrew Marks' journey in investing began by "parroting" his father's value-investing principles and studying Warren Buffett's letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. However, he evolved to focus on growth companies, particularly in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. He observed that while traditional value investing focuses on current cash flows, growth investing considers reinvestment of those cash flows at high rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

### Amazon: A Case Study in Growth

Amazon serves as a prime example of this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. A traditional value investor might have dismissed Amazon due to its historical lack of income statement profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. However, Andrew highlights its "favorable cash conversion cycle" and the importance of betting on a visionary founder like Jeff Bezos, who could leverage the initial retail business into new value-creating ventures like AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This demonstrates a move from solely fundamental analysis to recognizing the [[the_influence_of_intangible_assets_on_modern_investment_strategies | influence of intangible assets]] and optionality that comes with strong management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### The Impact of Disruption and Technology

The world's consistent backdrop, which characterized Howard's early career, has given way to rapid and continuous change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Industries once thought impregnable, like newspapers, have been decimated by disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This acceleration of technological adoption means businesses are less durable without constant evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

While this increased uncertainty might suggest companies should be worth less, the ability to leverage competitive advantages to enter adjacent and global markets means there's also "much more value creation to be had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have demonstrated increasing returns to scale due to new distribution models and the ability to dominate vast markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Core Principles in Evolving Investment

### Open-Mindedness and Flexibility

A crucial theme from Howard and Andrew's discussion is the importance of avoiding rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Going against consensus, as Howard did with high-yield bonds, can lead to opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The investment community often falls into "knee-jerk reactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> based on superficial knowledge, highlighting the need to "really get deep" into understanding investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### The Shift in Information Advantage

In the past, information about companies was scarce, giving investors like Warren Buffett an advantage by diligently researching and finding "hidden value" in plain sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Today, information is "totally ubiquitous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, with algorithms and machine learning making markets more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

This means that "readily available quantitative information about the present" no longer provides a competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Instead, the advantage lies in making "qualitative judgments about the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, which computers are not yet adept at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

### [[Investment strategy and personality alignment | Investment Strategy and Personality Alignment]]

Both Howard and Andrew emphasize the importance of aligning one's [[finding_the_right_investment_strategy_for_individual_skill_sets | investment strategy]] with their personality and skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

*   Howard, a conservative personality, found success in credit investing where predictability was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   Andrew, on the other hand, gravitated toward early-stage [[venture_capital_investment_strategies | venture capital]], where success relies on making long-term qualitative judgments about future potential and embracing a probabilistic endeavor where most investments might fail, but a few generate outsized returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This approach suits his optimistic and future-oriented mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## The Art of Selling

The decision of when to sell is as critical as when to buy, yet less discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Howard notes a common, often misguided, tendency to sell based on price action (up or down) rather than the underlying fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This is often driven by the desire to avoid regret or embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

Andrew argues that selling decisions should be based on a deep understanding of *why* the investment was made, how things have evolved, and the opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. For "compounding certificates" (companies that can compound cash flows for decades), selling early can be a "colossal mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. These "truly generational companies" are rare but immensely valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Judgment and Unconventional Thinking

Ultimately, success in investment, particularly in evolving markets, comes down to judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This "second-level thinking" involves thinking differently and more correctly than the consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

It requires a combination of:
*   **Deep knowledge and understanding:** Knowing what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Rationality:** The ability to think logically rather than emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Self-awareness:** Recognizing and managing one's biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Intellectual humility:** Acknowledging the possibility of being wrong and knowing one's limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Unconventionality:** Being willing to do things that are "uncomfortably idiosyncratic" and go against the herd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Firm Building and Long-Term Vision

Building an investment firm requires a different skill set from being a great investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Howard attributes Oaktree's success to creating a strong culture, having partners with "shared values and complementary skills," and focusing on client relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

Andrew's firm, TQ Ventures, takes a "totally opposite" approach to firm building, focusing intensely on achieving "world-class returns" by supporting founders and building strong relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. They prioritize investing over management and do not seek to become a large asset manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

Both firms also demonstrate a nuanced approach to fundraising: Oaktree strategically increases its AUM during "bad times" when investment opportunities are ripe, and then reduces fund sizes in subsequent, more expensive periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This counter-cyclical approach underscores a deep understanding of market dynamics, which is a core tenet of their [[investment_philosophies_and_business_strategies | investment philosophies and business strategies]].

## Conclusion

The evolution of [[Investment philosophies and business strategies | investment strategies]] underscores a continuous movement from rigid, quantitative analysis of the present to flexible, qualitative judgments about an uncertain future. Success increasingly depends on the ability to understand complex dynamics, embrace unconventional thinking, align strategies with personal strengths, and cultivate deep relationships within chosen markets. The discussions between Howard and Andrew Marks highlight that while methods change, the underlying principles of disciplined thought, adaptability, and judgment remain paramount.

The podcast hosts, Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, discuss the role of venture capital in society and the challenges it faces with investor Charlie Munger. Munger shares his perspective on the industry, its practices, and how it compares to the investment philosophy of Berkshire Hathaway.

## The Legitimate Business of Venture Capital

Charlie Munger acknowledges that venture capital can be a "very legitimate business if you do it right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:57">[02:28:57]</a>. The ideal approach involves empowering the right people, nurturing them, and helping them run their businesses without over-interfering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:32">[02:33:32]</a>.

## Challenges and Criticisms of Venture Capital

Munger believes the role of [[venture_capital_and_hedge_funds | venture capital]] is "very poorly done" in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:09">[02:04:09]</a>. He highlights several issues:

### Gambling vs. Investing
For many, retail stock trading is akin to gambling because people "don't really know anything about the companies or anything, they just gamble on going up and down price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:35">[06:30:35]</a>. Munger notes that some venture capital deals get "so hot" that participants are "all just sort of gambling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>.

### Fee Structures and Misaligned Incentives
Munger criticizes the common fee structures, such as "two points off the top plus the [carry]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>, or "2 and 20 or 3 and 30" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:22">[02:59:22]</a>. He argues that managers "make very handsome loadings themselves" while endowments, which are large pools of capital, "are not getting a good return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:46">[02:30:46]</a>. He states that one shouldn't charge an extra point unless one "really are going to achieve very unusual results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:07">[02:49:07]</a>.

### Relationship with Founders
A significant criticism is the dynamic between [[venture_capital_investment_strategies | venture capital]] firms and the businesses they invest in. Munger observes that "people in the business doing the work... more than not they hate the Venture capis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:04">[02:56:04]</a>. They often feel that VCs are "only taking care of themselves" and "not trying to help them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. He asserts that many VCs "make money by screwing their investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>.

### Attracting the "Wrong People"
The ease with which good results are *promised* rather than *achieved* in venture capital "attracts the wrong people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Many who have made the most money in [[venture_capital_investment_strategies | venture capital]] behave "a lot like investment bankers deciding which hot new area they're going to get in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, rather than being "great investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Difficulty and Oversupply of Capital
Munger emphasizes that it is "very difficult to invest money well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:53">[02:40:53]</a> and "impossible to do Time After Time After Time in [[venture_capital_investment_strategies | Venture Capital]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:49">[02:47:49]</a>. He notes that the investing world is "so far removed from the cigar butt era" and is now in the "opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:11">[02:16:11]</a>. There is "so much capital and so much competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:44">[02:10:44]</a>, making it "harder and harder" to find opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:28">[02:22:28]</a>. The "low hanging fruit" is "very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>, and "easy money is almost non-existent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: A Contrast

Munger contrasts the venture capital model with Berkshire Hathaway's approach:

### Long-Term Commitment
Unlike venture capitalists who might "discard [companies] to the highest bid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>, Berkshire Hathaway has a reputation for "staying with things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:11">[02:37:11]</a> and "never sell[ing] anything" if it's a "halfway decent business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:32">[02:33:32]</a>. This "Buy and Hold" demonstration aligns investors with managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.

### Operating with Own Money
Munger prefers to "operate with [his] own money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a> rather than being in the "3 and 30 business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:04">[03:46:04]</a>. He states that the "point of getting rich is you don't have to need other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:19">[03:51:19]</a> like investment bankers or consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:04">[03:57:04]</a>.

### Focus on Conviction
Success in any asset class, including [[venture_capital_investment_strategies | venture capital]], comes down to "a few really good decisions with high conviction over an entire career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:35">[04:32:35]</a>. If you "know you have an edge you should bet heavily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:15">[04:50:15]</a>. However, it's not "smoothed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:50">[04:42:50]</a>; there's "no asset class where you can repeatedly just do okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:50">[04:42:50]</a>.

## Notable "Venture Capital Type Investments"

Munger considers Berkshire's investment in BYD a "venture capital type investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:55">[05:34:55]</a>, even though it was a thinly traded public company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. Despite Munger advising against BYD entering the car business, it "worked fabulously well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a> due to the founder's genius and aggressive execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:42">[05:46:42]</a>.

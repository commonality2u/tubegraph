In the latest episode of the Acquired podcast, hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal reflect on the growth of their podcast and discuss audience engagement tactics. This discussion provides valuable insights into how podcasts can attract and retain listeners in an increasingly crowded media landscape.

## Doubling Audience Size

Over the past year, Acquired has seen its audience double, which has been a consistent trend since the podcast's inception seven years ago. This steady growth is attributed to the podcast's ability to form deep connections with its listeners, encouraging loyalty and discussion around each episode.

> Despite only doubling each year, if sustained over a longer period, these numbers become significant. This gradual approach has seen Acquired reach over a quarter-million listeners as of 2022, which was just 62,000 two years prior [01:00:00](#t=01:00:00).

## Algorithm-Free Growth

A significant factor in Acquired's growth has been its reliance on word-of-mouth and organic sharing, rather than algorithms. Because podcasts operate in an open ecosystem, they don’t benefit from the same algorithmic boosts as social media platforms. This means growth is more sustainable and less volatile, relying instead on consistent content quality and audience engagement.

> For example, their notable episodes such as the Amazon episode marked a step change in listener numbers, which then led to stable increases in subsequent episodes [[amazons_early_growth_and_business_strategy | Amazon episode marked a step change in listener numbers]] [01:00:52](#t=01:00:52).

## Audience Engagement: The Essential Ingredient

The hosts emphasize the quality of their audience rather than just sheer numbers. They express satisfaction that their audience composition has remained consistent even as their reach expanded. This consistency suggests that they're continuing to attract the types of listeners they initially intended to reach.

> Ben Gilbert stated, "Wildly relieved this year that the audience mix stayed mostly the same" despite the significant increase in numbers [01:08:02](#t=01:08:02).

## Monetization Strategy

Unlike many other podcasts, Acquired's business model is heavily focused on forming long-term, meaningful relationships with sponsors and partners. Sponsors are carefully selected to ensure alignment with the show's values and audience interests. This approach has allowed Acquired to build deeper connections with its sponsors, many of whom become more than just business partners.

> For example, Acquired hosts have even invested in some of their sponsors, such as Vanta and Modern Treasury, developing firm connections with the companies [[security_and_compliance_with_vanta | Vanta]] [01:10:07](#t=01:10:07).

## Challenges of Podcast Shareability

Ben and David pondered the inherent difficulty in sharing podcasts compared to written or visual content. Without a built-in platform to facilitate easy sharing, podcasts rely more on audience-driven promotion. Their preferred method is using the Acquired website as a central platform, where each episode is accompanied by detailed show notes and transcripts.

> "Podcasts are great because they're really sticky, but they're terrible to grow," mentioned by Ben, illustrating how podcasts, while forming dedicated communities, present challenges in expanding those communities through traditional means [01:02:40](#t=01:02:40).

## Conclusion

In closing, the hosts emphasized that while they are gratified by the show’s growth, they prioritize maintaining a consistent, engaged listener base over sheer numbers. Their deliberate approach to show content, sponsor alignment, and audience engagement is a model for sustainable podcast success.

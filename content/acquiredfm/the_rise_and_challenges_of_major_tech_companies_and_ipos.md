The podcast "Acquired" delves into the stories and playbooks behind [[history_and_strategy_of_great_technology_companies | great technology companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In a year-end recap, the hosts discussed the broader tech markets and economy in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> and looked ahead to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Markets and Companies

The internet has played a significant role in enabling massive scale for artists and companies, as seen with Taylor Swift, who is considered the first truly big internet rockstar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This phenomenon is driven by the internet's ability to create larger markets than previously imaginable, even for niche products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The internet also facilitates the disintermediation or reduction of power for middlemen, allowing more value to accrue directly to creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Walmart is highlighted as an early example of an applied technology company in an established sector, transforming retail by leveraging technology to create a more efficient supply chain and lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. This efficiency enabled them to reach more customers and maintain better financial performance compared to non-tech-enabled incumbents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

The App Store's launch is discussed as a moment where the potential for massive markets was unclear at the time, only becoming obvious in retrospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Similarly, recent advancements in AI, such as DALL-E 2, GPT-3, and ChatGPT, are seen as powerful proof-of-concepts, with their full market implications still largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Nvidia's early investment in AI and CUDA, years before the market fully materialized, is presented as an example of a successful long-term bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Strategy in Tech

### Public Markets and IPOs
The hosts noted their past coverage of the [[public_markets_innovations_including_direct_listings_and_spacs | Google IPO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. They also discussed the current state of IPO and M&A markets, stating they are "effectively closed right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:40">[01:55:40]</a>. This impacts businesses that may not be a fit for venture capital but could be viable, profitable ventures if run differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>.

### Corporate Strategy and Growth
Companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle represent major tech players with rich histories for "Acquired" to cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. The podcast aims to cover one such "Fang" company per year, acknowledging that a proper deep dive might take three or more episodes due to their long histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.

The 2022 funding environment emphasized "revenue growth from secure trusted sources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This led to increased scrutiny and higher expectations for startups regarding security and compliance, as larger companies are only as secure as their vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Compliance certifications help startups gain credibility and sell to larger enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The discussion around Twitter highlighted the challenge of covering companies embroiled in constant drama rather than pure business stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>. While the potential for a company to operate with 80% fewer employees is interesting, the current public narrative around Twitter leans more towards "TMZ story" than a business case study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. Similarly, FTX was not covered in real-time due to the extensive existing reporting and the podcast's focus on evergreen content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a>.

The podcast's approach to content creation emphasizes strategy as making intentional tradeoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. This includes limiting content frequency to allow for deep research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>, producing long episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>, and focusing on a niche audience rather than mass appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. This deliberate strategy, including a "too hard pile" for projects that don't align with their core values, has been instrumental in the show's growth and deep engagement with its audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

The partnership and investment model with sponsors, where the hosts personally invest in companies they feature, allows for deeper insights and first-party perspectives that enhance the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. This creates a feedback loop where business engagement informs the podcast content and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. The podcast acknowledges that its [[the_evolution_of_venture_capital_and_public_markets | business model]] allows for growth that is not solely tied to audience size, differentiating it from creator models that rely on direct monetization of mass consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.

Firms can cultivate new traditions and practices inspired by historical figures, leading to deeply embedded habits that foster their core purpose. Benchmark Capital, for instance, developed a unique dinner tradition influenced by the practices of Benjamin Franklin and the philosophical ideas of William James <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Genesis: Inspired by Benjamin Franklin

The idea for the Benchmark dinners originated from Bill Gurley, who had read a biography of Benjamin Franklin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Franklin was known for hosting four dinners a week, where participants would delve deeply into various subjects such as finance, chemistry, and life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This concept served as a catalyst for Bill to suggest incorporating similar dinners into Benchmark's practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The firm began with a "playful experiment" of a few dinners, including a significant one at the end of 2006 or 2007, which was the first year for one of the partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This initial event, attended by four outside guests—Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos—was described as "electric," creating a memorable experience where "time stood still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Philosophy of Habits and Curiosity

The underlying philosophy for these dinners posits that firms are fundamentally "a collection of habits," a concept borrowed from William James, considered a great American thinker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. According to this view, humans are an "amalgamation of our habits," and habits are crucial for developing character and everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

For Benchmark, nurturing curiosity is the "essential lifeblood of the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Regular Monday meetings, while helpful, were limited in their dynamic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The dinners provide an open-ended, no-agenda environment for "wild explorations of the most bizarre things your partners might be curious about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This tradition honors the firm's purpose of constant learning and activating collective curiosity, fostering "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved in one-on-one settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## The Unique Table Design

A critical element of the [[the_significance_of_benchmark_dinners | Benchmark dinners]] is the specially designed table, which addresses inherent power structures in traditional meeting arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

*   **Problem with traditional tables:** Rectangular tables carry embedded power structures, while circular tables can atomize the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Design inspiration:** The initial inspiration came from Jean-Marie Masoud, a French designer, for an organic table that could expand, collapse, and most importantly, deconstruct power centers to create a non-hierarchical, intimate construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Final design:** The table was ultimately designed by Ole Lundberg based on a hand sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Functionality:** This unique table design prevents sidebar conversations because everyone can hear everything, fostering "one conversation" where the entire group is tuned into the discussion, whether it's good, bad, or tough news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This contrasts sharply with some older venture capital practices where pre-selling deals in side conversations was common before official partner meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Esteemed Guests and Impact

The dinners frequently include esteemed guests beyond the five partners, often individuals with whom Benchmark has not worked or invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Notable attendees have included Dylan Field, Toby from Shopify, and even Jeff Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. While the table itself is not portable, dinners have taken place in other locations like Seattle and L.A. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

> [!INFO] Guest Impact
> The dinners are considered a significant gift, offering "the spotlight of attention" to guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Encountering individuals like Dylan Field can be a transformative experience, where partners feel "swept off your feet" and reminded of the firm's purpose: "this is why we exist to serve people like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

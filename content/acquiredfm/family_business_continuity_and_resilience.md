Hermès, a company founded in Paris, France, in 1837, stands as the oldest story featured on Acquired, predating even Standard Oil or The New York Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. After 187 years, the luxury brand remains under family control, with its sixth generation of family leadership currently at the helm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This extraordinary longevity and continued independence, especially when compared to other luxury brands that have merged into conglomerates, highlights Hermès' unique approach to [[building_and_maintaining_business_resilience | business resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>.

## Generations of Leadership and Craft

The tradition of family involvement and apprenticeship has been a cornerstone of Hermès' enduring success. From the second generation onwards, each leader, including Charles-Émile Hermès, who took over in 1878, apprenticed within the business, learning the craft firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. This practice continues today: the current CEO, Axel Dumas, and artistic director, Pierre-Alexis Dumas (both sixth-generation descendants), apprenticed in the workshops as teenagers for five years after school, mastering the "saddle stitch" and creating items with their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. This deep immersion in the craft differentiates Hermès from conglomerates like LVMH, where executives typically learn the business side rather than the artisanal skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.

This [[family_dynamics_and_the_corporate_structure_of_porsche | family dynamics and the corporate structure]] ensures that the business and the craft remain intimately intertwined, a critical "Playbook theme" for Hermès <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. The knowledge and technique ("savoir-faire") are transmitted from one artisan to another, and from one generation of the family to the next, just as it was from father to son at the company's founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>. This deliberate transmission of knowledge is how Hermès scales production, maintaining its unique artisanal quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

## Navigating Existential Threats

Hermès' history is marked by instances where generational transfers occurred during periods of existential threat to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>. Yet, each succeeding generation has managed to rally and transform the business.

### The Automobile Era Transition
Emile Hermès, representing the third generation, recognized the coming age of the automobile after visiting Henry Ford's factories in the United States in 1916 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. While his brother Adolf wished to remain solely in the horse market, Emile bought him out in 1919, believing in his ability to lead the company's transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This led to the creation of accessories for cars, transforming Hermès into a purveyor of leather bags, a move that would prove crucial for its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This demonstrates the [[importance_of_adapting_business_strategies | importance of adapting business strategies]] in response to market changes.

### The Post-1970s Revival
By the late 1970s, Hermès faced hard times, with consultants even recommending outsourcing production and increasing product lines to lower prices, akin to competitors like Gucci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. However, Jean-Louis Dumas, the fifth-generation leader, who had experience working at Bloomingdale's in the U.S., rejected these recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>. Instead, he repositioned the brand to be relevant to a younger audience by launching an ad campaign showing young Parisian women wearing Hermès scarves with jeans, essentially creating a "not your mother's Tiffany" moment without explicitly stating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>. This strategic pivot, while maintaining the same products and craftsmanship, was key to Hermès' revitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a>. Jean-Louis also oversaw the internationalization of the brand, expanding its client base globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:59">[02:05:59]</a>. Under his tenure, annual revenue grew from less than $100 million to $2 billion by 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:12">[02:06:12]</a>.

## Defending Independence: The LVMH Takeover Attempt

In 2010, Bernard Arnault's LVMH quietly amassed a significant stake in Hermès using equity swap derivatives, eventually controlling 22.6% of the company by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:39">[02:31:39]</a>. This move inflated Hermès' stock price, tempting family members with increased liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:28">[02:32:28]</a>.

However, the Hermès family demonstrated remarkable unity and [[proactively_turning_challenges_into_opportunities | resilience and optionality in investment]]. In 2011, over 50 of the 80 family members contributed 50.2% of their equity into a new cooperative vehicle called H51, contractually agreeing that these shares could not be sold for at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:02">[02:34:02]</a>. This "Ironclad" agreement ensured that LVMH, or any other entity, could never gain control of Hermès <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:02">[02:39:02]</a>. This extraordinary coordination, especially in the face of a tempting multi-billion-dollar offer, solidified the family's commitment to maintaining their independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>.

## Scaling Artisanal Production and Future Outlook

The current generation, led by Axel and Pierre-Alexis Dumas, has refined Hermès' strategy to scale handcrafted artisanal production, a seemingly oxymoronic task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:38">[02:43:38]</a>. Hermès currently employs 7,000 master craftspeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:16">[02:46:16]</a>. They deliberately limit each production site to no more than 250-300 craftspeople, believing that this allows everyone to know each other by name, preventing the shift from a "workshop" to a "factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>.

To meet demand while adhering to these constraints, Hermès has built its own training pipeline for artisans, opening trade schools in rural areas with high unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:20">[02:48:20]</a>. They guarantee jobs to graduates and aim to increase production capacity by 7% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:21">[02:47:21]</a>. Today, the average age of an Hermès artisan is 30, and 80% are women, a significant transformation from previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>. This unique model of "scaling horizontally" with decentralized workshops is akin to a [[cloud_infrastructure_and_investment_strategies | cloud infrastructure and investment strategies]] approach, but applied to human craftsmanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:17">[02:50:17]</a>.

Hermès' adherence to its core principles of craftsmanship, exclusivity, and a unique shopping experience has allowed it to defy conventional [[business_strategy_and_impact_of_technology | business strategy and impact of technology]] and maintain high profit margins without mass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:20">[03:44:20]</a>. They have managed to scale "the old way," preserving their heritage while achieving remarkable financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:19">[03:46:19]</a>.

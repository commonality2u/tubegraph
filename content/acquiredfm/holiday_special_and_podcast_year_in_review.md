The 2023 holiday special of Acquired, featuring hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, presents both a celebratory reflection on the year's achievements and a strategic look at what’s in store for the future. Having built a podcast empire centered on unraveling the stories of great companies, Ben and David are keen to relate how the past year’s experiences have shaped the podcast and its aspirations for the upcoming year.

## A Year of Expansion and Diversification

In 2023, Acquired saw significant growth, both in scope and audience. The podcast, which originally focused on technology companies, broadened its horizons by delving into various sectors, such as luxury, retail, and beyond. This expansion reflects the hosts' evolving interests and the vast array of engaging company stories available worldwide. Ben notes this evolution as a natural extension of their interests, emphasizing a diverse selection of topics as the driver for growth, rather than explicit growth goals [00:02:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">00:02:26</a>).

Acquired episodes, although longer than those seen in the typical podcast landscape, have managed to capture dedicated listener attention, now boasting a half-million-strong audience, effectively doubling their reach from the previous year [00:09:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">00:09:43</a>). This feat highlights both the depth and appeal of their content.

## Embracing Strategic Partnerships

Alongside audience growth, the year also allowed Acquired to engage with new and larger sponsors, including Fortune 500 companies like JP Morgan and ServiceNow [01:04:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">01:04:01</a>). These partnerships underscore the [[importance_of_partnerships_in_business | podcast’s reputation and the substantial reach]] it offers within the business and technology community. Despite entering into partnerships with larger entities, the hosts maintain a commitment to their existing fans and communities, ensuring that quality content remains the core focus.

Ben and David also explored ways to make efficient investments through Acquired, considering the show's influence and existing relationships. This was highlighted as a strategic maneuver to invest in impactful tech companies they feature and partner with [01:08:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">01:08:57</a>).

## Strategy for 2024

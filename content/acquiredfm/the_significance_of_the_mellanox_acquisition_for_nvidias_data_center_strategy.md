NVIDIA's journey to becoming a dominant force in the data center market, particularly for [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI and machine learning]] workloads, was significantly shaped by a long-term strategic vision and culminated in key acquisitions like Mellanox. This evolution involved anticipating future opportunities and positioning the company to capitalize on emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.

## Evolution of NVIDIA's Data Center Focus

NVIDIA's focus on the data center began nearly two decades ago, around 17 years prior to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. The core insight was that the physical connection of NVIDIA's technology to a computer next to a viewing device limited its market opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. The vision was to separate computing from the viewing device, allowing computation to occur elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. This concept led to the development of several foundational data center products:

*   **GeForce Now (GFN):** NVIDIA's first cloud product and data center offering, focused on cloud gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. It was a long journey, fighting problems like the speed of light and latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   **Remote Graphics:** The second data center product, which involved placing NVIDIA GPUs in enterprise data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.
*   **CUDA-accelerated Supercomputing:** The third product, combining [[Nvidias software leadership with CUDA | CUDA]] with NVIDIA GPUs to create supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.

This progressive development in data center computing allowed NVIDIA to be prepared for the [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI explosion]], as the data center segment became synonymous with [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI's progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

## The Mellanox Acquisition: A Strategic Imperative

The acquisition of Mellanox, a high-performance networking company, was deemed one of NVIDIA's best strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>. The rationale behind this seemingly "disconnected" move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a> was multi-faceted:

*   **Becoming a True Data Center Company:** Jensen Huang concluded that to be a data center-oriented company, NVIDIA needed to enter the networking domain. A data center is defined not by its processors, but by its networking infrastructure, security, and distribution of computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.
*   **Distributed Computing for AI:** Cloud computing, which started with hyperscale (many users on commodity components), differs significantly from [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI]], which relies on distributed computing. [[The role of AI and machine learning in NVIDIAs growth | AI]] involves orchestrating a single job across millions of processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.
*   **Infiniband's Role:** While commodity Ethernet is suitable for hyperscale applications like Hadoop or search queries, training large language models (LLMs) requires sharding models across many processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. The type of networking used in supercomputing, like Infiniband, is ideal for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. NVIDIA uniquely anticipated that Infiniband would be crucial for training large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **Team and Talent:** The Mellanox team, particularly the Israel team, was recognized as world-class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>.

Ultimately, the acquisition allowed NVIDIA to position itself "near opportunities" and "under the tree" when the "apple falls," enabling them to act quickly when trends like LLMs emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. This proactive approach ensures the company has the skills and infrastructure to monetize each step of its strategic journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.

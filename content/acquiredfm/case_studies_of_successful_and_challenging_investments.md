Benchmark, a prominent venture capital firm, has a history marked by both extraordinary successes and notable challenges in its investment portfolio. The firm's unique "equal partnership" model and its evolving philosophy have shaped its approach to identifying and nurturing companies.

## Benchmark's Investment Philosophy
Benchmark famously believes that [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | venture capital doesn't scale]] and has historically avoided growing its fund size, junior partners, platform teams, or multi-stage investments. This "anti-benchmark" approach emphasizes a deep, focused engagement with portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>. The firm operates with an [[balancing_confidence_and_openmindedness_in_investment_decisions | obsessive sense of fairness]] and a [[balancing_confidence_and_openmindedness_in_investment_decisions | religious devotion to equality]] among its partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>. This structure fosters a culture of "unbelievable trust" and teamwork, as partners have no incentive to claim individual credit given their equal economic stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. This means a Benchmark board member's relationship with an entrepreneur is often "like a co-founder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:05">[01:51:05]</a>.

A core tenet of Benchmark's [[complexity_investing_and_investment_philosophy | investment philosophy]] is that partners spend nearly all their time "on the field"—making investment decisions and helping portfolio companies—rather than on firm management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:12">[02:20:12]</a>. Their job, as one partner put it, is "not to see the future but to see the present very clearly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">[02:43:02]</a>. They look for opportunities that are "non-consensus and right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:43">[03:15:43]</a>, where they are willing to take risks others aren't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>.

## Case Studies of Successful Investments

Benchmark has been an early backer of many of the world's most important companies, demonstrating extraordinary returns on their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:40">[02:14:40]</a>.

### eBay
*   **The Opportunity:** In 1997, Pierre Omidyar's Auction Web (later eBay) was a side project generating so much traffic that it created server cost issues, forcing him to reluctantly charge a small listing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>. The service, though unpolished, was "product market fit" in action, with checks pouring into Omidyar's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.
*   **The Decision:** While most others on Sand Hill Road turned them down, Benchmark was interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>. The entire Benchmark team—including founders Bob Kagle (interested in consumer psychology) and Bruce Dunleavy (who knew Omidyar from a previous investment) and new partner David Byrne (who could recruit management)—collaborated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>. They offered a $6.7 million Series A at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This was a non-consensus bet, as most saw it as "people selling beanie babies" with a poor UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:52">[03:09:52]</a>.
*   **The Outcome:** eBay was growing 10% month-over-month and was profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. Benchmark also reportedly provided equity-backed loans to Omidyar and Jeff Skoll, giving them an incentive not to take a $50 million acquisition offer from Knight Ridder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>. In September 1998, just over a year after the investment, eBay went public, with Benchmark's stake worth $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>. By the time their lockup expired, it was worth over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a> on an $85 million fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>. This alone was a 47x return on their fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>. eBay's success was a testament to the market "waking up to the power of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>.

### Uber
*   **The Opportunity:** Bill Gurley had been actively searching for a company like Uber, having previously tried to convince Taxi Magic to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. The initial pitch came from Garrett Camp, focusing on limos, before Travis Kalanick took the CEO role and found product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:18">[02:56:18]</a>.
*   **The Decision:** In 2011, Benchmark invested $10 million in a Series A round at a $60 million post-money valuation, one of the first investments from Fund 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:39">[02:56:39]</a>. Bill Gurley joined the board.# Case Studies of Successful and Challenging Investments by Benchmark

Benchmark also reportedly provided equity-backed loans to Omidyar and Jeff Skoll, giving them an incentive not to take a $50 million acquisition offer from Knight Ridder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>. In September 1998, just over a year after the investment, eBay went public, with Benchmark's stake worth $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>.

### Uber
*   **The Opportunity:** Bill Gurley had been actively searching for a company like Uber, having previously tried to convince Taxi Magic to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. The initial pitch came from Garrett Camp, focusing on limos, before Travis Kalanick took the CEO role and found product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:18">[02:56:18]</a>.
*   **The Decision:** In 2011, Benchmark invested $10 million in a Series A round at a $60 million post-money valuation, one of the first investments from Fund 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:39">[02:56:39]</a>. Bill Gurley joined the board. The firm's "swashbuckling insanity" was evident when they called Travis Kalanick's Uber away from a meeting at Sequoia just up the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:25">[02:57:25]</a>.
*   **The Outcome:** Uber became the bulk of the returns for Fund 7. In 2018, Benchmark's holding in Uber was worth $8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:17">[02:54:17]</a>. This particular investment alone would have 16x'd the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:20">[02:54:20]</a>.

### Other Notable Successes
Benchmark's portfolio includes a long list of successful companies, often at early stages:
*   **Early E-commerce & Tech (1990s):** eShop, 1-800 Flowers, Ariba, Synopsis, and Juniper Networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:19">[02:19:19]</a>.
*   **Next Generation (2000s onwards):** OpenTable, Zillow, Twitter, Instagram, Snap, Riot Games, Asana, Discord, New Relic, and Modern Treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:56">[02:27:56]</a>.
*   **Peter Fenton's Investments:** Twitter, Docker, Zora, Hortonworks, New Relic, Elastic, and Quip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:51">[02:37:51]</a>.
*   **Mitch Laskey's Investments:** Jamdat (early mobile games company), Snap, Discord, and That Game Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:37">[02:40:37]</a>.
*   **Matt Cohler's Investments:** Instagram and Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:09">[02:46:09]</a>.
*   **Eric Vishria's Investments:** Confluent, Amplitude, Benchling, and Cerebras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:10">[03:12:10]</a>.
*   **Sarah Tavel's Investments:** Chainalysis (a non-consensus bet during a crypto winter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:56">[03:14:56]</a>.
*   **Chethan Puttagunta's Investments:** Elastic, Mulesoft, and MongoDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:55">[03:17:55]</a>.

## Case Studies of Challenging Investments & Missed Opportunities

Benchmark's journey has not been without its [[challenges_in_the_investment_management_industry | challenges]]. The firm has navigated internal shifts, external pressures, and missed opportunities, highlighting the inherent risks in [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | venture capital investments]].

### Webvan
*   **The Opportunity:** Webvan, founded by Louis Borders of Borders Books, aimed to build an online Walmart, starting with groceries and delivering everything by van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. It was incredibly ambitious, seeking to integrate last-mile delivery from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.
*   **The Decision:** David Byrne led Benchmark's investment, seeing it as the kind of "swagger bet" needed for the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. Benchmark invested $3.5 million (splitting a $7 million round with Sequoia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>.
*   **The Outcome:** Although Webvan famously became a cautionary tale of dot-com excess, it was considered a "great bet to make" from a strategic perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. At its peak, Webvan reached an $8 billion market cap after going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. While it eventually failed, the initial investment rationale was sound for a venture fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>.

### Accept.com
*   **The Opportunity:** An entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) at Benchmark, Danny Shader, identified a need for an independent online payment company, starting with accepting payments for eBay sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:59">[02:26:59]</a>.
*   **The Decision:** The Benchmark partnership was excited, and eBay initially considered investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:11">[02:27:11]</a>. However, after eBay's IPO, they got cold feet and decided against partnering, preferring to build their own solution or acquire a different company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:37">[02:27:37]</a>.
*   **The Outcome:** With its core business plan disrupted, Accept.com appeared "stillborn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>. Fortuitously, Amazon, looking to compete with eBay, swooped in and acquired Accept.com for $175 million in Amazon stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:20">[02:28:20]</a>. This provided a favorable exit for Benchmark and fostered a long-standing relationship with [[corporate_sponsorship_and_investment_insights | Jeff Bezos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:27">[02:28:27]</a>.

### Missed Opportunities: Google, Skype, and Facebook
The period between 2001 and 2010 was "not a great decade" for Benchmark, characterized by strategic missteps due to a temporary deviation from their core philosophy and an overextension into diverse ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:35">[02:37:35]</a>.

*   **Google:** As Benchmark was expanding its architecture and bringing in new partners, Google appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:40">[02:42:40]</a>. Bill Gurley and a subset of partners met with them but "failed to pursue" the opportunity with their typical hyper-competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:09">[02:23:09]</a>. This remains one of Gurley's biggest regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>.
*   **Skype:** Amidst their international expansion, Benchmark missed Skype, which emerged from Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:56">[02:54:56]</a>. Confusion over whether the Europe fund or the Menlo Park fund should handle the deal led to them losing the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:46">[02:24:46]</a>.
*   **Facebook:** In 2004-2005, Benchmark was in the conversation for Facebook's Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:36">[02:55:36]</a>. However, they were conflicted out due to an existing investment in Friendster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:13">[02:56:13]</a>. Tim Koogle, then CEO of Friendster, supposedly blocked Benchmark from even looking at Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:48">[02:56:48]</a>. These misses highlighted the risks of overextension and conflicts of interest.

### The Uber Lawsuit and its Aftermath
*   **The Challenge:** Uber's rapid growth brought unprecedented pressures, with its private market valuation reaching $70-80 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>. A series of controversies, including the "delete Uber" campaign and internal cultural issues, led to a loss of public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:11">[03:00:11]</a>. The board faced immense pressure to ensure the company could go public without destroying value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:52">[03:05:52]</a>.
*   **The Decision:** Benchmark, holding a board seat, sued founder Travis Kalanick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:23">[03:00:23]</a>. This was an "unprecedented" move in venture capital, seen by some as a "Rubicon Crossing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. The firm prioritized the "greater good" of the company's valuation and its thousands of impacted stakeholders over their relationship with the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:15">[03:06:15]</a>.
*   **The Outcome:** While the lawsuit generated significant controversy, it did not meaningfully impact Benchmark's standing or ability to attract future deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:04">[03:09:04]</a>. However, it indirectly "precipitated the end of the Fab Four era," as key partners like Matt Cohler and Mitch Laskey stepped back, and Bill Gurley followed later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:37">[03:09:37]</a>. The intense pressure and the nature of the situation made the work "stop being fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:54">[03:02:54]</a>.

## Evolution and Continued Performance
Despite these [[benchmarks_investment_strategies_and_notable_deals | challenges]], Benchmark has maintained its core principles of small, equal partnerships and focus on early-stage investments. They learned from their imperial era, shedding international funds (which became Balderton and TLV Partners) and large multi-stage ambitions to refocus on their strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. The firm's ability to undergo "refoundings," bringing in new generations of "All-Star" partners like Peter Fenton, Mitch Laskey, Matt Cohler, Eric Vishria, Sarah Tavel, Chethan Puttagunta, and Miles Grimshaw, has enabled its continued success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:45">[02:33:45]</a>. This adaptability and willingness to learn from their misses are central to Benchmark's enduring legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:32">[03:40:32]</a>.

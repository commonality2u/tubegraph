After graduating from college in 1986, [[Bezos and the foundation of Amazon | Jeff Bezos]] did not immediately enter the finance sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Instead, he joined a startup company called Phytel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Joining Phytel

Phytel was founded by computer science professors from Columbia University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The company specialized in developing very early network technology for high-speed trading applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, serving as a precursor to modern co-located data centers used by exchanges like NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

[[Bezos and the foundation of Amazon | Bezos]] worked at Phytel for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, building infrastructure for the then-nascent field of quantitative trading and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Impact and Learning

This early experience in networked computing proved highly beneficial for [[Bezos and the foundation of Amazon | Bezos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It provided him with a fundamental understanding of how these systems operated, including the meaning of data, packet counts, and the practical implications of hardware capabilities and bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This exposure allowed him to conceptualize the types of applications that could be built using the infrastructure available at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

This period in [[Bezos and the foundation of Amazon | Bezos]]'s life is considered crucial for understanding his later ventures, particularly [[Amazons early history and founding | Amazon]]. As one commentator noted, "you can't connect the dots looking forward but when you look back through jeff's past... it's like a straight line... [[Amazons early history and founding | Amazon]] isn't an extension of [[Bezos and the foundation of Amazon | Jeff Bezos's brain]] like it really is a company made in his image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Transition to Finance

In 1988, after two years at Phytel, [[Bezos and the foundation of Amazon | Bezos]] decided to move into banking, joining the investment bank Bankers Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. It is assumed that given his technical background and experience at Phytel, he was involved in quantitative trading and finance at the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Bankers Trust later became part of Deutsche Bank through a series of mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

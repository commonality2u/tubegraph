This article explores two contrasting investment approaches: investing in high-yield bonds, often considered speculative, and investing in blue-chip stocks, historically seen as the safest and fastest-growing companies.

## High Yield Bonds: Finding Value in Overlooked Areas

Initially, there was significant institutional "rigidity" against investing in high-yield bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Most [[Investment Strategies for High Yield Bonds | investment organizations]] had rules against buying bonds rated below A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The prevailing sentiment was "we don't do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

However, entering an investment area with "no other bidders" can be advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. [[History and Evolution of High Yield Bonds | Mike Milken]], influenced by a book called Hickman (which documented bond experiences from 1900-1943), found that the lower a bond's rating, the higher its actual realized total return was, not just its promised yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Despite defaults and bankruptcies, including during the Great Depression, the excess yield received as an inducement more than offset the credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

At the time, it was almost impossible to issue low-rated bonds, also known as non-investment grade or speculative grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Moody's manual, in 1978, even defined a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" and stated these bonds were "not proper for investment regardless of price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The approach to high-yield bonds can be compared to life insurance companies:
*   **Known Risk**: Defaults are an expected part of the investment landscape and don't come as a shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Analyzable Risk**: The risk can be analyzed, similar to how insurance companies assess an individual's health before issuing a policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Diversifiable Risk**: Diversification is key; just as an insurer wouldn't only cover skydivers, a bond investor diversifies their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Well-Paid Risk**: Investors are compensated for taking the risk through higher yields, creating a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

This [[Investment Strategies for High Yield Bonds | strategy]] led to steadily and safely making money by investing in what were perceived as "the worst public companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Blue Chip Stocks: The Pitfalls of Overvaluation

In stark contrast, the investment world in the late 1960s was dominated by the "Nifty Fifty" â€“ considered the best and fastest-growing companies in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The prevailing belief was that "nothing bad could ever happen" to these companies, and there was "no price too high" to pay for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This was the "polar opposite" of the approach to high-yield bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

However, both stances were ultimately wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. If one had bought the Nifty Fifty in 1969 and held them for five years, they would have "lost almost all [their] money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The primary reason was that these companies were "priced too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While the normal post-war P/E ratio for the S&P 500 was around 16, many Nifty Fifty stocks were selling at P/E ratios between 60 and 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Examples of Nifty Fifty companies and their struggles:
*   **IBM**: While once considered a guaranteed buy ("you can't be fired for buying IBM"), it faced significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Xerox**: Completely lost its market to imports and had to find a new business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Patterns**: A consumer company that didn't fare well, as the concept of home sewing declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The concept of "disruption" or the vulnerability of "moats" was not considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Companies like Xerox, by pricing copies high, created a "price umbrella" that competitors could get underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Ultimately, many of these companies experienced losses of over 90% from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

This comparison highlights that perceived "quality" or "growth potential" does not negate the importance of price in [[Evaluating investments using cash flows | investment valuation]]. An open-minded approach and a willingness to evolve one's thinking are crucial for profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

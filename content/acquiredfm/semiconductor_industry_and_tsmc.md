The [[The evolution of the semiconductor industry | semiconductor industry]] is considered one of the core building blocks of the information age, with [[The evolution of the semiconductor industry | semiconductors]] being described as the "new oxygen" in the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>. The industry is currently in an "epic shift" from the industrial age to the information age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.

## Investment Perspectives on the Semiconductor Industry

NZS Capital, a public equities hedge fund, dedicates significant time to researching [[The evolution of the semiconductor industry | semis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. They currently hold about a third of their portfolio in [[The evolution of the semiconductor industry | semis]], covering the entire value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

They categorize their [[The evolution of the semiconductor industry | semiconductor]] investments into two main types:
*   **Catalog Names (Resilient)**: These are companies less dependent on the leading edge of [[The impact of technological advancements on TSMCs growth | technological advancements]] and more on having a broad catalog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. Examples include Texas Instruments (TI) and Microchip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. Their parts can have a lifetime of 30 or 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>, boast high margins, and offer good growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. These businesses are difficult to replicate due to their breadth, not necessarily technical complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. TI's core business, for instance, focuses on industrial and auto markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:24">[01:34:24]</a>. TI surprisingly has higher operating margins than Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>.
*   **Digital/Leading Edge (Optionality)**: These companies operate at the cutting edge, producing 3-nanometer chips and high-compute functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. An example is Nvidia, which is held in the optionality tail of their portfolio due to valuation and context reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. Semiconductor capital equipment companies like ASML are considered resilient positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>.

### Moore's Law

Moore's Law is a concept that the [[The evolution of the semiconductor industry | semiconductor industry]] has historically operated under, doubling the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>. While there is debate, the "spirit of Moore's Law" is expected to continue for the next 10 to 15 years, as the industry typically only has that much visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. Key elements driving this continuation include:
*   **EUV Systems**: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) systems from ASML allow for shrinking transistors two-dimensionally, enabling more transistors per chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>. ASML believes EUV will drive performance for about 15 more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.
*   **"More than Moore"**: Innovation is not solely about transistors but also the chip package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>. This includes breaking up chips into "chiplets" (e.g., AMD's approach, part of Intel's future strategy) and stitching them together for more performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>.
*   **New Transistor Architectures**: The industry is moving to new transistor architectures like gate-all-around at 2nm or 3nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>.
*   **System-Level Performance**: Leading digital companies like Nvidia and AMD are focusing on making processors that can be stitched together into clusters with proprietary interconnects, shifting from just chip companies to computing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a>.

## [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]]

[[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]] is a top position for NZS Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a> and is considered a "classic scale company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:34">[01:22:34]</a>. It is a resilient position within their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>.

### [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | Business Model and Comparison with Samsung]]
[[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] operates as a pure-play foundry, meaning it does not compete with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>. This contrasts with Samsung, which also has a foundry business but competes with its customers in consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. This neutral party approach by [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] fosters significant trust with its customers, who often bet their entire company on [[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]]'s ability to make chips and provide capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>.

[[TSMCs business strategies and comparison with Apple | TSMC]] has lower gross margins (around 50%) than most of its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:39">[02:22:39]</a>, showcasing its commitment to creating more value than it takes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>. This approach, architected by [[Morris Chang and the founding of TSMC | Morris Chang]], focuses on long-term value creation and enabling their customers' businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:50">[02:24:50]</a>.

Samsung, while an amazing company, is strong in memory, holding 50% of the DRAM market and about a third of the NAND market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>. DRAM requires about 400 steps and over a month in the fab to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. However, logic (system-on-chips) remains the hardest to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

### [[Role of TSMC in the technology ecosystem | Role in the Ecosystem]]
[[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]] is deeply embedded in the [[Role of TSMC in the technology ecosystem | semiconductor ecosystem]], enabling the success of fabless chip companies like Nvidia, which achieve high gross margins (close to 70%) and low cyclicality due to outsourcing manufacturing to [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>.

[[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]] facilitates trillions of dollars in market capitalization for its partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:22">[01:48:22]</a>. It functions as a manufacturing platform, creating significantly more value for its customers and ecosystem than it captures for itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:36">[01:48:36]</a>.

The company's "Open Innovation Platform" is central to its [[Role of TSMC in the technology ecosystem | role in the ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>. It allows for collaboration across the industry, differing from Intel's historically closed system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>. This open approach, where [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]] forms alliances with others, has proven to be successful in driving [[The impact of technological advancements on TSMCs growth | technological advancements]] forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:27">[01:37:27]</a>. This is because no single entity can manage all aspects of [[The evolution of the semiconductor industry | semiconductor manufacturing]]; it "takes a village" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>.

### [[Geopolitical implications for TSMC | Geopolitical Implications]]
[[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]]'s importance is underscored by its [[Geopolitical implications for TSMC | geopolitical implications]]. The company is considered one of the top five most important technology platforms globally, arguably more critical than Apple in terms of its impact on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.

If [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]]'s fabs were shut down, the Western world would experience a technology setback of at least five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>. Currently, [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]]'s fabs produce a quarter of the digital chips made globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>. The impact on the global economy would be "extremely painful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. This leads to the logical conclusion that the U.S. and Western nations would likely protect [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]] at all costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>.

The idea of "semiconductor sovereignty" is gaining traction, exemplified by the building of a 5-nanometer [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]] fab in Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>. Similar fabs may be built in Europe as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>. However, relocating all production would take many years, as equipment would need to be rebuilt, and key personnel would need to be moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

The Taiwanese government started by owning 50% of [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>. While the exact current ownership percentage is unknown from the transcript, it is believed to still be significant (around 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:58">[01:45:58]</a>, making [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]] a "national champion" and virtually impossible to acquire by another company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:21">[01:46:21]</a>.

### [[Origins and history of TSMC | Origins and History of the Semiconductor]]
The invention of the transistor at Bell Labs is humorously attributed to a "UFO crash" in Roswell in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>. William Shockley, along with John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, made key insights into "doping germanium" to create solid-state switching, leading to the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. This ultimately laid the foundation for all modern electronic devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>.

A key moment in the [[Origins and history of TSMC | history of ASML]] (a critical partner for [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]]) occurred in 2012 when Intel, [[TSMCs impact on global semiconductor manufacturing | TSMC]], and Samsung collectively acquired 25% of ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>. This capital injection was crucial for ASML to develop EUV systems, enabling [[The impact of technological advancements on TSMCs growth | technological advancements]] needed for Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>. These companies have largely divested their stakes since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>.

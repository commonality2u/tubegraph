Facebook, now Meta, has developed products utilized by more humans than any other company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. With over 4 billion monthly active users and 3 billion daily active users, Meta's reach is unparalleled, exceeding even the largest historical empires like the Roman or British Empires in terms of global human population served <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Over its 20-year history, Meta has connected humanity through its applications including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. While early coverage focused on societal benefits, the last decade has seen more scrutiny on its controversies and stumbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## The Genesis: Mark Zuckerberg's Early Life and Projects

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born in May 1984 in Dobbs Ferry, New York, to a psychologist mother and a dentist father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. His father, Ed Zuckerberg, was interested in math and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Growing up, Mark's passions included turn-based strategy video games like Sid Meier's Civilization, computer programming, and classical studies (ancient Greek and Latin history) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

At age 10, Mark's interest in programming led him to buy "C++ for Dummies," and his parents hired a tutor for weekly programming lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. He found immense joy in spending hours writing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. During his childhood, he coded small projects, including a family chat tool called "Zucknet" for computers in his home and his dad's dental office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

The launch of AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) in 1997, when Mark was 13, significantly shaped his social experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. AIM, initially a rogue internal project at AOL, was free and became a viral consumer software, reaching 36 million users by 2001, including most middle and high schoolers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. It was also easily hackable and extensible, allowing for personalization and custom functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Mark was among the kids who wrote such hacks, gaining early experience with open, extensible platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

In high school, Mark transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, seeking a more challenging academic environment, particularly for his interest in Classics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. There, he met [[adam_d_angelo_and_quora | Adam D'Angelo]], who shared his passion for computers and AIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. For their senior project, they built "Synapse," an AI DJ plugin for Winamp that functioned as an early music recommender system, attracting acquisition offers from companies like Winamp and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. This experience instilled in Mark the confidence that he could build valuable things independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

## Harvard Years and the Birth of Facebook

Upon entering Harvard in Fall 2002, Mark focused on projects rather than just classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. He developed around ten side projects, driven by the feeling of having "superpowers as a programmer" in an era not yet saturated with apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

One early project was "Course Match," a tool allowing students to see which friends were taking which classes, which quickly became popular due to its utility in social planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. Mark observed that people spent a lot of time "combing over that list of people," even on a simple text-based tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

This led to "Face Mash" (October 2003), a "hot or not" website for Harvard students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>. Mark illicitly downloaded "Facebook" photos (printed directories of students) from Kirkland House servers to populate the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. Face Mash generated immense engagement, melting down Kirkland House servers and forcing Harvard IT to shut down internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. While Mark faced disciplinary probation, the incident made him a "Harvard computer celebrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Face Mash also marked his first experience building a rich web application using the open-source LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), highlighting a new era where one needed "neither money nor permission to launch an application" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

During this time, the Winklevoss twins approached Mark to program "Harvard Connection," an idea to digitize Harvard's Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. This was not a unique idea, as many universities had similar initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

In January 2004, inspired by his observations about human connection and the power of simple tools, Mark coded "thefacebook.com" in a week, launching it on February 4, 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. The site's initial functionality allowed users to search for people, see who was in their classes (like Course Match), and find friends of friends (like [[adam_d_angelo_and_quora | Adam D'Angelo]]'s Buddy Zoo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. Crucially, registration was limited to .edu email addresses, ensuring real identities and fostering trust within the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>. Unlike competitors like MySpace or Friendster, Facebook required user-submitted content, training users to build their own profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>. This focus on authentic identity and a trusted, private network became a foundational principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

Within 24 hours, 650 people joined, and within two weeks, over half of Harvard's undergraduates were active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. This initial "super dense, super engaged, and super active" network set norms for engagement and allowed for viral radiation as the network grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. The "trance" of endlessly clicking through profiles led to incredibly high engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>.

Mark quickly added features like "the Wall" for public posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. He recruited roommates Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, along with Andrew McCollum, and Eduardo Saverin (who invested $1,000, matching Mark's $1,000) to formalize the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>. Facebook strategically expanded to other colleges, even choosing Columbia where an existing competitor resided, demonstrating an early "globally dominant" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. Each school initially operated as a separate network, a technological decision that aided scaling by containing computational load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

## Silicon Valley, Sean Parker, and Initial Funding

In summer 2004, the Facebook crew moved to Palo Alto, California, renting a house with a pool and a zipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. This move marked a shift from a "project" to contemplating starting a "company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. Eduardo Saverin, who stayed in New York, saw his stake in the company diluted, a key plot point of "The Social Network" movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.

In Palo Alto, [[sean_parker_and_the_founding_of_facebook | Sean Parker]], co-founder of Napster and e-contact list company Plaxo, encountered the Facebook team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. Having witnessed the struggles of founders with venture capitalists (he was kicked out of Plaxo by its board), Parker advised Mark on establishing permanent board control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. Parker became Facebook's first president, ensuring Mark maintained control over the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>.

Parker also helped secure Facebook's first external investment. Despite the team's concurrent focus on "Wirehog," a file-sharing product (which Parker suggested be called "Dropbox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>), investors like Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn founder) and Mark Pincus (later Zynga founder) were impressed by Facebook's core product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. Hoffman introduced Mark to Peter Thiel, who was starting Founders Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>. Thiel's "founder-friendly" approach, radical at the time, aligned with Mark's desire for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47">[01:25:47]</a>. Founders Fund invested $500,000 as part of a $5 million pre-money valuation round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>.

After the summer, most of the original team decided to stay in Palo Alto rather than return to Harvard, though some, like Andrew McCollum, later completed their degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:24">[01:28:24]</a>. Dustin Moskovitz remained with the company until 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. [[adam_d_angelo_and_quora | Adam D'Angelo]] continued to collaborate remotely until officially becoming CTO in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:55">[01:29:55]</a>. Shawn Parker departed Facebook in Spring 2005 due to legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:28">[01:30:28]</a>.

## Explosive Growth and Product Innovations

By Spring 2005, Facebook had dropped "the" from its name after purchasing the facebook.com domain for $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:42">[01:31:42]</a>. In Spring 2005, Accel led a $12.7 million Series A round at a $98 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:20">[01:33:20]</a>. This was a groundbreaking deal, as it allowed Mark to maintain board control and gave Accel less than 20% of the company, unheard of for a post-dot-com bubble VC deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>. Accel faced skepticism from limited partners, including Princeton and Harvard, who dropped out of their fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

Mark's ambitious 2005 product roadmap included a site redesign, a photo application, a personalized newspaper (Newsfeed), an events feature, a local business product, and a "I'm bored" feature (Platform) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>. These features were designed to reinforce each other and drive engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>. The photos feature, with its innovative tagging capabilities, was particularly significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:46">[01:42:46]</a>. By November 2005, Facebook was generating 230 million page views daily, surpassing Google, due to the "trance" users experienced while browsing profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:49">[01:45:49]</a>.

Facebook's user base grew from 3 million in June 2005 to 5 million by September 2005, including almost a third of all US college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:09">[01:47:09]</a>. Its engagement metrics were exceptionally high, with 70% daily active users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:37">[01:47:37]</a>. By October 2005, Facebook was the 10th most visited site on the internet, generating $1 million a month in revenue from ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:16">[01:49:16]</a>.

In summer 2006, as college growth paused, Facebook faced concerns about its expansion beyond colleges, as tests with high schools and workplaces had mixed results due to lack of standardized email addresses and users' unwillingness to share personal content in professional settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:30">[01:49:30]</a>.

## Acquisition Offers and Strategic Partnerships

In summer 2006, Viacom offered $750 million to acquire Facebook, followed by a $1 billion offer from Yahoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:59">[01:53:59]</a>. Despite slowing growth and internal pressure to sell, Mark initially agreed to the Yahoo deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>. However, when Yahoo's stock dropped, reducing the offer to $800 million, Mark rejected it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:54">[01:55:54]</a>. This decision, driven by Mark's long-term vision and desire to run a great company, proved prescient, as Facebook's value continued to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>.

In August 2006, Facebook entered its first partnership with Microsoft, where Microsoft took over selling Facebook's display ad inventory domestically, guaranteeing a CPM and helping Microsoft bootstrap its online services division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:46">[02:00:46]</a>. This deal significantly boosted Facebook's revenue, from $9 million in 2005 to $48 million in 2006 and $153 million in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:26">[02:02:26]</a>.

### [[facebooks_introduction_of_newsfeed_and_platform | Newsfeed and Platform Launch]]

Upon [[adam_d_angelo_and_quora | Adam D'Angelo]] joining full-time as CTO in 2006, Facebook began building a more robust technology infrastructure, transitioning from weekly code pushes to multiple daily deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:37">[02:04:37]</a>. They recruited top engineering talent, prioritizing raw intelligence over experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:50">[02:05:50]</a>.

In September 2006, Facebook launched Newsfeed, a "personalized newspaper" of friends' activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:17">[02:14:17]</a>. Newsfeed was a massive paradigm shift, moving the social network from static profiles to a dynamic, media-rich feed, essentially inventing the "feed" concept that is now ubiquitous across products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:40">[02:08:40]</a>. Building it required advanced engineering to process and rank data from connected users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:02">[02:09:02]</a>.

The launch, directly to all users without opt-in, caused significant backlash, with 30,000 angry emails and 10% of the user base joining a "students against Facebook Newsfeed" group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>. Users felt their expectations of privacy were violated, even though the technical privacy settings hadn't changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:50">[02:19:50]</a>. Despite the uproar and a temporary dip in revenue, Mark and the team, trusting their engagement data, refined Newsfeed by adding controls and educating users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:46">[02:17:46]</a>. Within two weeks, users adapted, and engagement skyrocketed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:05">[02:19:05]</a>.

Following Newsfeed, open registration was launched at the end of September 2006, allowing anyone to sign up for Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:39">[02:21:39]</a>. This significantly accelerated user growth, from 5,000-10,000 new users daily to 70,000 daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:17">[02:24:17]</a>.

In May 2007, Facebook launched its developer platform, F8, opening the Facebook API (Graph API) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:14">[02:26:14]</a>. This realized Mark's "I'm bored" vision, allowing developers to build apps and games directly on Facebook, leveraging its user attention and rich user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:40">[02:28:40]</a>. This led to massive developer adoption, with 5,000 developers joining in two days, far exceeding the initial goal of 5,000 in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:03">[02:30:03]</a>. The platform introduced a new layer of engagement, allowing users to play games and take quizzes with friends, an early foreshadowing of mobile app usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>.

In October 2007, Facebook expanded its Microsoft partnership, making Microsoft the worldwide exclusive third-party ad network for all display ads, and including a $240 million investment from Microsoft at a $15 billion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This deal underscored Facebook's exponential growth, having rejected a $1 billion Yahoo offer just over a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:31">[02:45:31]</a>.

### [[facebooks_early_challenges_and_strategy | Early Challenges and Strategy]]

Despite its successes, Facebook stumbled with "Beacon," an advertising product launched in November 2007, led by Chamath Palihapitiya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:59">[02:58:59]</a>. Beacon published users' e-commerce activity into their Newsfeeds without explicit consent, leading to massive user backlash and privacy concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The company, initially applying its "users will get used to it" Newsfeed playbook, eventually made Beacon opt-in before killing it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:31">[02:55:31]</a>. This failure prompted Mark to bring in an experienced advertising leader, [[insights_from_mark_zuckerbergs_candid_conversation | Sheryl Sandberg]], from Google in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>.

In 2008, user growth stalled again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:29">[02:59:29]</a>. This led to the formation of Facebook's "growth team," the first of its kind in the industry, led by Chamath Palihapitiya, Alex Schultz, Naomi Gleit, and Javier Olivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:54">[02:59:54]</a>. The team's mission was to use the product itself as the primary lever for growth, emphasizing data obsession and iterating rapidly on features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:35">[03:01:35]</a>. Key initiatives included crowdsourced internationalization, which not only facilitated global expansion but also fostered user ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:50">[03:02:50]</a>, and "People You May Know," an algorithmic carousel designed to help new users quickly connect with friends, thereby boosting engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:15">[03:06:15]</a>.

The growth team's efforts paid off dramatically. From barely 100 million users in August 2008, Facebook reached almost 150 million by year-end, and then 350 million users globally by the end of 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:01">[03:10:01]</a>. Engagement, measured by the ratio of daily to monthly active users, also steadily improved over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:19">[03:11:19]</a>.

In 2009, Facebook adopted the "Like" button, originally invented by FriendFeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:55">[03:11:55]</a>. This lightweight engagement mechanism boosted overall engagement and provided valuable data for the Newsfeed algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:51">[03:14:51]</a>. The Like button also served as a "Trojan Horse," encouraging third-party websites to embed Facebook's JavaScript, which in turn provided valuable data for Facebook's nascent advertising targeting engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:06">[03:16:06]</a>.

Under Sheryl Sandberg's leadership, Facebook's revenue soared: $280 million in 2008, nearly $800 million in 2009, and $2 billion in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:38">[03:17:38]</a>. By 2011, revenue reached $3.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:12">[03:18:12]</a>.

## [[impact_of_mobile_on_facebook | The Mobile Transition and IPO]]

Despite its web dominance, the rise of mobile posed an existential threat to Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:22">[03:18:22]</a>.
1.  **Closed Ecosystems**: iOS and Android were proprietary, controlled by Apple and Google, unlike the open web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:40">[03:19:40]</a>.
2.  **Platform Failure**: Facebook's web platform, a core value proposition, did not translate to mobile, as apps cannot run inside other apps on closed mobile operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:06">[03:21:06]</a>. This meant the loss of Facebook Credits and the ability to dictate monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:37">[03:21:37]</a>.
3.  **Advertising Challenges**: The lucrative right-hand column ads from desktop had no equivalent on mobile. There was also a strong internal "cultural allergy" to placing ads directly in the Newsfeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:26">[03:22:26]</a>. Facebook's S1 filing in 2012 candidly stated, "We do not currently directly generate any meaningful revenue from the use of Facebook mobile products and our ability to do so successfully is unproven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:52">[03:23:52]</a>.
4.  **Slow Iteration**: Mobile app development required app store review processes, introducing weeks of delay and potential rejections from Apple and Google, hindering Facebook's "move fast and break things" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:39">[03:24:39]</a>.
5.  **Competitive Reset**: On mobile, Facebook became just one icon among many on the home screen, allowing new, specialized apps like Instagram and WhatsApp to compete for user attention in specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:56">[03:25:56]</a>.

## [[significance_of_facebooks_initial_public_offering_ipo | IPO and Post-IPO Struggle]]

Facebook was effectively forced to go public. By the end of 2011, it had crossed 500 shareholders, mandating quarterly public reporting by the SEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:19">[03:30:19]</a>. Despite the mobile headwinds, Facebook had recently overcome a major competitive threat from Google+, mobilizing its monolithic codebase and engineering culture to quickly respond with competing features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:40">[03:31:40]</a>. They also had just settled a consent decree with the FTC regarding past privacy missteps, creating a window of perceived stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:23">[03:35:23]</a>.

On February 1, 2012, Facebook filed its S1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:51">[03:37:51]</a>. During the quiet period, on April 9, 2012, Mark Zuckerberg made the audacious decision to acquire Instagram for $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:20">[03:38:20]</a>. This move, executed over a weekend, added another layer of uncertainty to the IPO, as Instagram itself had no revenue and only 27 million users at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:59">[03:38:59]</a>.

On May 15, 2012, just two days before pricing, General Motors publicly announced it was pulling all its advertising from Facebook, citing ineffectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:45">[03:40:45]</a>. Nonetheless, on May 17, Facebook priced its IPO at $38 a share, the very top of its range, raising $16 billion at a $104 billion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:16">[03:41:16]</a>.

Trading on May 18 was chaotic due to NASDAQ system overloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:56">[03:41:56]</a>. The stock briefly rose to $45 but then crashed, ending the day at $38.23, only propped up by underwriting banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:18">[03:42:18]</a>. The stock continued to fall, bottoming out at $17.68 on September 4, 2012, a 53.5% drop from its IPO price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:07">[03:43:07]</a>. The company's market cap was cut by more than half, and IPO investors were underwater for 16 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:39">[03:43:39]</a>.

## Mobile Monetization and the Future

Facing this crisis, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg decided to shift all engineering resources from desktop ads to mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:51">[03:45:51]</a>. This was a "bet all moment," as mobile ads, being full-screen in the Newsfeed, had to be high-quality to avoid alienating users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:15">[03:47:15]</a>. This necessity became the mother of invention, leading to the creation of a highly valuable and engaging mobile ad unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:51">[03:47:51]</a>.

Andrew "Boz" Bosworth, Mark's former TA, was tasked with leading the mobile ads effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:20">[03:48:20]</a>. He initially implemented a "People You May Like" carousel for brands as a stop-gap measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:48">[03:49:48]</a>. The ultimate goal, "Project Whaleshark," was to integrate native ads directly into the Newsfeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:02">[03:51:02]</a>.

In a crucial contrarian move, Bosworth convinced Mark that Facebook needed *more* ads, not fewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:09">[03:55:09]</a>. His insight was that with a liquid marketplace of advertisers and fantastic algorithms, more ads would lead to better targeting and more relevant content for users, essentially becoming "ads as content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:51">[03:55:51]</a>.

By the fourth quarter of 2013, this strategy had transformed Facebook's financials: mobile advertising accounted for 53% of revenue, and total ad revenue grew 76% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:01">[03:59:01]</a>. Desktop revenue, meanwhile, began to shrink, validating the pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:28">[03:58:28]</a>. This 18-month journey saved the company, establishing a unique and defensible native mobile ad unit that defined a generation of monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:01">[03:59:01]</a>.

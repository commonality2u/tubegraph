The semiconductor industry has undergone significant transformations, moving from vertically integrated manufacturers to a highly specialized ecosystem. This evolution has been driven by strategic decisions, technological advancements, and economic principles like the learning curve.

## Early Industry Structure and the Rise of Fabless
In the early days, the semiconductor industry was dominated by integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel and Texas Instruments (TI), who designed and manufactured their own chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:07">[02:16:07]</a>. The idea of a "fabless" company—one that designs chips but outsources manufacturing—was not initially prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>.

However, Dr. Morris Chang, founder of [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]], foresaw the emergence of the fabless model in the mid-1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>. He observed companies like Gordon Campbell's startup and ATM (founded by Don Valentine) that sought manufacturing without owning fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:52">[02:18:52]</a>. This vision led to the creation of [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] in 1987 as a pure-play foundry, a business model where the company focuses solely on manufacturing chips for other designers without competing with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:35">[01:56:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. This non-competitive stance became a foundational advantage for [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>.

## Key Principles and Strategic Decisions
### The Learning Curve
A critical concept in the semiconductor industry's evolution is the learning curve (also known as the experience curve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:59">[02:02:59]</a>. This theory, refined by Dr. Chang during his time at TI with consultants like Bill Bane from Boston Consulting Group, states that as a company produces more of a product, its unit cost decreases due to increased efficiency and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:02">[02:07:02]</a>.

For semiconductor manufacturing, this implies that the company with the highest volume will achieve the lowest costs, creating a self-reinforcing cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>. To achieve this, companies might initially set prices unprofitably low to capture market share and drive volume, then reinvest the gains from scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:40">[02:38:40]</a>.

### [[Evolution of Moores Law and advanced chip design | Moore's Law]]
[[Evolution of Moores Law and advanced chip design | Moore's Law]], while technically evolving beyond its original definition, spiritually dictates that the world demands roughly twice the computing power every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:31">[02:44:31]</a>. This constant demand fuels investment in smaller nanometer nodes and advanced manufacturing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:53">[02:44:53]</a>.

## Key Players and Their Roles

Its early customers included companies like [[Collaborative innovation in the semiconductor industry | Nvidia]] and [[Challenges and strategic decisions in the semiconductor industry | Qualcomm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>. [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s commitment to high R&D (8% of revenue regardless of recession) and significant capital expenditure, particularly on nodes like 28 nanometer, allowed it to gain leadership in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   **Intel**: Historically a dominant IDM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>. However, its integrated model and approach to customer relationships differed from [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s foundry model, leading to lost opportunities, such as not manufacturing for Apple's iPhone chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. Intel's practice of repurposing older fabs for leading-edge processes also meant they lost the capacity for older node generations, which [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:50">[02:33:50]</a>.
*   **[[Collaborative innovation in the semiconductor industry | Nvidia]]**: A key fabless customer of [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]], their relationship began in 1997 when [[Collaborative innovation in the semiconductor industry | Nvidia]] was a small, struggling company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s manufacturing of [[Collaborative innovation in the semiconductor industry | Nvidia]]'s successful chips was crucial for [[Collaborative innovation in the semiconductor industry | Nvidia]]'s survival and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **[[Challenges and strategic decisions in the semiconductor industry | Qualcomm]]**: Another early and significant fabless customer that shifted from IBM to [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] in the late 1990s, signaling IBM's decline in the foundry business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:03">[01:55:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:41">[01:58:41]</a>.
*   **Apple**: Became a major customer for [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s 20-nanometer process, despite initial reluctance from [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] due to it being a "half-step" detour from their planned 16-nanometer progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. This partnership cemented [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s position at the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>.
*   **[[Evolution of Moores Law and advanced chip design | ARM]]**: Its rise as a viable CPU architecture, especially for mobile devices, was crucial in enabling the fabless model and creating opportunities for dedicated foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:51">[02:24:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:02">[02:26:02]</a>.
*   **[[Influence of upstream suppliers like ASML on semiconductor technology | ASML]]**: While not explicitly detailed, the development of specialized equipment for advanced nodes is a critical part of the industry's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a>.
*   **EDA Companies (Synopsys, Cadence)**: These companies provide the chip design software crucial for fabless companies and IDMs, playing a vital role in the design-manufacturing interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:32">[02:28:32]</a>.

## Challenges and Adaptations
The industry has faced several challenges:
*   **Recessions**: The dot-com bubble burst (2000-2003) significantly impacted semiconductor revenues, with recovery taking several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>. The 2008 financial crisis also led to a drop in business, prompting difficult decisions like layoffs, which Dr. Chang later reversed at [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] to maintain employee trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:26">[02:08:26]</a>.
*   **Technological Shifts**: Adapting to new nanometer nodes, such as the 40nm yield issues and the "detour" to 20nm for Apple, required significant investment and strategic agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.
*   **Global Competition**: [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]] faced intense competition, notably from Samsung, which briefly took a lead in 16nm development by skipping the 20nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>.

## The Role of [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Hsinchu Science Park]] and Ecosystems
The concentration of semiconductor-related companies in areas like [[The creation and evolution of Silicon Valleys tech industry | Hsinchu Science Park]] in Taiwan has been instrumental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This "ecosystem" includes not only foundries but also chip design companies, software providers, and even universities, fostering close collaboration and rapid innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:03">[02:28:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:33">[02:29:33]</a>. This integrated environment makes it difficult to replicate the manufacturing capabilities elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>.

## Scale and Future Outlook
The semiconductor market has experienced explosive growth, from $26 billion in 1987 to $527 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. The industry is characterized by massive capital expenditures (e.g., $20 billion for a new fab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>, which, combined with the learning curve, favors dominant players. This suggests a future with natural monopoly characteristics, where only a few companies can afford the necessary investments to stay at the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:16">[02:42:16]</a>. [[Semiconductor Industry and TSMC | TSMC]]'s current technology leadership and proprietary packaging solutions (like CoWoS for AI chips) further strengthen its competitive advantage, making it increasingly difficult for customers to find alternative suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:21">[02:43:21]</a>.

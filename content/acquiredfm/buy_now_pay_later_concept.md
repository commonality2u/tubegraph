From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Buy now pay later (BNPL) is a payment method that allows consumers to purchase goods or services immediately and pay for them at a later date, often in installments, without necessarily incurring interest or traditional credit card fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Klarna, founded 19 years ago in Stockholm, Sweden, is widely recognized as a pioneering company in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Origins and Core Insight

The concept of BNPL emerged from observations within the account receivables, factoring, and collection industries in Sweden in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. At that time, while card payments (Visa, MasterCard) were prevalent online, mail-order catalog businesses traditionally offered a "bill me" or invoice option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

For [[Shift in retail with technology and ecommerce | distance selling]], the ability for a consumer to receive and inspect a product before payment made significant sense, providing safety and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This was particularly relevant in Sweden, where many consumers primarily used debit cards and were wary of credit cards due to concerns about debt and online security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The fundamental insight was that individuals would want to pay later for individual purchases, primarily to ensure trust and safety in an emerging e-commerce landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Early Business Model and Profitability

Klarna's initial business model mirrored a factoring idea. It underwrote and acquired account receivables from merchants, taking on the risk of non-payment and handling the administrative burden of collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Crucially, merchants were often more concerned with risk and administration than immediate cash flow. Klarna would pay merchants approximately three weeks after a purchase, allowing the company to operate with a positive cash flow initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This unique approach enabled Klarna to become profitable within six months of launch, funded effectively by its merchants for the first few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Merchants benefited from increased sales by enabling transactions for a broader customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

The term "buy now pay later" was likely coined by the Financial Times, and Klarna preceded companies like Afterpay, which gained significant traction later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

## Market Expansion and Evolution

Initially, Klarna expanded into neighboring Nordic countries, then into Germany and the Netherlands, where a strong tradition of invoice-based payments (like "Rechnung") already existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. The company initially believed there was "no need" for its product in the US and UK due to the prevalence of credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

However, a shift occurred:
*   **Rise of Debit Cards:** Between 2007-2018, debit card usage grew ten times faster than credit card usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **"Self-Aware Avoiders":** A McKinsey report from 2014 identified a segment of the US population, about 20%, who actively avoided credit cards due to negative experiences or distrust of their practices (e.g., promoting over-indebtedness, revolving balances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. This group, often with high household incomes, desired simple, transparent fees and structured payment plans, essentially describing the core features of BNPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This demographic became the "Swedish market" for Klarna in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

After initially focusing on a broader "checkout" platform akin to Stripe or Adyen, Klarna pivoted around 2015 to prioritize the consumer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. This involved developing a consumer app that allowed users to shop with Klarna even where it wasn't directly integrated, by generating one-time virtual Visa cards within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>. This strategy allowed Klarna to gain significant consumer momentum in the US, providing a "win" perception against competitors like Afterpay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:24">[00:54:24]</a>.

## BNPL vs. Traditional Credit Cards

BNPL systems generally offer a more structured and transparent payment plan compared to traditional revolving credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. While Klarna initially experimented with some revolving credit models that mimicked traditional banking "tricks" to maximize interest, the company later reflected on these practices and moved away from tactics that might lead to consumer debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

This shift highlights a key distinction:
*   **Consumer Benefit:** BNPL models are designed to be better for consumers, leading to less debt and lower fees compared to credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.
*   **Innovator's Dilemma:** Traditional banks face an "innovator's dilemma" because offering BNPL, which typically generates less revenue per user than revolving credit, would directly threaten their existing, highly profitable credit card portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

Klarna aims to reintroduce consumer choice, similar to the old "press one for debit, press two for credit" option at point-of-sale terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. This means offering both "pay now" (debit-like) and "pay later" options. As of transcript, 35% of Klarna's volume is "pay now," with an ambition to reach 50/50 online and 80% debit in-store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

## Future Outlook: Digital Financial Assistants and AI

Klarna envisions a future where financial services are highly automated by "digital financial assistants" that manage and optimize a consumer's finances, such as mortgages and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. This future relies on:
*   **Global Scale:** Being a global player with high transaction volume is crucial for effectively serving consumers and leveraging data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
*   **Data, especially SKU-level data:** Klarna's origin as an invoice business required it to capture SKU-level details (specific product, color, size) for every purchase, a competitive advantage over traditional card networks like Visa, which typically only receive transaction amount and merchant name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. This rich data allows for more personalized and valuable financial services with consumer consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.
*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI is a critical enabler for achieving cost efficiency and enhancing customer experience. Klarna has demonstrated AI's impact in customer service, where an AI assistant achieved customer satisfaction on par with human agents and handled two-thirds of customer service tasks directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>.

This vision implies a significant [[Payment and financial industry trends | disruption in the banking industry]], as digital assistants could eliminate current "excess profits" derived from customer stickiness and lack of easy switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. The shift aims to move financial services towards increased automation and efficiency, ultimately benefiting consumers. Klarna believes that in a few years, three or four large global players will emerge as the primary digital financial assistants for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>. This will lead to a "massive revival of fintech" and companies with much higher revenue per employee than historically seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

Brooks Running, a Seattle-based company with a century-long history, underwent a significant transformation under the leadership of CEO Jim Weber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This turnaround story saw the company move from near bankruptcy to a billion-dollar brand, characterized by a sharp strategic focus and a unique business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## The State of Brooks Pre-Weber

When Jim Weber took the helm in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, Brooks was in dire straits. The company was losing five million dollars a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, was $30 million in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, and was a week away from missing payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. With modest revenue of $60 million, it was clear the business was not generating sufficient profit to cover its "extremely real costs in making shoes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. For 90 years, Brooks had sold a diverse range of products at every price point to a "pretty random set of consumers in every category," not just running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

At that time, the athletic footwear and apparel industry's mindset originated from the need to keep shoe factories busy all year long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This led companies to produce items for various sports, from baseball cleats to bowling shoes, even if they were losing money on most of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Brooks sold 30-dollar and 80-dollar shoes, along with performance running shoes, court shoes, and "family footwear" which were low-margin and tied up inventory and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Retailers were ambivalent, as Brooks was "number eight or nine at everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Weber's Vision: Focus on the Runner

Jim Weber "bet the company exclusively on serving [[focus_on_active_runners_and_performance_innovation | active runners]]" and cut all other business lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This decision was seen as "crazy" by most people, who thought the company wouldn't survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The strategic move meant losing major customers like Big 5, which accounted for one-sixth of their revenue, because those retailers were selling low-margin shoes that Brooks was losing money on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Instead of focusing on products for every sport, the insight was that the real business was in "trainers" (everyday running shoes), not racing shoes or spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

> "The secret to success is constancy of purpose." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>
> â€” Jim Weber, quoting Benjamin Disraeli

Brooks' brand positioning became "approachable" and "inclusive," celebrating "every one of those people" who are investing in themselves through running, regardless of their finish line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This is distinct from brands focused on "victory," like the "little brand down in Portland Oregon" ([[Nikes business strategy and history | Nike]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. The company positioned itself as being "about you and your run," not the podium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Brooks invests heavily in R&D, focusing on biomechanics and habitual joint motion to engineer materials specifically for running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. They also recognized the importance of addressing women in sporting goods, who have driven the sport since the mid-90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## Early Turnaround and Financial Stability

To gain trust and achieve profitability, Brooks made a revised profit plan that was achievable, which resulted in employees receiving a bonus after four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. They focused on cash flow, generating $10 million in the first nine months by shrinking the balance sheet and optimizing the product mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. A critical move was refining the Adrenaline shoe in 2001 for 2002, which became an "incredibly balanced shoe" and helped save the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Since 2001, Brooks has not needed any additional capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, boasting a return on tangible net assets over 50% for the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. This financial model of high margins and strong operating profits is a key reason [[Warren Buffett]] (part of [[Bill McDermotts journey from salesperson to CEO | Berkshire Hathaway]]) "likes it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

## Navigating Ownership Changes

Brooks' journey involved several ownership changes:
*   **JH Whitney Capital**: Brooks was owned by this private equity firm, which had new partners and management, leading to instability before Weber's arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Whitney recapitalized the company with a $7 million check in its "darkest hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Russell Athletic**: In 2006, Brooks was acquired by Russell Athletic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. Weber negotiated for Brooks to maintain its independence, pitching them as the "crazy uncle out in Seattle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.
*   **Berkshire Hathaway**: Two years later, Russell Athletic was acquired by Fruit of the Loom, which was already owned by Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. Brooks negotiated to retain its independence from Fruit of the Loom, resisting a move to Bowling Green that would have "killed Brooks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. In 2012, [[Warren Buffett]] personally elevated Brooks, making it a direct report to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>. Weber described Buffett's understanding of "brands and... the moat around the brand" as highly influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

## The Business Model and Moat

Brooks' business model focuses on running shoes as a "consumable item" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. Frequent runners, covering 20 to 30 miles a week, go through 2.6 pairs of shoes a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This creates "stickiness" and customer loyalty, as the shoe is a critical piece of equipment for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Brooks' average selling price per pair is $130 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

Brooks' "moat" is multifaceted:
*   **[[focus_on_active_runners_and_performance_innovation | Product Excellence]]**: Consistently building "great product" that fits, feels, and rides well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. They invest more in R&D focused on running metrics and engineer materials specifically for the motion of running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Business Model Execution at Scale**: Strong retail partnerships with specialty running shops and outdoor sporting goods retailers where Brooks is often the number one brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.
*   **Digital Marketing**: Reaching runners who are "digitally savvy" and in "active evaluation mode" for shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.

At marathons like Boston and Houston, Brooks is consistently one of the top one or two shoes on course, measured by high-speed cameras and AI linking shoes to bibs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. This "shoe count" is a true test, as it represents the frequent runner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

## Growth and Pandemic Resilience

Weber grew the business from $60 million to over a billion dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Brooks tripled its business from 2009 to 2014, navigating the Great Recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

The company's focus on running proved to be [[running_shoe_market_dynamics_and_strategies | recession-resistant]] and "COVID-friendly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>. When retail shut down in early 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>:
*   **Data-Driven Insights**: Brooks observed increased activity on Strava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.
*   **Field Marketing**: Field marketing personnel counted runners in high-traffic parks, confirming daily growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.
*   **Digital Sales**: Digital sales, including on Brooks' own website and partners', soared from 30% to 80% of total product sales by April 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain Agility**: Brooks turned its supply chain back on "six to 12 weeks before anybody else did" due to its exclusive focus on performance running gear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

As a result, Brooks grew 27% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a> and 31% in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>, reaching $1.13 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. This makes them part of a "rarefied club" of global billion-dollar brands, unique because all their products are "premium full price full margin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. In 2022, Brooks became the number one running shoe brand in the United States, holding 21.5% market share in performance running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

## Future Vision and Risks

Brooks aims for a 10-year vision of becoming a global brand with 60 million customers, up from 15 million, and achieving $4 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. This growth is expected to be 20-30% annually, especially internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

The riskiest part of Brooks' business now lies in operational execution and supply chain resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. Experiences like a malfunctioning distribution center in 2019 that disappointed customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>, and factories in Vietnam shutting down during Q3 2021 due to COVID-19, highlight the importance of diversifying risk and ensuring agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

## Jim Weber's Personal Journey

Jim Weber battled esophageal cancer, which was diagnosed after experiencing poor running performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>. Despite a 20% five-year survival rate, he is now cancer-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. His experience taught him not to live in fear or bitterness, but to "soak in everything I can on any given day" and enjoy life's moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>. He continues to lead Brooks, emphasizing the joy he finds in his work and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>.

The Seven Powers Framework, introduced by Hamilton Helmer, aims to provide a systematic understanding of strategy, serving as a form of pattern recognition for founders and those interested in creating successful companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:15">[08:42:15]</a>. It focuses on the second major step change in a company's value: acquiring power, which is distinct from achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:14">[09:11:14]</a>. Power, in this context, refers to a company's ability to retain a significant percentage of the value it creates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. The framework aims to empower inventors and founders by giving them greater acuity in developing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

## Applying the Framework to [[platform_business_models | Platform Business Models]]

Platforms are particularly intriguing due to their complexity, idiosyncratic nature, and their creation of tremendous value in today's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:25">[10:36:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:30">[11:11:30]</a>. Most of the most valuable companies today operate on some form of [[platform_business_models | platform model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

### Defining Platforms

A platform is broadly defined as an intermediary for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. This definition extends beyond modern digital technologies to models with ancient roots, such as Chinese village matchmakers who paired single men and women 3,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. The core idea is that a platform facilitates exchange between heterogeneous buyers and sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

### Technology as a Driver

While platforms are not bounded by a particular form of technology, technology is the key driver for new platforms to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. Technology dramatically lowers transaction costs, such as search costs, information input costs, and delivery costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. This reduction in friction enables the creation of entirely new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. For example, mobile phones made it possible to conduct transactions and discoveries that were previously unfeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>.

However, the paradox is that the very ease with which technology enables platforms to spin up quickly can also make it easy for competitors to catch up, as these friction-reducing technologies are widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.

### Three Key Questions for Assessing [[platform_power_and_competitive_advantage | Platform Power]]

To understand and assess the power of a platform, three critical questions should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>:

1.  **How is economic value created on your platform, and how does that value change as your platform becomes larger or has more participants?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a> This question focuses on the "benefit" side of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>.
2.  **How does each group of your customers perceive their economic value from your platform, and how does that change as your platform gets larger?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a> This considers how different segments of users (e.g., buyers and sellers) experience the value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.
3.  **What is preventing your competitors from getting to equivalence in that value proposition?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a> This question addresses the "barrier" side of power, identifying what makes a platform's advantage sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.

It's crucial to consider all three questions carefully, as the second is not worth asking if the first isn't creating much value, and the third reveals the sustainability of that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Uber/Lyft (Ride-sharing)

*   **Value Creation (Question 1)**: Ride-sharing platforms like Uber match heterogeneous drivers and passengers, who are time and location stamped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Greater density (more drivers, more passengers) allows for more efficient route structures, primarily by minimizing driver downtime rather than changing drive time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>. This leads to better "fit" between supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:06]</a>.
*   **Value Perception (Question 2)**: As density increases in a specific geographical region, wait times for drivers decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>. However, this function is often not linear and has diminishing marginal utility; the curve flattens out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.
*   **Competitive Barriers (Question 3)**: A significant challenge for ride-sharing platforms is "multi-homing," where customers (both riders and drivers) can frictionlessly access competing platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>. If users routinely open multiple apps to find the closest ride or driver, then relative scale doesn't matter, and any differential value generated by one platform's size is arbitraged away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>. This can lead to a situation where much value is created, but the platform owner doesn't capture it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>. The undifferentiated experience of a ride makes it easy for meta-search platforms to reduce friction further, enabling customers to arbitrage power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>. The "heterogeneity of preferences" is low; users primarily care about distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>.

### YouTube

*   **Value Creation (Question 1)**: YouTube deals with high levels of "heterogeneity of preferences" for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>. Users care about many dimensions (language, theme, music, production quality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>. This means the scale required to achieve "good enough" content variety is much higher, making the diminishing returns curve flatten very slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>.
*   **Value Perception (Question 2)**: YouTube provides high value to users because it accumulates a unique set of knowledge about user preferences and content quality, which dramatically reduces search costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>. This is true for both users who search for specific content and those who rely on YouTube's algorithms to surface enjoyable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>. Creators and advertisers also perceive high value from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:00">[29:37:00]</a>.
*   **Competitive Barriers (Question 3)**: Despite the relatively low cost for creators to multi-home their content to other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>, YouTube maintains power due to the strong friction on the viewer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:00">[33:39:00]</a>. The accumulated knowledge about user tastes and watch time (a crucial input for algorithms) makes searching and discovering content on YouTube much easier than on a copycat platform, even if the latter had the same content catalog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>. This allows YouTube to charge mindshare from users, which is then monetized through advertising dollars paid to creators, creating a powerful self-reinforcing loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a>.

### Amazon vs. eBay Sellers

This example illustrates how different customer segments perceive economic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:40:00">[36:40:00]</a>. An Amazon seller, with an established supply chain, optimizes for selling more units at a market price. Their decision to use a different platform depends on the potential for increased unit sales versus the cost of managing another platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>. An eBay seller auctioning an antique watch, conversely, seeks the highest possible price for a single, unique item. Their decision is driven by the likelihood of a buyer with a higher willingness to pay appearing on a platform with more participants, which increases the chance of better matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>. Understanding these distinct motivations is crucial for platform operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:12:00">[38:12:00]</a>.

### Apple vs. [[tsmcs_partnerships_and_business_strategies | TSMC]]

This comparison explores the strategy of maximizing enterprise value through pricing and value extraction.

*   **Apple**: Apple is seen by some as "overly extractive" with practices like the 30% App Store fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:46:00">[49:46:00]</a>. This strategy is possible because Apple is a vertically integrated company controlling its entire stack (software and hardware), funding capital expenditures through hardware sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:00]</a>. Consumers often don't switch due to high switching costs (e.g., moving from iPhone to Android) and a lack of awareness or care about Apple's take rate, while developers continue to build for iOS due to the affluent customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:05:00">[59:05:00]</a>.
*   **[[tsmcs_partnerships_and_business_strategies | TSMC]]**: In contrast, [[tsmcs_partnerships_and_business_strategies | TSMC]] does not charge the maximum possible to its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>. This is a deliberate strategic decision to forgo current profits for future revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:37:00">[51:37:00]</a>. Their business operates under unusual conditions:
    *   **Lumpy Capital**: New fabs cost tens of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:12:00">[52:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Predictable Performance Advances**: The adherence to "Moore's Law" provides a high assurance of technology improvement with the right choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:26:00">[52:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Reliance on Upstream Suppliers**: Key technology advantages are driven by suppliers like ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:52:00">[52:52:00]</a>.
    This strategy allows [[tsmcs_partnerships_and_business_strategies | TSMC]] to secure forward guarantees from customers (like Nvidia), enabling massive capital commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:50:00">[53:50:00]</a>. This customer comfort and access to scarce resources (like ASML's machines) allow them to be a technology leader, which translates to a cost and performance advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:33:00">[56:33:00]</a>. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy of future profits, demonstrating a long-term approach to maintaining [[geopolitical_implications_of_tsmcs_dominance | TSMC's dominance]] and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:37:00">[57:37:00]</a>.

## Distinguishing Concepts

### Product-Market Fit vs. Power

Achieving product-market fit (creating value for customers) is an amazing and difficult accomplishment, but it is distinct from achieving power (capturing value for the company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:29:00">[39:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. A business model that achieves product-market fit may or may not have an embedded power opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>. The challenge of creating power in a business that currently lacks it can be as difficult as achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:00">[40:07:00]</a>. Companies can experience rapid growth and traction (the "takeoff phase") due to product-market fit, but later face the question of whether this is a profitable proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09:00">[45:09:00]</a>.

### Network Effects vs. Network Economies

*   **Network Effects**: Occur when a new participant joining a network makes the entire network more valuable to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. For example, a driver joining Uber makes the platform more valuable to passengers due to more efficient routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>. This describes value creation without considering competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>.
*   **Network Economies**: A term under debate, currently defined as when [[platform_power_and_competitive_advantage | power]] results from direct network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>. A direct network effect is when a user joining has an immediate value impact on others on the same side of the platform (e.g., joining Facebook because friends are there, making the site more valuable through additive connections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. These can lead to winner-take-all situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. For a network effect to translate into network economies (power), it must be material and arbitragable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.

### Flywheels

Flywheels are a sign of product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. They describe how various parts of a business feed into each other to create growth and scale, addressing issues of critical mass and ignition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. However, flywheels themselves tell nothing about power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>. A thought experiment to test this is to swap a company's logo on its flywheel with a competitor's; if it still works, it suggests the flywheel doesn't inherently create power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. Often, the same technology that enables a flywheel to spin quickly also enables multi-homing and easy competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

## Advice for Founders

Founders should not be content with merely achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>. If a company doesn't develop power, it can become an undesirable place to work, losing its best talent and failing to become iconic or durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. The power question is a "second hill to climb" that founders, accustomed to hard challenges, should approach positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

When considering increasing profitability or reducing subsidies on a platform, companies must assess their "surplus leader margin" – the maximum price they can charge while maintaining their competitive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This is dependent on the differential scale compared to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. There is an active trade-off between market share and differential margin; early-stage companies may sacrifice short-term margin for larger market share, with the expectation of realizing profits later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

Regarding customer lock-in and switching costs, companies should prioritize creating value for their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. If that value proposition naturally leads to customer loyalty and switching costs, then so be it. However, focusing solely on lock-in without prioritizing value creation can lead to "win-lose propositions" that ultimately fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Platforms must constantly prove they provide enough value for customers to pay a cut and stay on the platform, rather than transacting directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

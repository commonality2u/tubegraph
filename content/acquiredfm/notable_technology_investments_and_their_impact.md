This article explores the landscape of notable [[The Role of Technology in Investing | technology investments]] and their profound [[impact of technological disruption on business valuations | impact on business valuations]] and market dynamics, with a particular focus on the venture capital firm Benchmark and its unique approach to the industry.

## The Venture Capital Landscape in the 1990s

In the early 1990s, the venture capital landscape in [[Silicon Valley and VC industry trends | Silicon Valley]] was dominated by a few key players. John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins was considered the "800-pound gorilla" in the VC ecosystem, especially leading up to and during the internet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Other prominent firms included Sequoia (which had backed Cisco and was about to invest in Yahoo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, Greylock, Venrock (the venture arm of the Rockefeller family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, and early institutional firms like IVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

Some lesser-known firms, like Technology Venture Investors (TVI) and Merrill Pickard Anderson and Eyre, also played significant roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. These two firms notably shared an office building on Sand Hill Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. TVI gained unique prominence as the only [[Market dynamics and investment strategies in the tech industry | venture capital investor]] in Microsoft, investing $1 million to own five percent of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Merrill Pickard had success with investments like Palm Pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a> and Rambus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

> [!note] The Microsoft Investment
> Dave Marquardt of TVI, who led the Microsoft investment, believed the venture business was an "intensely personal relationship business" that didn't scale well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. He asserted that companies should handle value-added services themselves, and that "VCS are there to support and be steady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. This philosophy foreshadowed Benchmark's future approach.

## The Founding of Benchmark

The desire for an "equal partnership" and equitable distribution of rewards led to internal tensions within firms like TVI and Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Bob Kagle, a partner at TVI, was a strong proponent of this model, believing anything less was "morally wrong" for a venture capital firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. After his firm declared "victory" and ceased operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>, Kagle approached Bruce Dunleavy of Merrill Pickard with the idea of starting a new firm based on equal partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

Joined by Andy Ratcliffe and entrepreneur Kevin Harvey, these four became the well-known founders of Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. A fifth co-founder, Val Vaden, who specialized in software company buyouts, also joined initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

Benchmark Capital, audacious in its name, aimed to "set a new Benchmark for performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. They sought a 30% carry (profit share), a premium to the industry standard 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>, signaling their premium positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. This move drew strong reactions; some LPs, like Horsley Bridge, made a significant bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>, while others, like Stanford University, actively organized against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. Benchmark Fund One closed at $85 million and became one of the best-performing venture funds in [[history of technology companies | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.

Despite a rocky start, including Val Vaden's departure in late 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>, Benchmark maintained its commitment to equal partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. They recruited David Beirne, a top executive recruiter, who brought a "swagger" and "hustler" mentality back to the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

### Key Investment Highlights

#### Webvan (Early Investment)

David Beirne's first major deal was Webvan, an ambitious e-commerce business aiming to be an "online Walmart" starting with groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>. While later known as a cautionary tale of the .com excesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>, Benchmark's $3.5 million investment (split with Sequoia) in a $7 million round was seen as a "great bet" for its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. The company went public and traded up to an $8 billion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>, demonstrating a willingness to take asymmetric risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

#### eBay (The Big One)

eBay, then known as Auction Web, was a side project by engineer Pierre Omidyar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. It rapidly gained traffic and, reluctantly, Omidyar began charging small listing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. This demonstrated clear "product market fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>. Benchmark invested $6.7 million at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>, gaining over 20% equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>. They also reportedly provided equity-backed loans to Omidyar and Jeff Skoll to incentivize them not to take a $50 million acquisition offer from Knight Ridder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>.

The investment paid off massively. By eBay's IPO in September 1998, Benchmark's stake was worth $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. When the lockup expired in Spring 1999, it was worth over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>. This single investment, from an $85 million fund, delivered over 47x the fund's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>, resulting in $1.5 billion in carry to be distributed among the equal partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:49">[01:25:49]</a>.

> [!quote] "Non-consensus and Right"
> The success of eBay epitomized Benchmark's willingness to make "correct non-consensus" bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:43">[03:15:43]</a>. At the time, an investment in a company facilitating sales of "beanie babies" seemed illogical to many, but it tapped into the latent power of the internet for commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:52">[03:10:52]</a>. This approach was later articulated by partners like Bill Gurley and Andy Ratcliffe, emphasizing that to make money in investing, one must be both non-consensus and right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a>.

#### Accept.com

Benchmark's firm, through an entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) program, incubated Accept.com, a company designed to handle internet payments, specifically for eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:39">[02:26:39]</a>. Though eBay initially pulled out of investing, Amazon acquired Accept.com for $175 million in Amazon stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:21">[02:28:21]</a>. This deal fostered a long-standing relationship between Jeff Bezos and Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>.

## Benchmark's "Imperial Era" and Challenges

Following eBay's success, Benchmark faced new decisions. They considered raising a much larger fund, expanding internationally, and forming corporate partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. They raised a $1 billion fourth fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:01">[02:18:01]</a>, expanded to Europe and Israel, and recruited new partners for these international ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:08">[02:19:08]</a>.

However, this period also saw significant "misses":
*   **Google**: Benchmark had an opportunity but "failed to pursue" it with their typical hyper-competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:14">[02:23:14]</a>.
*   **Skype**: Due to internal debates between the Menlo Park and Europe funds, Benchmark lost the deal for Skype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:12">[02:25:12]</a>.
*   **Facebook**: Benchmark was conflicted out because they had invested in Friendster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:15">[02:26:15]</a>.

These missed opportunities, coupled with venturing into non-core activities like late-stage mezzanine investments, led to a period of "wandering in the woods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:06">[02:59:06]</a>. Eventually, the partners decided to return to their core focus: early-stage investing in Silicon Valley with right-sized funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>. This involved spinning off their international funds (which became Balderton in Europe and Olive in Israel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:30">[03:02:30]</a> and a generational transfer of partners, with the departing founders making a clean break without "tail economics" in new funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:03">[03:11:03]</a>.

## The "Fab Four" Era and Beyond

The refocusing led to the recruitment of new partners, establishing the "Fab Four" era: Bill Gurley, Peter Fenton, Mitch Laskey, and Matt Cohler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:07">[02:41:07]</a>.

*   **Bill Gurley**: Joined in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:03">[02:14:03]</a>. Known for his analytical approach and expertise in marketplaces, Gurley invested in companies like OpenTable, Zillow, GrubHub, and ODesk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:12">[02:14:12]</a>. He championed Series A investing post-product-market-fit, recognizing the mispricing in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>.
*   **Peter Fenton**: Joined from Accel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:14">[02:34:14]</a>. His investments included Twitter, Docker, Zora, Hortonworks, New Relic, and Elastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:51">[02:37:51]</a>. He was a key investor in open-source software and enterprise adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:06">[02:52:06]</a>.
*   **Mitch Laskey**: A founder and CEO in the games industry, Laskey's notable investments include Snap and Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>.
*   **Matt Cohler**: Employee number five at Facebook, Cohler brought deep expertise in consumer social products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:28">[02:41:28]</a>. He understood the impact of [[Cloud infrastructure and investment strategies | AWS]] and the shift to data-driven Series A investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:05">[02:42:05]</a>. His investments include Instagram (which returned the fund upon its sale to Facebook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a> and Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:55">[02:46:55]</a>.

> [!note] The Uber Investment
> Bill Gurley, having previously searched for a company to disrupt the taxi industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>, led Benchmark's $10 million Series A investment in Uber in 2011 at a $60 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:39">[02:56:39]</a>. This was a key investment from Fund Seven, which became one of the best-performing funds of its size, sitting on a 25x return before fees by 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:13">[03:08:13]</a>. Benchmark later sold significant portions of its Uber stake to SoftBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:47">[02:54:47]</a>.

The firm's philosophy during this period was captured by Matt Cohler: "Our job as [[Market dynamics and investment strategies in the tech industry | venture capitalists]] is not to see the future, but to see the present very clearly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">[02:43:02]</a>. This focus on present data and traction in a rapidly growing mobile and [[Cultural and Economic Trends in Technology and Investment | consumer technology]] market allowed them to make highly successful bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:26">[02:43:26]</a>.

The Uber investment, however, also marked the end of the "Fab Four" era. Disputes arose between Benchmark (as a board member) and founder Travis Kalanick, leading to Benchmark suing Kalanick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:13">[03:00:13]</a>. This high-profile conflict, while not directly damaging Benchmark's reputation long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:06">[03:09:06]</a>, contributed to the eventual retirement of Matt Cohler, Mitch Laskey, and Bill Gurley from active partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:11">[03:10:11]</a>.

## Current Benchmark Partnership

Today, the Benchmark partnership consists of Peter Fenton (the last remaining from the "Fab Four"), Eric Vishria, Sarah Tavel, Chethan Puttagunta, and Miles Grimshaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:43">[03:19:43]</a>.

*   **Eric Vishria**: Joined in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:40">[03:10:40]</a>. His investments include Confluent, Amplitude, and Benchling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>.
*   **Sarah Tavel**: Joined in 2017 as the first woman GP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:01">[03:13:01]</a>. Known for consumer and marketplace investing, her first investment was the non-consensus crypto winter deal Chainalysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:56">[03:14:56]</a>.
*   **Chethan Puttagunta**: Joined in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:02">[03:17:02]</a>. His successes include Elastic, MuleSoft, and MongoDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
*   **Miles Grimshaw**: The most recent addition, joining in 2021 from Thrive Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:40">[03:18:40]</a>, where he was involved with companies like Dinner Table and Benchling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:08">[03:19:08]</a>.

## The Benchmark Playbook

Benchmark's [[Business strategy and impact of technology | business strategy]] is characterized by several key elements:

*   **Equal Partnership**: This core tenet ensures that all active General Partners share economics equally, fostering a culture of trust and discouraging internal competition for credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>. It requires every partner to bring an "equal level" of effort and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:09">[01:46:09]</a>.
*   **Boutique by Design**: Benchmark famously believes that [[The Role of Technology in Investing | venture capital doesn't scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. They have intentionally kept their fund size modest and avoided junior partners, platform teams, or multi-stage investing, aiming for focused partner attention on a limited number of board seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>.
*   **Founder-Focused**: Benchmark positions itself as service providers to founders, emphasizing their support role rather than taking credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>. They seek "psychological safety" for their partners to make the riskiest, correct decisions, which allows them to fully support entrepreneurs without conflicting incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:53">[03:32:53]</a>.
*   **All-Star Team Dynamic**: The firm consistently recruits experienced, fiercely competitive yet collaborative investors who are at the top of their game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:16">[02:04:16]</a>. This ensures high-level contribution from every partner.
*   **Learning Machines**: Benchmark partners are constantly learning and adapting. They invite CEOs of companies they missed to dinners to understand their mistakes and adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:20">[03:40:20]</a>. They are experimental, willing to break their own "rules" when it makes sense, such as holding public company stock when undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:01">[03:41:01]</a>.
*   **Branding Power**: Benchmark's reputation means their capital is perceived as more valuable, often allowing them to invest at lower valuations for the same stake compared to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:28">[03:32:28]</a>. This "Benchmark stamp" often de-risks subsequent funding rounds for their portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:51">[03:34:51]</a>.

Benchmark's ability to consistently generate outsized returns across generations, despite (or perhaps because of) its unique, anti-scaling model, solidifies its position as a benchmark in the [[Silicon Valley successes and failures | venture capital industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:02">[02:59:02]</a>.

[[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]] is a feature of [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] that allows organizations to communicate and collaborate with external partners, clients, and other companies within a shared channel environment. This functionality was a significant strategic asset for [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] and played a key role in its acquisition by Salesforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>.

## Strategic Importance for Slack

For [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] as an independent company, [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]] was crucial for several reasons:

*   **Bridging Internal and External Communication**: Historically, [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] was primarily an internal communication tool, with email serving as the external standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]] aimed to make [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] a primary external communication tool as well, potentially "killing email" for business-to-business interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:59">[03:39:59]</a>.
*   **"Try Before You Buy" Model**: [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]] served as an effective customer acquisition strategy. If an innovative partner like Stripe or Amazon suggested communicating via a shared [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] channel, other companies (e.g., law firms, finance firms) would join and experience the product firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:50">[03:08:50]</a>. The belief was that once users tried [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]], they would appreciate its superiority over alternatives like [[microsoft_teams_vs_slack | Microsoft Teams]] and potentially adopt it for their own organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.
*   **Growth Metrics**: [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]] endpoints showed rapid growth, increasing from 380,000 to 520,000 in just one quarter, representing a 240% year-over-year increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This indicated strong adoption and focus for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Importance in the Salesforce Acquisition

[[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]] was identified as a highly appealing feature for Salesforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, playing a crucial role in the strategic rationale for the acquisition:

*   **Integration with Salesforce Customer 360**: Salesforce envisioned [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] becoming the "operating system for the new way to work" and the "new interface for Salesforce Customer 360" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The idea was that sales teams could initiate [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]] channels directly from their leads within Salesforce, tracking conversations and humanizing the sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution Channel**: The acquisition was seen as a "distribution deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Salesforce's massive sales force could push [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] into large organizations where it had previously struggled to gain a foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This would allow [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] to grow with its customers and leverage Salesforce's credibility as a "trustworthy vendor" for large-scale adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Building Network Effects**: [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]] fosters network effects by creating links between companies, making the entire ecosystem more valuable as more participants join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Platforms

*   **Vs. Microsoft Teams**: Unlike [[microsoft_teams_vs_slack | Microsoft Teams]], which often emphasizes video conferencing (more akin to Zoom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> and is architected differently with limitations on team setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]] focuses on facilitating communication between distinct organizations. Microsoft's strategy with Teams was seen as a direct threat to [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]]'s position as a potential "hub for essentially an office suite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Vs. Discord**: While Discord targets gaming and influencer communities with greater customizability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>, [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]] focuses on enterprise-level inter-company collaboration and integration with business tools. Discord's business model, which charges for upgraded features rather than per user, also differs from [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]]'s enterprise focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The acquisition of [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] by Salesforce, largely underpinned by the strategic value of [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack Connect]], represents a significant move to compete with integrated suites like Microsoft 365 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. The success of this move hinges on whether [[slack_and_salesforce_acquisition_details | Slack]] can maintain its innovative edge and appeal to new, high-growth companies while integrating with Salesforce's enterprise reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. There is a risk that the product could "atrophy" under Salesforce, making it less attractive to the "next generation" of companies that might opt for newer collaboration software, thus becoming an "existential risk" in an "F scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

The "American Dynamism" thesis, championed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), focuses on investing in companies that support the national interest and interact with government sectors, a shift from traditional [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture capital]] norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. This approach challenges the long-held Silicon Valley sentiment of avoiding government engagement and aims to bring technological innovation to critical, often physical, sectors of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.

## The American Dynamism Thesis

Katherine Boyle, a General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, leads the American Dynamism practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>. The simplest definition of this thesis is "companies that support the national interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This includes:
*   Companies that sell directly to government, such as aerospace and defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Companies addressing areas every citizen cares about, including education, housing, transportation, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

Historically, the last 30 years of software innovation largely hasn't touched these physical spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. However, a16z observed that some of their most significant portfolio companies actually fall into this category, outside of traditional consumer or enterprise technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. These companies become large, impacting most people in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Why this is a New Vertical for Venture Capital

While some sectors like digital health have seen tremendous [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture capital]] growth, areas such as education and housing have not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Post-COVID-19, there is a strong founder appetite for innovating a 21st-century education model, as the existing 19th-century model proved insufficient during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. These "big categories" are often government-funded and require private sector technologists to transform them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Historical Disconnect Between Silicon Valley and Government

Traditionally, Silicon Valley has tried to "stay as far away as possible" from government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This is ironic given that Silicon Valley was initially built on defense investment, with early [[role_of_venture_capitalists_and_angel_investors | venture capitalists]] like Don Valentine selling to the Department of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

The modern wisdom in [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture capital]] has been to "do not engage" with government due to perceived difficulties:
*   These are "hard sectors" that are not "pure software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   They often involve regulatory capture and entrenched interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   Companies in these sectors are harder to build, often requiring more capital upfront and longer periods before generating returns (going "deeper down the j-curve") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. For example, SpaceX faced significant worry for its first 10 years about investor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

Government's internal building philosophy also clashed with the tech sector's "build or buy" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Government continues to use taxpayer dollars to build internally, contributing to bloated budgets and the high cost of civic goods like education, housing, and healthcare, which haven't been touched by cost-reducing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

## Why Now? The Changing Dynamics

The timing for the American Dynamism thesis is crucial, influenced by several factors:
*   **COVID-19** acted as a catalyst, fundamentally changing the world and highlighting areas needing technological transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Changing Talent Pool**: The "talent" in Silicon Valley has diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. People are now leaving traditional careers (e.g., government, teaching) to solve "real problems" with technology, leveraging off-the-shelf tools that reduce the need for extensive infrastructure knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Impact of Pop Culture**: Films like "The Social Network" (released in 2011) inspired a generation to become founders, merging traditional "culture" with "counterculture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   **Decentralization of Tech Hubs**: The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that companies and talent do not need to be exclusively in San Francisco or New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Founders can build from anywhere, including their hometowns, leading to a "democratization of tech" across America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. The remote work movement will further spur new companies in "second and third cities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

## Case Studies of American Dynamism

The American Dynamism thesis is being implemented through companies addressing critical civic needs:

### Flock Safety
Flock Safety, a Y Combinator company built in Atlanta by Garrett Langley, aims to eliminate crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. Recognizing that many crimes involve cars and existing license plate readers were expensive, Langley built a small camera license plate reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>. It initially sold to homeowners' associations, focusing on tracking cars, not people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. These cameras began solving dangerous crimes like child kidnappings, leading to police chiefs contacting them inbound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. Flock Safety now operates in 30 states, exemplifying an American Dynamism company that solves civic needs, eventually selling to government, but built from a community perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

### Hadrian
Hadrian is a Los Angeles-based company building automated machine shops for aerospace and defense manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. The founder, Chris Power, initially considered a private equity fund to acquire existing machine shops, but realized their technical limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. He opted to build new, automated machine shops from scratch, focused on upskilling American workers with technical competence, moving away from artisan knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. Hadrian serves large aerospace and defense companies and the new space sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

The need for new defense contractors built with modern technology has become clear on the world stage, particularly with events like the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>.

## Culture of Scarcity vs. Abundance

The distinction between Washington D.C. and Silicon Valley cultures profoundly impacts their interaction:
*   **Washington D.C.** operates in a "culture of scarcity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. Its currency is power, which is scarce and hierarchical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. There can only be one "winner" of the news cycle or the most powerful person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. It's a "zero-sum" mindset, reinforced by two-to-four-year election cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
*   **Silicon Valley** embodies a "culture of abundance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>. Its currency is equity and financial success, which is not finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. This fosters a positive-sum mentality where founders help other founders, and [[role_of_venture_capitalists_and_angel_investors | venture capitalists]] can have portfolios of winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. This culture encourages growth and creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

This fundamental difference in incentives makes it difficult for them to interact naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

## The Role of Venture Capital in this Transformation

[[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | Venture capital]] is seen as a force for creating new things, jobs, and solving problems with modern technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. This contrasts with private equity, which is described as consolidating old companies and creating value from existing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

The focus on "small tech" companies — businesses that start from the "napkin stage" and aim to grow large — is particularly exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. These are small businesses that use built tools to enable new types of businesses, whether through platforms like Substack or Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The "American Dynamism" thesis is seen as a "big swing" for a16z, with the hope that it will become a standard investment category for all [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture capital]] firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. It is not considered "impact investing" or "ESG," but rather a source of significant American innovation and tremendous returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

The goal is to extend the incentive alignment of Silicon Valley across the entire country, so that innovation and opportunities are not unique to a specific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. This movement of decentralization is viewed as "a really good thing for the rest of the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. As technology permeates every sector, even those without initially high gross margins, attacking broad swaths of the American economy will lead to the creation of very large businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

[[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], a company with a century-long history, is behind the sensational diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This pharmaceutical giant is unique as the vast majority of its revenue is concentrated in metabolic health, having been the insulin and diabetes company for the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## The Global Burden of Diabetes and Obesity
The statistics surrounding weight, diabetes, and their societal impact are staggering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>:
*   **Diabetes**:
    *   38 million Americans (1 in 10) have diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
    *   Globally, over 500 million people have the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
    *   Diabetes costs the US alone more than $327 billion a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Obesity**:
    *   Around a billion people worldwide suffer from obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
    *   40% of the US population is obese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
    *   Expanding to overweight, 75% of Americans are technically overweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

This massive market is why [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] became Europe's largest company, surpassing LVMH in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Origins of GLP1 Agonists
The molecule semaglutide, found in Ozempic and Wegovy, was pioneered by [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] with its first trial in 2008 for type 2 diabetes treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This built on research that began in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. The surprising discovery that GLP1 drugs could reduce food intake was made in the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. However, it wasn't until 2021 that clinical trials conclusively demonstrated its effectiveness for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### The Pioneering Work of Lotte Bjerre Knudsen
A small group of researchers within [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], led by Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, were working on [[insulin_market_dynamics_and_innovations | GLP1 Agonist]] drugs in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Knudsen started at [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] in 1989 as a scientist in the enzyme division before moving to the diabetes business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

In the early to mid-1990s, Knudsen delved into academic research, finding new work indicating that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) played a significant role in disrupting insulin production in type 2 diabetes patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. The challenge was that natural GLP1 only remains active in the body for about five minutes before being metabolized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

After facing internal pressure to abandon the research, Knudsen developed a GLP1 analog called liraglutide, which included a fatty acid grafted onto the molecule to prevent rapid breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This breakthrough extended its half-life in the human body to 13 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, allowing it to become a once-a-day drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. The fatty acid helps GLP1 bind to albumin, a large protein in the bloodstream, protecting it from enzymatic degradation and rapid kidney clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### First-Generation GLP1 Agonists: Liraglutide (Victoza and Saxenda)
In 2007, Knudsen's liraglutide began Phase 3 human clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. During these trials, researchers observed that rats injected with large amounts of liraglutide would stop eating and had reduced appetites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This effect also persisted in human trials, a surprising finding, especially since many other anti-diabetic drugs caused weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

Despite initial company reluctance and the prevailing stigma against weight loss drugs, Knudsen and her team advocated for pursuing a parallel FDA approval pathway for liraglutide as a weight management drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. The commercial opportunity was immense, given that by the mid-2000s, approximately one-third of the US population was medically obese, and two-thirds were overweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

In early 2010, [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] received final approval for **Victoza**, the marketing name for the diabetes version of liraglutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Victoza was an enormous hit, generating approximately $300 million in sales in its first year and over $1 billion in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This rapid success led it to become a "Blockbuster drug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, though much of its use was off-label for weight loss, as doctors could prescribe it at their discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

In late 2013, [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] submitted **Saxenda**, a slightly higher-dose version of liraglutide, for official weight loss approval to the FDA and EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. While a hit with good sales, it didn't meet the high expectations, yielding an average of about an 8% BMI reduction, just below the "magical 10% weight loss reduction" threshold believed to be necessary for a widespread market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

### Competitors and the Gila Monster
In parallel with Knudsen's work, in 2005, the world's first [[insulin_market_dynamics_and_innovations | GLP1 Agonist]] drug, **Byetta**, came to market for type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Developed by Eli Lilly, Byetta was based on a hormone found in the venom of the Gila monster lizard, discovered by two American researchers in the VA hospital system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This naturally occurring GLP1 analog didn't break down quickly in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

While effective and safe, Byetta required two injections per day, making it less convenient than a once-daily or once-weekly drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Second-Generation GLP1 Agonists: Semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy)
Around 2016, [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] began Phase 3 trials for their next-generation GLP1 analog, semaglutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Semaglutide offered several significant benefits over liraglutide:
1.  **Longer Lasting**: It only needed to be injected once per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
2.  **Higher Efficacy**: It was twice as effective for weight loss, achieving a 15% or more long-term BMI reduction, surpassing the 10% "magical threshold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

This compound, semaglutide, is marketed as **Ozempic** for diabetes and **Wegovy** for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. An oral version, **Rybelsus**, is also available, offering a once-daily pill alternative, though it is slightly less effective than the injectable form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### How Semaglutide Works
Semaglutide works primarily through two mechanisms:
1.  **Appetite Suppression**: The natural GLP1 produced in the gut travels to the brain, signaling satiety and reducing hunger fixation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Slowed Digestion**: It slows down the movement of food through the digestive system, making individuals feel fuller for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

The combination of these effects leads to significant weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. While not a "magic" solution for eating pizza and ice cream, it helps change habits naturally by reducing cravings and portion sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and constipation, which can lead about one in six patients to discontinue the drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

### Market Impact and Growth
Ozempic officially hit the market for diabetes in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, followed by Wegovy's approval for weight loss in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Ozempic generated over $1 billion in revenue in its first year (2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, but its sales, along with Wegovy's, have been significantly supply-constrained due to overwhelming demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

In February 2021, *The New York Times* called semaglutide a "game-changer," stating it was the first drug shown to be so effective against obesity that patients might avoid many of its worst consequences, including diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

[[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]]'s market cap surged, reaching $250 billion by summer 2021, $300 billion by late 2022, and flirting with $500 billion in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Annual revenue increased from $20 billion in 2019 to $30 billion in 2022, with a 30% year-on-year increase in the first three quarters of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

Currently, 51% of [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]]'s revenue comes from diabetes-focused [[insulin_market_dynamics_and_innovations | GLP1 Agonist]] drugs, and an additional 18% comes from obesity-related GLP1s, totaling 69% of their revenue from semaglutide or liraglutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. [[insulin_market_dynamics_and_innovations | Insulin]] now accounts for 22% of revenue, and rare diseases for 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. The company boasts extremely high gross margins, around 84% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Future Potential: New Indications
Because semaglutide has such a long half-life, it reaches other tissues in the body where GLP1s wouldn't normally go, showing potential benefits for those organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] is currently conducting clinical trials for semaglutide in treating cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, and kidney disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This indicates that the same drug, already deemed safe for accepted uses, may also address other major disease areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Challenges
### Pricing and Access
The sticker price for Ozempic (diabetes) is over $1,000 per month, and for Wegovy (weight loss) is over $1,300 per month in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. In contrast, Ozempic costs $147 a month in Canada and $93 a month in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

For most Americans, the actual cost after insurance is around $300 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, representing a significant out-of-pocket expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This leads to a meaningful access problem, even with highly subsidized rates, as many people cannot afford the drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

### Insurance Coverage and Incentive Alignment
The US [[healthcare_system_challenges_and_pharmaceutical_economics | healthcare system]] presents deep issues of incentive alignment and time horizon:
*   **Private Insurers**: The average American holds a job for 3.7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Insurance companies' incentives align with covering issues that pay back within that timeframe or are in high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Long-term benefits, like preventing future obesity-related complications costing hundreds of thousands or millions, are not realized by current insurers or employers, who pass costs onto future plans or Medicare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Medicare**: Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage) was passed in 2003 and took effect in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. However, it is legally prohibited from paying for weight loss drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This prohibition is partly due to the historical stigma around obesity being viewed as a personal responsibility problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. If GLP1s prove to significantly reduce long-term complications, it might become ROI positive for Medicare to cover them, as it would prevent much larger future healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

Insurers and employers are currently hesitant to cover these drugs widely due to the massive short-term costs, as 40% of the population is obese and the list price is over $12,000 per person per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### Non-Adherence
Non-adherence is a significant issue; as many as 68% of people stop taking GLP1s after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Reasons include price, insurance changes, supply constraints, and side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. When treatment stops, benefits, including weight loss, typically reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

### Competition
Other major pharmaceutical companies are also bringing GLP1 drugs to market:
*   **Eli Lilly**: Their GLP1 diabetes treatment, **Mounjaro**, appears to be as effective, if not more effective, than semaglutide for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Mounjaro's active ingredient, tirzepatide, combines GLP1 with GIP, bundling two hormones that act in concert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Tirzepatide was approved for diabetes in May 2022 and for official weight loss use as **Zepbound** in November 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   **Future Generations**: [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] has its own next-generation GLP1 drug, CagSema, in the pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Eli Lilly is also working on a triple agonist called retatrutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

## Key Themes in Drug Development
### The Stigma of Weight Loss Drugs
Historically, there has been an enormous stigma around weight loss drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Past "miracle drugs" like Fen-Phen (a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine, popular in the 1990s) led to major heart damage for millions of Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This history, combined with the perception of obesity as a "personal responsibility problem," deterred most pharmaceutical companies from investing in weight loss research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. As recently as 2005, [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]]'s then-CEO stated, "Obesity is primarily a social and cultural problem... there is no business for [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] in that area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

### Pharma as a Venture Business
Pharmaceutical development is a high-risk, high-return venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. The average cost to bring a drug to market is $2.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Out of 100 drugs entering clinical development, only 10 make it to market, and a single one can generate half of the profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Most approved drugs do not even earn back their R&D costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This dynamic necessitates large companies with significant capital to absorb the risk of drug pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

### Industry Focus and Returns
The pharmaceutical industry over the last few decades shifted away from mass-population drugs toward specialty drugs for rare diseases, which command huge price tags (sometimes millions per dose) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This was partly due to the picking of "low-hanging fruit" in mass-market drug discovery and the difficulty of gaining FDA approval for drugs that aren't significantly "better than" existing alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

Despite public perception, the Pharma sector's return on invested capital (ROIC) is comparable to other industries like Trucking or Broadcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. However, the variance between companies has increased, with some, like [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]], significantly outperforming peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Pharma companies are the primary innovators in the [[healthcare_system_challenges_and_pharmaceutical_economics | healthcare system]], bearing the risk of developing new treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

### The Problem with the US Healthcare System
The US [[healthcare_system_challenges_and_pharmaceutical_economics | healthcare system]] consumes 17-18% of GDP, up from 5% in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Despite this, average life expectancy has declined in recent years, largely due to factors outside the healthcare system's control, such as mental health issues and drug overdoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

The system was initially designed to treat acute and infectious diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The next frontier is chronic illnesses, which develop over decades and require a different approach to treatment, regulation, and payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The fragmented nature of the US market, with numerous middlemen (manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), insurance companies, and employers), creates a "middleman mania" that distorts demand signals and prices, making it difficult for a truly functioning market to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

**Note**: The discussion of the [[healthcare_system_challenges_and_pharmaceutical_economics | healthcare system]] here reflects general challenges and is not exclusively tied to GLP1 agonists.

## Bull and Bear Case for GLP1s
### Bull Case
If GLP1s become the next "super cycle" in pharma, there is ample room for multiple competitors like Eli Lilly and [[history_and_evolution_of_novo_nordisk | Novo Nordisk]] to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. The high barriers to entry in this area ensure sustained demand and profitability for leading companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. The continuous development of new, more effective iterations and broader indications for the drugs (e.g., cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's) could lead to sustained blockbuster performance, similar to Humira's over $200 billion in lifetime sales from 11 indications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

### Bear Case
The long-term effects of GLP1s are still being studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Early studies suggest a potential for greater lean muscle mass loss on GLP1s (around 40%) compared to traditional diet and exercise (25%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. A significant "boogeyman" could emerge in the form of unforeseen health risks or a lack of long-term efficacy, preventing the super cycle from playing out over decades as [[insulin_market_dynamics_and_innovations | insulin]] did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Concerns about suicidal thoughts, while not indicated by regulators as a major risk, persist as a narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

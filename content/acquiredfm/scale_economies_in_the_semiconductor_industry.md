## Overview of TSMC's Approach

TSMC's business strategy involves forgoing immediate profits to secure future gains. This approach is aimed at generating future revenues, either through customer retention via loyalty or by acquiring new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The underlying question is whether an increase in customers and future revenue will yield greater differential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, which leads to an examination of [[unusual_scale_economies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | scale economies]] within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Nature of Scale Economies

The semiconductor industry does exhibit [[unusual_scale_economies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | scale economies]], though they are considered quite [[unusual_scale_economies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | unique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This distinctiveness stems from several inherent industry characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Unique Industry Characteristics

The unique characteristics contributing to the [[unusual_scale_economies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | unusual scale economies]] in the semiconductor sector include:

*   **Substantial Capital Investment**
    The industry requires very large, lumpy capital investments. A new fabrication plant (fab) can cost $10 billion or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

*   **Predictable Performance Advances ([[Moores Law and its impact on technology companies | Moore's Law]])**
    There are "quote-unquote predictable material performance advances," famously exemplified by [[Moores Law and its impact on technology companies | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This predictability offers a high assurance of significant technological improvement (e.g., a 10x improvement in 18 months) if the correct technology choices are made, which is an unusual characteristic for most industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

*   **Supplier-Driven Technological Advantages**
    Technological advantages are largely driven by [[Technological advancements and supplier impacts in semiconductors | upstream suppliers]], such as ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This reliance necessitates difficult strategic choices, as seen in past industry discussions regarding technologies like x-ray lithography, where significant investment was made in considering its viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

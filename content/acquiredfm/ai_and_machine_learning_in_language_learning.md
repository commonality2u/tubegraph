Duolingo is particularly well-suited for [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] and machine learning applications because its core mission is to enable a computer to teach languages effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:50:00">[48:50:00]</a>. The goal is to reach a level of instruction comparable to a human teacher, but without the associated high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:50:00">[48:50:00]</a>.

## Applications of AI

### User Engagement and Notifications
Duolingo utilizes an [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI system]] that has been trained over years to determine the optimal time and content for sending notifications to users, encouraging them to return to the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. This system has proven highly successful in boosting user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

### Content Creation with Large Language Models
The advent of [[Transformers and large language models | large language models]] (LLMs), which are particularly adept at handling language, has significantly impacted Duolingo's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:21:00">[49:21:00]</a>.

Previously, a substantial portion of the data required for Duolingo's courses was created semi-manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:35:00">[49:35:00]</a>. Now, most of this content is generated by [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:00">[50:01:00]</a>. This shift offers several advantages:
*   **Cost Efficiency**: It is significantly more affordable than human-driven content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:02:00">[50:02:00]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Development**: Content can be produced much faster, enabling the development of features previously deemed impractical due to their extensive data requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>. For instance, a "Duo radio" feature, which involves two-minute podcast-like lessons, was initially estimated to require five years of content creation but can now be developed in months with LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:17:00">[50:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:03:00">[51:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>. This includes generating audio and ensuring content is engaging across all 40 languages Duolingo supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:35:00">[51:35:00]</a>.

### Conversational Practice
Another significant application of [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] is in enabling conversational practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:00">[52:05:00]</a>. Users can now engage in simulated video calls with Duolingo's animated characters to practice speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:13:00">[52:13:00]</a>. This addresses a common user reluctance to practice with real people, as many prefer not to be judged while speaking a language they are not proficient in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51:00">[52:51:00]</a>.

## Data-Driven Improvement
Duolingo processes over a billion exercises daily, collecting vast amounts of data on how tens of millions of people learn languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>. This data is used to continuously improve teaching methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:01:00">[54:01:00]</a>. The company aims to evolve to a point where its [[AI Builders and technology | AI]]-driven instruction is as effective as a skilled one-on-one human tutor, which currently costs around $50 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:03:00">[54:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:09:00">[54:09:00]</a>. This progress is expected to accelerate due to the dual advancements in [[Transformers and large language models | foundational LLMs]] and Duolingo's ever-growing internal dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:50:00">[54:50:00]</a>.

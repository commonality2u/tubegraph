"American Dynamism" is a core thesis at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), focusing on companies that support the national interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This includes classic industrial sectors like aerospace and defense that sell directly to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. It also extends to areas that every citizen cares about, such as education, housing, and transportation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. These are large categories where, historically, software innovation has not had a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

The thesis aims to support large companies that affect most people in the country, often selling to or competing with government, or operating in heavily regulated sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Why American Dynamism Now?

Catherine Boyle, a General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, highlights several unique tailwinds for this [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | venture investing]] approach:
*   **Post-COVID-19 Shift:** The world fundamentally changed with COVID-19, leading to a realization that existing models, particularly in education, are outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   **Founder Appetite for Innovation:** There's a tremendous founder appetite to innovate on 21st-century models for education and other large, government-funded categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. These categories need the help of technologists and the private sector to transform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Changing Talent Landscape in Silicon Valley:** The talent pool in "Silicon Valley" (understood as an idea, not just a place) is different now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. People from diverse backgrounds, including former teachers or procurement officers from the Department of Defense, are becoming founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. They are motivated to solve real problems and can build companies using off-the-shelf tools without needing to build their own infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Influence of "The Social Network" Movie:** The film, released around 2011, contributed to a cultural shift where being a founder became aspirational, merging the "culture" and "counterculture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.
*   **Decentralization of Tech:** The remote work movement, spurred by COVID-19, has led to a "democratization of tech" across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. Founders can now build large companies from anywhere, including their hometowns, reversing the historical "brain drain" to places like San Francisco and New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This means new companies are sprouting up in "second and third cities" and smaller towns across America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

## Challenges and Counterarguments

Investing in the "physical world" is considered harder than pure software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. These sectors often have:
*   **Entrenched Interests & Regulations:** They have been around for a long time, often with regulatory capture and large, established players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Longer Development Cycles:** Companies in these sectors often "go deeper down the j-curve," meaning initial [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]] [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]] looks bad before returns materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. For example, SpaceX took a decade before investors were confident of a return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Higher Upfront Capital & Technical Risks:** These companies may require more capital upfront and have longer periods of private or [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture-backed]] status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

Despite these challenges, these companies can become "holding companies" quickly, attracting finite talent in fields like aerospace and defense, and facing less competition than typical consumer or enterprise tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Silicon Valley's Evolving Relationship with Government

Historically, Silicon Valley aimed to stay as far away from government as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This is ironic given that Silicon Valley was initially built on defense [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. The perception was that procurement of technology by the government, especially the DoD, was almost impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This led to a "do not engage" wisdom among [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]] firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

However, companies like Palantir and Lyft/Uber were already performing functions traditionally associated with government, such as helping intelligence agencies or transforming public transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. The government is now forced to work more deeply with the private sector because the best software is built externally, not internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Government bureaucracy often operates on outdated technology, leading to frustration among its own employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

The cost of starting a startup has drastically decreased because companies no longer have to build everything from scratch, relying instead on external tools. Government, conversely, continues to build everything internally using taxpayer dollars, contributing to bloat and high costs in civic goods like education and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

*   **Flock Safety:** A Y Combinator company built in Atlanta by Garrett Langley. It developed small, affordable license plate reader cameras to help solve crime, starting with homeowners' associations and eventually being adopted by police departments in 30 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. This exemplifies how a company built to solve a local problem can scale nationally and address civic needs without initially targeting government sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>.
*   **Hadrian:** An early [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]] out of the American Dynamism practice, based in Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>. Founded by Chris Power, an Australian immigrant, it builds automated machine shops for aerospace and defense manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. The company aims to address the impending crisis of retiring baby boomer machine shop owners and the difficulty of modernizing existing facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. Hadrian is creating new, automated machine shops and "upskilling" American workers to become technically competent machinists, bringing in a new generation to the manufacturing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. This is seen as a crucial mission, as failure to provide these services would cause widespread suffering in the hardware and defense industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.
*   **Anduril:** An early [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]] that was initially contrarian and unpopular, but its mission of providing modern defense technology became clear with events like the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

## Philosophical Underpinnings

American Dynamism champions the "American way" as a good thing, viewing America as the "greatest experiment in human history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. It celebrates the fact that many successful founders in the US are foreign-born, seeing them as testaments to the "American dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>.

Key aspects of this philosophy include:
*   **Culture of Abundance:** Silicon Valley fosters a culture where people believe in a growing pie and are willing to take risks, contrasting with Washington D.C.'s "culture of scarcity" where power is finite and zero-sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:54">[01:41:54]</a>.
*   **Creation over Consolidation:** [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | Venture capital]] is distinguished from private equity; while private equity consolidates old companies and cuts jobs, [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]] creates new things from nothing, generating jobs and expanding businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:36">[01:44:36]</a>.
*   **Pride in Success:** Unlike some parts of Silicon Valley or Seattle, places like Miami embody a culture where people are proud of what they have earned and built, reflecting a traditional American dream ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>.
*   **The "Small Tech" Revolution:** Beyond "Big Tech," the rise of "small tech" companies, fueled by [[the_impact_of_technological_advancements_on_entrepreneurship_and_venture_capital | enabling technology]], represents a small business revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>. These small businesses, often started by individual creators or founders outside traditional tech hubs, are focused on solving the country's big problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The goal for American Dynamism is for every [[venture_capital_partnership_models | venture capital]] firm to eventually have such a practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. This is not seen as "impact investing" or "ESG" with incremental returns, but rather as the next major source of American innovation that will drive the country for decades to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>. The category is expected to become as fundamental as enterprise or consumer tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. As [[the_impact_of_technological_advancements_on_entrepreneurship_and_venture_capital | technology]] permeates all aspects of the world, businesses can achieve significant scale by addressing broad segments of the American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:43">[01:48:43]</a>.

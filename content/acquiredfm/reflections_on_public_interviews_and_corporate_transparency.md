Public interviews, particularly those conducted live, offer unique insights into corporate leadership and transparency. The "Acquired Live at Chase Center" event showcased how unscripted, candid discussions can lead to significant revelations and foster a deeper connection with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## The Dynamic Nature of Live Interviews
The process of preparing for such a large-scale event involved confirming key guests like Emily Chang, Daniel X, and Mike Taylor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. However, the true nature of a live [[interview_segments_with_industry_leaders | interview]] often deviates from any pre-planned script. During the event, a guest like Mark was described as "so on" and "threw away the playbook from like the first word out of his mouth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This spontaneity created an "electric feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, where the hosts felt it could be a "historic conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Corporate Transparency and Admitting Mistakes
A key moment demonstrating [[corporate_governance_and_leadership | corporate transparency]] occurred when the hosts framed questions for Mark to help them with "meta episode research live on stage in front of everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. When asked about criticisms of Facebook/Meta, Mark openly stated, "I made a 20-year mistake. I think that the political miscalculation was a 20-year mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. He further clarified that they were "8 years into a 20-year mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This candid admission from a public company CEO was seen as extraordinary, as "nobody else in the world who would say that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, and caused jaws to drop throughout the arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Such moments highlight the value of direct, honest communication from leaders.

## Impact and Future Outlook
The ability of the *Acquired* podcast to host such an event and facilitate these transparent discussions was attributed to strong partnerships, particularly with JP Morgan Payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The partnership was lauded for its ability to achieve something neither party could have done alone, with JP Morgan Payments allowing *Acquired* to "just go be acquired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The event itself, from its scale to the candid [[experiences_and_insights_from_leading_tech_founders | insights from leading tech founders]], left a lasting impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Looking ahead, the hosts acknowledge a mix of wanting to "go big" and also feeling "never again" due to the demands of such large-scale productions and having young families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The question of "What's next?" remains, with a hint towards 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

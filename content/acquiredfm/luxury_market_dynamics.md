Hermès, a company founded in 1837 in Paris, France, has grown to be worth over $200 billion despite rejecting manufacturing efficiencies and economies of scale characteristic of most industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. Unlike other luxury brands that have merged into conglomerates, Hermès has maintained its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:41">[01:32:41]</a>. Its unique approach to the market defines its place in the luxury industry.

## Evolution of Status and Consumption
The company's initial success was intertwined with the changing dynamics of 19th-century France. Under Napoleon III, Paris was modernized, with grand boulevards designed to showcase wealth and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. This era also saw a shift where status was no longer solely about birthright; individuals could now buy their way into a higher class, making products that signified wealth highly desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>. This created a [[importance_of_product_excellence_and_market_timing | disruption wave]] that enabled businesses like Hermès to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.

The transition from the horse-drawn carriage era to the automobile era was another critical [[importance_of_product_excellence_and_market_timing | market timing]] for Hermès. While Louis Vuitton's luggage designs translated directly to the modern world of trains and cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>, Hermès, with its deep roots in equestrian craftsmanship, had to adapt its offerings. The introduction of the *Haut à Courroies* bag, initially an accessory for carrying saddles, unexpectedly became the spiritual heritage for the modern handbag business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:23">[02:00:23]</a>.

## Luxury vs. Premium
The luxury market operates differently from the premium market. Premium products offer increased utility for a higher price (e.g., more iPhone storage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>. Luxury, however, means paying more *because* it doesn't create more utility; it's either intrinsically pleasing or an extrinsic signal of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. Art is considered luxury taken to its extreme, possessing zero utility but immense value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. Hermès sells not just products, but a piece of art, heritage, and a feeling that connects the customer to the maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.

## Pricing and Scarcity
The Kelly bag, launched in 1956, was initially priced at $900, which today equates to $10,000 to $12,000, similar to its modern price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. At the time, the market of individuals who could afford such an item was significantly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.

Hermès' strategy often defies traditional microeconomics:
*   **Veblen Goods**: The company sells Veblen goods, where demand increases as price increases, as the price signals desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:20">[01:58:20]</a>.
*   **Below Market Clearing Price**: Hermès prices bags like the Birkin below their market clearing price, meaning there's consumer surplus on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:52">[01:58:52]</a>. This deliberate choice creates scarcity, which in turn elevates the brand's status and drives demand for its other products, as customers buy them to build a relationship with the company in hopes of being allocated a coveted bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:52">[01:59:52]</a>.
*   **Price Increases**: While other luxury brands like Chanel have aggressively increased prices, Hermès raises prices across its product line by an average of 7% per year, which is more than inflation but not an egregious amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:51">[03:17:51]</a>. This conservative approach is part of their long-term, generational business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:15">[03:19:15]</a>.

## Brand Identity and Market Positioning
In the 1970s, as other luxury brands like Dior and Chanel began to emerge from the world of couture and fashion, Hermès faced a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. Consultants even recommended outsourcing production and lowering prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. However, Hermès, with over 120 years of history rooted in leather and durable goods, chose a path of "responsible growth," staying true to its heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

Jean-Louis Dumas, the fifth-generation CEO, revitalized the brand by making it relevant to a new generation without compromising its roots. He launched an ad campaign featuring young Parisian women wearing Hermès scarves with jeans, a stark contrast to the brand's traditional clientele like Queen Elizabeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. This "not your mother's Tiffany" approach, without explicitly stating it, allowed Hermès to coexist with fashion trends while maintaining its classic identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>.

### "Quiet Luxury"
Hermès is a pioneer of "quiet luxury," where products are handcrafted with the highest quality, and the brand is not overtly pushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:04">[04:58:04]</a>. The focus is on craftsmanship and the intrinsic value of the item, rather than loud logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:20">[03:36:20]</a>. While the brand has since incorporated more visible iconography (like the "H" on belts), it remains less flashy than other luxury labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>.

### Resilient Business Model
Hermès is considered one of the most recession-insulated businesses, maintaining strong sales even during economic downturns like the Great Depression and the recent pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:41">[05:20:41]</a>. Their strategy of responsible growth, limiting production, and slower price appreciation contributes to the desirability and durability of their goods during market pullbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:44">[03:17:44]</a>.

## Global Expansion and Customer Base
Jean-Louis Dumas also drove the internationalization of Hermès, recognizing the expanding global wealthy elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. The brand strategically opened stores in travel destinations to cater to its clientele <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:02">[03:59:02]</a>. Today, Hermès' business is largely an Asia business, with 48% of sales coming from Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:54">[03:11:54]</a>. Japan, however, still buys twice as much Hermès per capita as China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:59">[03:12:59]</a>. Notably, 80% of Hermès clients in China are under 40 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Production and Craftsmanship
Hermès' dedication to craftsmanship is a core differentiator:
*   **Handmade Production**: Approximately 85% of their production is still done by hand by master craftspeople in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:01">[05:06:01]</a>.
*   **Saddle Stitch**: A key technique that provides superior durability and aesthetic appeal, often done by hand using two needles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:03">[02:23:03]</a>.
*   **One Craftsman, One Bag**: A Kelly bag is made by a single craftsman, taking about 20 hours over a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.
*   **Savoi-faire**: The company emphasizes the transmission of expertise and technique from one craftsperson to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:44">[02:59:44]</a>.
*   **Scaling the "Old Way"**: The current generation of leadership has figured out how to scale handcrafted artisanal production by horizontally expanding their ateliers, ensuring no single workshop has more than 250-300 craftspeople to maintain a personal environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>. They also build their own training pipelines and trade schools in rural areas to develop new artisans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:23">[02:48:23]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Considerations
*   **External Consulting**: Hermès has a corporate policy of no consultants, stemming from a past recommendation to outsource production and lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.
*   **Product Diversification**: While known for leather goods, Hermès also sells ready-to-wear clothing, silk scarves, perfume, beauty products, and even furniture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:44">[03:01:44]</a>. The expansion into mass-market products like perfume sold in department stores and the Apple Watch partnership raises questions about brand dilution and adherence to their "pure" image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:05">[03:03:05]</a>.
*   **E-commerce and Airport Strategy**: Hermès' e-commerce strategy does not allow for Birkin or Kelly bag purchases online, but it caters to new buyers for more accessible items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:55">[03:38:55]</a>. Similarly, airport stores serve as approachable entry points for first-time buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:06">[03:40:06]</a>.
*   **Employee Retention**: Hermès boasts exceptionally low annual turnover (6%), with only 4.5% leaving voluntarily, far below industry averages for manufacturing and retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:53">[03:40:53]</a>. This high retention rate is crucial for preserving their unique craft knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:45">[03:42:45]</a>.

## [[Challenges in Developing Market Power | Bernard Arnault's Attempted Takeover]]
In 2010, [[Challenges in Developing Market Power | Bernard Arnault]] of LVMH, after quietly building a stake for nearly a decade using equity swaps, announced control of 14.2% of Hermès <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:37">[02:29:37]</a>. His strategy aimed to capitalize on perceived cracks in the business, including a non-family CEO transition and ventures into non-core areas like a canvas beach bag or a stake in Leica cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:57">[02:19:57]</a>.

The Hermès family, despite the temptation of immense liquidity, rallied to create a cooperative vehicle called H51, into which over 50 family members contributed 50.2% of the company's equity, contractually locking it up for at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:10">[02:34:10]</a>. This audacious defense prevented [[Challenges in Developing Market Power | Arnault]] from gaining control, demonstrating the family's deep commitment to preserving the brand's identity and heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a>. Although [[Challenges in Developing Market Power | Arnault]] ultimately profited immensely from the appreciation of Hermès shares and tax-free share swaps that increased his control of LVMH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:53">[02:41:53]</a>, the Hermès family maintained independence, solidifying their position as an "unassailable, exceptional business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:36">[02:42:36]</a>.

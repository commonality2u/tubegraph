[[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM Holdings]] is a company that develops the instruction set architecture (ISA) and many of the designs underpinning CPUs found in modern electronic devices, including phones, cars, televisions, thermostats, and gaming consoles like the PS5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The CPU, or digital brain, runs all complex software, operating systems, and applications within these devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

[[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] licenses its ISA, allowing partners like [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | Apple]] to develop their own CPUs based on [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]]. Alternatively, [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] designs and licenses its own CPUs to companies such as [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | Samsung]], [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | MediaTek]], [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | Tesla]], [[Qualcomms history and evolution | Qualcomm]], and [[ARMs adoption in data centers and AI applications | Amazon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. By 2024, an estimated 29 billion [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] chips were shipped, equating to about four chips for every human on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Origins and RISC Architecture

[[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] originated over 30 years ago from Cambridge University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The company was publicly traded, taken private by SoftBank in 2016, and went public again in 2023, now valued at approximately $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Renee Haas, the current CEO, has been with [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] for 11 years, following a tenure as a VP at NVIDIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The development of [[comparison_between_risc_and_cisc_architectures | Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)]] architecture, upon which [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] is based, can be traced back to professors at the University of California, Berkeley, like David Patterson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This emerged as an alternative to [[comparison_between_risc_and_cisc_architectures | Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)]] architectures, such as x86 and Motorola 68000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

*   **[[comparison_between_risc_and_cisc_architectures | CISC]] processors**: Characterized by numerous complex instructions, often carrying "baggage" from older software. These instructions require multiple operations per clock cycle, consuming more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **[[comparison_between_risc_and_cisc_architectures | RISC]] processors**: Designed with simpler, more efficient instructions (e.g., add, subtract) that can be combined for greater efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This approach leads to lower power consumption and smaller memory footprints, which was beneficial when memory was expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Despite [[comparison_between_risc_and_cisc_architectures | RISC's]] advantages, [[comparison_between_risc_and_cisc_architectures | CISC]] continued to dominate the PC era. This was largely due to [[history_and_evolution_of_video_gaming | IBM's]] decision in 1981 to use [[Qualcomms history and evolution | Intel's]] x86 processor and DOS (later Windows) for its PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. This choice created a sticky platform with a vast amount of software written specifically for x86, making it difficult for alternative architectures to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Software compatibility and legacy are critical factors in the longevity of a CPU architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. A major paradigm shift in benefits (e.g., 10x advantage in power or cost) is typically required to justify a switch from an established architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

## Business Model and Market Penetration

[[ARMs business model and licensing strategy | ARM's business model]] was revolutionary for its time: instead of building and selling its own microprocessors, it opted for a licensing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. This involved a modest upfront licensing fee (a proxy for R&D costs) and a royalty on each chip shipped in production, based on a "shared success" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. This model benefited from the emerging ecosystem of design tools and methodologies (e.g., Synopsis, Cadence) that allowed integration of third-party designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

Initially, [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] faced challenges due to the absence of a software ecosystem that ran on its architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. However, its first significant design win was in the [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | Apple Newton]], chosen for its low power, performance, and cost characteristics, allowing the chip to run off a battery and be housed in a plastic package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

A major breakthrough occurred in the mid-1990s with the rise of mobile phones. [[Qualcomms history and evolution | Texas Instruments]] (TI), a major supplier of baseband chips for 2G and GSM phones, adopted [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] for a small microprocessor within their chips for [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | Nokia]] GSM phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. TI chose [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] because it was elegant, offered the right power and performance, and the value of TI's product was in the radio, not the processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. This established [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] as the de facto standard for handset chipsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

Subsequent milestones in [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM's]] journey included:
*   Running the Symbian operating system on GSM phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.
*   Being chosen as the engine inside the first [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | iPod]] in the early 2000s, which had a crude display and ran an operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   The pivotal adoption in the [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | iPhone]] (2007) and subsequently the [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | Android ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | Apple]] chose [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] over [[Qualcomms history and evolution | Intel's]] Atom processor (designed for netbooks), recognizing [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM's]] superior efficiency and power for a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. The iPhone decision established [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] as the standard for smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

## Dual Business Models and Software Compatibility

[[ARMs business model and licensing strategy | ARM's]] core business model revolves around licensing and royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. In the early days, licensing fees constituted the majority of revenue, as many companies licensed the architecture but did not ship significant volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.

[[ARMs business model and licensing strategy | ARM]] offers two main types of licenses:
1.  **Core (Implementation) License**: Customers license a pre-designed [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] CPU core, taking [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM's]] blueprint and integrating it into their chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
2.  **Architectural License**: This allows customers, like [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | Apple]], to design their own [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]]-compatible CPU implementations from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. A crucial aspect of this model is that licensees are **not** allowed to add custom instructions that would break [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]]'s instruction set architecture (ISA) compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. This ensures universal software compatibility across the [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] ecosystem, a major superpower of the architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. While historically, architectural licenses were more common, they are less so today due to the complexity and high cost of designing a CPU from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

The dominance of [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] and x86 today, despite a large graveyard of other capable CPUs like 68000, PowerPC, Spark, and MIPS, highlights the critical role of software compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>. Once a software flywheel is built on a specific architecture, it becomes immensely difficult for new hardware to succeed without that existing software story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. The shift of investment into software services and the decline in venture capital for semiconductor startups in the 2000s further solidified the position of the existing architectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.

## Modern Relevance: Data Centers and AI

[[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | ARM's]] relevance has expanded beyond mobile into areas like data centers and [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | AI applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The limited choices in the market (primarily x86 and [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]]) and the increasing importance of power efficiency in data centers have favored [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.

[[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM's]] open model allows its products to be built at any fab by any chip company, providing customers with more options compared to x86, which is primarily built by [[Qualcomms history and evolution | Intel]] (in-house and at TSMC) and AMD (at TSMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>. This flexibility is a significant advantage, especially for hyperscalers like [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | Microsoft]], [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | Google]], and [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | AWS]] who are developing custom chip efforts on [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. These companies can build custom Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) with tailored memory, storage, or interconnects, leading to significant Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) benefits and innovation that is not possible with the fixed x86 offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.

The rise of [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | AI]] has created an "unabated" need for compute innovation, with [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] positioned at the center of this growth, from data centers to automobiles, smartphones, and wearables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. While GPUs are crucial for [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | AI]] training, the majority of [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | AI]] workloads will involve inference, which is projected to run everywhere, including on smaller edge devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. These edge devices cannot accommodate high-power GPUs, necessitating CPUs for main system operation and increasingly for [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | AI]] acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] is addressing this by adding [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | AI]] acceleration capabilities to its CPUs (e.g., Ethos NPUs) and fostering customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

The failed acquisition attempt by NVIDIA in 2020 (for $40 billion) further underscored [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM's]] strategic importance to the industry, despite initial market skepticism about the valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. NVIDIA itself has adopted [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] as its default platform for automotive (NVIDIA Drive), robotics, and data center products (Grace Hopper, Grace Blackwell), recognizing the innovation degree [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] enables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

## Strategic Evolution: Compute Subsystems

[[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] is strategically evolving its offerings to include "subsystems," which are natural extensions of its IP business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. Beyond just CPUs, [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] develops GPUs, NPUs for [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | AI]], and complex interconnects like Coherent Mesh Networks (CMN) necessary for server chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>.

Subsystems involve taking these disparate "Lego blocks" of IP (CPUs, CMNs, controllers, memory interfaces), stitching them together, and verifying their functional correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>. This provides customers with a pre-integrated, verified "virtual chipset" solution that can significantly reduce engineering time (3-9 months) and accelerate time-to-market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | ARM]] can even guarantee performance characteristics (e.g., 4.4 GHz frequency output) when working with fabs like TSMC, [[ARMs role in mobile and smartphone markets | Samsung]], or [[Qualcomms history and evolution | Intel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. This approach allows customers to focus their engineering resources on unique, value-adding IP like ISPs, cameras, or [[ARMs adoption in data centers and ai applications | AI]] accelerators, rather than the core compute plumbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.

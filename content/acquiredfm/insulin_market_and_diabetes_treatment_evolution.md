From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The history of insulin treatment and the broader diabetes market is marked by scientific breakthroughs, fierce competition, and significant changes in healthcare economics. This narrative is closely tied to the story of [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]], a company that has been central to metabolic health for over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## The Discovery of Insulin

In 1921, the pancreatic hormone insulin was discovered and extracted by a laboratory group at the University of Toronto Medical School in Toronto, Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This group included physician Frederick Banting, medical student Charles Best, a chemist, the head of the laboratory, and assistant medical school dean John Macleod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

Insulin regulates glucose absorption into the blood and is a primary anabolic hormone in most animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Insufficient insulin production leads to diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### Pre-Insulin Diabetes Treatment

Before insulin, Type 1 diabetes (juvenile form) was a death sentence, with virtually no treatment available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. The common wisdom was a "starvation diet" of 200-500 calories per day, attempting to prolong life until a cure was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. This diet was globally accepted as the official treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:12]</a>.

### The Nobel Prize and Early Challenges

Banting and Macleod were awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for the discovery of insulin, though historical consensus suggests Banting and Best did most of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This discovery was considered one of the most important advances in modern medicine, occurring before widespread antibiotics or vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

Scientists knew since the 1800s that diabetes was caused by a malfunctioning hormone in the pancreas, but couldn't isolate it until Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Banting and Best extracted "insulin" from dog pancreases and successfully injected it into severely ill human patients, leading to "miraculous recoveries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. However, insulin was a treatment, not a cure; patients needed regular injections to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

At the time, there was an extreme culture at the University of Toronto against profiting from medical breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Mass production was impractical due to reliance on dog pancreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

## Eli Lilly's Role

The University of Toronto licensed production rights to Eli Lilly, a large American drug company, granting them a one-year exclusive development license to mass-produce insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Eli Lilly sourced pancreases from cows and pigs at slaughterhouses, a novel and challenging entrepreneurial endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. This moment "turbocharged" Eli Lilly, making them a leading [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharmaceutical company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. Eli Lilly had insulin available on the American market by 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>.

## The Founding of [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]

The 1923 Nobel Prize nomination for insulin was put forth by August Krogh, a 1920 Nobel laureate from Copenhagen, Denmark, who later founded [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>. Krogh's wife, Marie Krogh, a physician and the first woman in Denmark to earn a medical doctorate, was diagnosed with diabetes in 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>. This personal crisis led them to learn about insulin in Boston in 1922 and visit Macleod in Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>.

Upon returning to Copenhagen, Krogh and his wife, along with physician Hans Christian Hagedorn (Marie's doctor), began to extract insulin from cow and pig pancreases using the Toronto method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>. They partnered with August Kongsted, owner of the Lion Chemical Factory (LÃ¸vens Kemiske Fabrik), to scale production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>. By summer 1923, they successfully completed human trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:59:00">[27:59:00]</a>.

In 1924, Krogh, Hagedorn, and Kongsted established Nordisk Insulin, an independent institution to produce and distribute insulin in Scandinavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>. It was set up as an operating company 100% owned and controlled by a nonprofit foundation, with a dual mission:
1.  Produce and sell insulin at cost in Scandinavia to maximize public health benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[35:47:00]</a>.
2.  Export it elsewhere at market prices and use profits to fund further diabetes research and support patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>.
This [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | corporate structure]] remains largely in place today, with the foundation controlling 77% of [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s voting shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:57:00">[36:57:00]</a>. The [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] Foundation's endowment is worth $120 billion, making it the single largest charitable foundation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:40">[02:59:40]</a>.

### The Bitter Rivalry: Nordisk vs. Novo

Among Nordisk's first employees were brothers Harald and Thorvald Pedersen, engineers and tinkerers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:35:00">[37:35:00]</a>. Thorvald, a pharmacist and factory manager, clashed with Hagedorn and was fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>. In solidarity, Harald resigned, and because drugs could not be patented in Denmark, the brothers founded a new insulin company, Insulin Novo, "down the street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>.

For 65 years, these two companies, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo]] and [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Nordisk]], competed fiercely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:53:00">[40:53:00]</a>.

#### Early Innovations and Competition
*   **Novo's Liquid Insulin:** The Pedersen brothers quickly developed shelf-stable liquid insulin, more efficient to produce and sold at half the price of Nordisk's tablets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:23:00">[47:23:00]</a>.
*   **Nordisk's Protamine Insulin (NPH):** Nordisk countered with protamine insulin, or NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn), a longer-lasting form needing fewer daily injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>. They licensed it to other [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharma]] companies like Eli Lilly but refused Novo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:00]</a>.
*   **Novo's Workaround:** Novo worked around Nordisk's patents, creating an improved version of protamine insulin that they claimed didn't infringe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a>. This led to lawsuits, culminating in Nordisk winning a Danish Supreme Court case where Hagedorn represented himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:59:00">[50:59:00]</a>.

### World War II and Post-War Dynamics

World War II began shortly after the court case, and Denmark was invaded by the Nazis in April 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:29:00">[51:29:00]</a>. Danish insulin production continued unimpeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:41:00">[52:41:00]</a>.
*   **Nordisk's Setback:** Nordisk's international licensing revenue ceased due to blockades with Allied countries, effectively putting them in "hibernation mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51:00">[52:51:00]</a>.
*   **Novo's Expansion:** Insulin Novo became the official Nazi-sanctioned insulin provider for occupied Europe, massively expanding production and supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:42:00">[53:42:00]</a>. After the war, the Danish state required Novo and the Pedersen brothers to repay most wartime profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:46:00">[55:46:00]</a>.

Novo emerged from the war as a scaled [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharmaceutical company]] and the largest insulin producer in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>. They developed Lent insulin (Lente), a slower-acting, longer-lasting basal insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:30:00">[56:30:00]</a>. Eli Lilly licensed Lente from Novo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:13:00">[58:13:00]</a>. In the 1970s, Novo introduced MC insulin (non-immunogen monocomponent insulin), the first 100% pure, zero-antibody potential insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:50:00">[59:50:00]</a>.

[[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo]] diversified into the enzymes business (laundry detergent and industrial uses), which was capital-intensive and less profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. This business, now called [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novozymes]], was spun out in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>. In the 1970s, an enzyme market crash left Novo short on capital for insulin production upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

### The [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] Merger (1989)

In the early 1970s, Novo proposed a merger with the struggling Nordisk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. However, Nordisk's new CEO, Henry Brennum (from a lumber company), rejected the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Brennum convinced Nordisk's board to reinvest its capital reserves into production, hire a global sales force, and directly enter the American market, capitalizing on Novo's delayed transition to MC insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

Nordisk's sales compounded at 30% annually throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. By 1980, Nordisk was one-third the size of Novo's insulin business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. Novo conducted a small IPO on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in 1974 to raise capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. In 1980, Novo's global insulin sales were $100 million, and Nordisk's were $30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.

In January 1989, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] finally merged, with Novo holding a 62% majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>. The combined company had roughly $1 billion in insulin revenue and 50% global market share, with Eli Lilly at 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>. This merger was driven by the increasing importance of scale in [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharmaceutical]] R&D, trials, approval, and sales due to genetic engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.

The [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] management initially planned for a further merger or sale into a larger, diversified global [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharma]] conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>. However, negotiations failed, and the company continued to compound revenue and profit at over 20% annually through the 1990s and 2000s, driven by the expansion of the insulin market and the treatment of Type 2 diabetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>. By the end of 2003, annual revenue was over $4 billion, primarily from insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>.

In 2004, a proposed merger with the Swiss company Serono was blocked by the [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] Foundation board, who believed the company's growth made a merger unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. This decision was crucial for the company's future, as it allowed them to pursue [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 agonist]] research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a>.

## The Rise of Type 2 Diabetes and Genetic Engineering

The number of Type 2 diabetes patients quadrupled from 1980 to 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. Historically, Type 2 diabetes was called "non-insulin dependent" because there wasn't enough animal-sourced insulin to treat it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.

In 1980, Genentech and Eli Lilly partnered to revolutionize drug production with recombinant DNA and genetic engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. Their first genetically engineered drug was human insulin, chemically identical to what the body produces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. This was a manufacturing and scale advantage more than an efficacy advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.

This announcement triggered a "race for human insulin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. Novo attempted to chemically modify pig insulin to match human insulin, which was a "huge boondoggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. Genentech's IPO in late 1980, before its product launch, demonstrated the massive investor interest in biotech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. Novo leveraged this hype for a US IPO, raising $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. Nordisk, meanwhile, focused on scaling MC insulin production and building recombinant DNA capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. By 1984, Nordisk became the number three global insulin player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>.

### Insulin Pricing and the US Healthcare System

The insulin market became unattractive around 2018 due to price caps, the introduction of biosimilars (generics for live-cell-developed drugs), and the emergence of [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 agonists]] reducing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:31">[02:41:31]</a>. US officials alleged that [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] increased prices over 600% between 2001 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:37">[02:41:37]</a>.

The [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | US healthcare system]]'s complex value chain involves drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | insurance]] companies, and [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | PBMs]], now largely consolidated into three major players (Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, OptumRx), manage pharmacy benefits for most Americans and negotiate rebates with manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:24">[02:28:24]</a>. These rebates can account for up to 75% of a drug's sticker price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:32">[02:40:32]</a>.

A key issue in the [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | US healthcare system]] is the misalignment of incentives and time horizons: [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | insurance]] companies often only cover costs that pay back within the average 3.7-year job tenure of Americans in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:34">[02:28:34]</a>. This means long-term preventative treatments like weight loss drugs may not be covered, as future costs would fall on different insurers or Medicare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>. Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage for those over 65) is legally prohibited from paying for weight loss drugs, partly due to historical stigma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53">[02:30:53]</a>.

## [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 Agonists]] and the Obesity Market

The modern era of diabetes and weight loss treatment began with the work of Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, who joined [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo]] in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:43:57]</a>. In the mid-1990s, she began researching glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone that affects insulin production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The challenge was that natural GLP-1 only remains active for about five minutes before being metabolized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>.

Despite industry abandonment, Knudsen persisted and, by the mid-1990s, developed an analog called liraglutide, which included a fatty acid to prevent rapid breakdown, giving it a half-life of 13 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a>. Liraglutide could be a once-a-day drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:28">[01:50:28]</a>.

### The First [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1]] Drug: Byetta

The world's first [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 analog]] drug, Byetta (exenatide), came to market in 2005 for Type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>. It was developed by Eli Lilly, based on a hormone found in the venom of the Gila monster lizard, which two American VA hospital researchers discovered had GLP-1 analog properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:59">[01:51:59]</a>. Byetta required two injections per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.

### [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s Breakthroughs: Victoza, Saxenda, Ozempic, and Wegovy

*   **Victoza (Liraglutide):** In early 2010, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] received approval for Victoza, the diabetes version of liraglutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:05">[02:08:05]</a>. It was a massive hit, achieving over $1 billion in sales in its first full year (2011), making it a "Blockbuster drug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>. Many used it off-label for weight loss, as doctors can prescribe drugs for non-FDA-approved uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:53">[02:09:53]</a>.
*   **Saxenda (Liraglutide for weight loss):** Despite initial internal skepticism regarding the obesity market, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] submitted Saxenda (a higher-dose liraglutide) for weight loss approval in late 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>. Saxenda yielded an average of about 8% BMI reduction, just below the "magical" 10% threshold for perceived effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:03">[02:12:03]</a>.
*   **Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy):** In 2016, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] began Phase 3 trials for semaglutide, an improved [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 analog]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:53">[02:14:53]</a>. Semaglutide is much longer-lasting (once per week injection) and twice as effective for weight loss (15%+ BMI reduction) as liraglutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:34">[02:15:34]</a>.
    *   **Ozempic:** The diabetes marketing product for semaglutide, launched in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:16">[02:19:16]</a>. It did over $1 billion in revenue in its first year (2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:28">[02:19:28]</a>.
    *   **Wegovy:** The weight loss marketing product for semaglutide, approved in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Wegovy received the same number of prescriptions in its first month as Saxenda did in its entire lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:07">[02:21:07]</a>.

[[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 drugs]] work by signaling satiety to the brain and slowing digestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:46">[02:16:46]</a>. Side effects often include nausea, vomiting, and constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:41">[02:17:41]</a>. They generally require continued use, as discontinuing treatment often leads to weight regain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:38">[02:38:38]</a>.

The market for [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1s]] has been massive, with [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s market cap soaring to nearly half a trillion dollars by late 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:11">[02:22:11]</a>. [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 drugs]] now account for 69% of their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:31">[02:23:31]</a>.

### Competitors and Future Outlook

Eli Lilly now has its own [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 diabetes treatment]], Mounjaro (tirzepatide), which also acts as a GIP agonist, bundling two hormones for potentially greater effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:11">[02:35:11]</a>. Mounjaro was approved for diabetes in May 2022, and for weight loss (Zepbound) in November 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:49">[02:35:49]</a>.

The [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1]] market is expected to see continued product improvements and increased supply from multiple companies, creating a "new super cycle" in [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharma development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:13">[02:36:13]</a>. Semaglutide is being clinically trialed for other conditions, including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, and kidney disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:19">[02:26:19]</a>. This could make it a "miracle drug" for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:59">[02:26:59]</a>.

Despite high list prices in the US ($1,000-$1,300/month), actual patient costs are often around $300/month after [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | insurance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. However, accessibility issues remain due to cost and supply constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:50">[02:38:50]</a>. Non-adherence is also a significant issue, with up to 68% of patients rolling off after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:03">[02:39:03]</a>.

[[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s success highlights the power of long-term focus in [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharmaceutical innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:02">[03:06:02]</a>. The [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharma industry]] is a high-risk, high-return "venture business," where successful "Blockbuster" drugs subsidize numerous failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:46">[03:11:46]</a>.# The Evolution of Insulin Treatment and the Diabetes Market

The history of insulin treatment and the broader diabetes market is marked by scientific breakthroughs, fierce competition, and significant changes in healthcare economics. This narrative is closely tied to the story of [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]], a company that has been central to metabolic health for over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## The Discovery of Insulin

In 1921, the pancreatic hormone insulin was discovered and extracted by a laboratory group at the University of Toronto Medical School in Toronto, Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This group included physician Frederick Banting, medical student Charles Best, a chemist, the head of the laboratory, and assistant medical school dean John Macleod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

Insulin regulates glucose absorption into the blood and is a primary anabolic hormone in most animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Insufficient insulin production leads to diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### Pre-Insulin Diabetes Treatment

Before insulin, Type 1 diabetes (juvenile form) was a death sentence, with virtually no treatment available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. The common wisdom was a "starvation diet" of 200-500 calories per day, attempting to prolong life until a cure was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. This diet was globally accepted as the official treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:12]</a>.

### The Nobel Prize and Early Challenges

Banting and Macleod were awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for the discovery of insulin, though historical consensus suggests Banting and Best did most of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This discovery was considered one of the most important advances in modern medicine, occurring before widespread antibiotics or vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

Scientists knew since the 1800s that diabetes was caused by a malfunctioning hormone in the pancreas, but couldn't isolate it until Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Banting and Best extracted "insulin" from dog pancreases and successfully injected it into severely ill human patients, leading to "miraculous recoveries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. However, insulin was a treatment, not a cure; patients needed regular injections to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

At the time, there was an extreme culture at the University of Toronto against profiting from medical breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Mass production was impractical due to reliance on dog pancreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

## Eli Lilly's Role

The University of Toronto licensed production rights to Eli Lilly, a large American drug company, granting them a one-year exclusive development license to mass-produce insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Eli Lilly sourced pancreases from cows and pigs at slaughterhouses, a novel and challenging entrepreneurial endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. This moment "turbocharged" Eli Lilly, making them a leading [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharmaceutical company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. Eli Lilly had insulin available on the American market by 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>.

## The Founding of [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]

The 1923 Nobel Prize nomination for insulin was put forth by August Krogh, a 1920 Nobel laureate from Copenhagen, Denmark, who later founded [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>. Krogh's wife, Marie Krogh, a physician and the first woman in Denmark to earn a medical doctorate, was diagnosed with diabetes in 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>. This personal crisis led them to learn about insulin in Boston in 1922 and visit Macleod in Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>.

Upon returning to Copenhagen, Krogh and his wife, along with physician Hans Christian Hagedorn (Marie's doctor), began to extract insulin from cow and pig pancreases using the Toronto method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>. They partnered with August Kongsted, owner of the Lion Chemical Factory (LÃ¸vens Kemiske Fabrik), to scale production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[02:07:48]</a>. By summer 1923, they successfully completed human trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:59">[02:27:59]</a>.

In 1924, Krogh, Hagedorn, and Kongsted established Nordisk Insulin, an independent institution to produce and distribute insulin in Scandinavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>. It was set up as an operating company 100% owned and controlled by a nonprofit foundation, with a dual mission:
1.  Produce and sell insulin at cost in Scandinavia to maximize public health benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[35:47:00]</a>.
2.  Export it elsewhere at market prices and use profits to fund further diabetes research and support patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>.
This [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | corporate structure]] remains largely in place today, with the foundation controlling 77% of [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s voting shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:57:00">[36:57:00]</a>. The [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] Foundation's endowment is worth $120 billion, making it the single largest charitable foundation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:40">[02:59:40]</a>.

### The Bitter Rivalry: Nordisk vs. Novo

Among Nordisk's first employees were brothers Harald and Thorvald Pedersen, engineers and tinkerers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:35:00">[37:35:00]</a>. Thorvald, a pharmacist and factory manager, clashed with Hagedorn and was fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>. In solidarity, Harald resigned, and because drugs could not be patented in Denmark, the brothers founded a new insulin company, Insulin Novo, "down the street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>.

For 65 years, these two companies, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo]] and [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Nordisk]], competed fiercely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:53:00">[40:53:00]</a>.

#### Early Innovations and Competition
*   **Novo's Liquid Insulin:** The Pedersen brothers quickly developed shelf-stable liquid insulin, more efficient to produce and sold at half the price of Nordisk's tablets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:23:00">[47:23:00]</a>.
*   **Nordisk's Protamine Insulin (NPH):** Nordisk countered with protamine insulin, or NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn), a longer-lasting form needing fewer daily injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>. They licensed it to other [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharma]] companies like Eli Lilly but refused Novo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:00]</a>.
*   **Novo's Workaround:** Novo worked around Nordisk's patents, creating an improved version of protamine insulin that they claimed didn't infringe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a>. This led to lawsuits, culminating in Nordisk winning a Danish Supreme Court case where Hagedorn represented himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:59:00">[50:59:00]</a>.

### World War II and Post-War Dynamics

World War II began shortly after the court case, and Denmark was invaded by the Nazis in April 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:29:00">[51:29:00]</a>. Danish insulin production continued unimpeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:41:00">[52:41:00]</a>.
*   **Nordisk's Setback:** Nordisk's international licensing revenue ceased due to blockades with Allied countries, effectively putting them in "hibernation mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51:00">[52:51:00]</a>.
*   **Novo's Expansion:** Insulin Novo became the official Nazi-sanctioned insulin provider for occupied Europe, massively expanding production and supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:42:00">[53:42:00]</a>. After the war, the Danish state required Novo and the Pedersen brothers to repay most wartime profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:46:00">[55:46:00]</a>.

Novo emerged from the war as a scaled [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharmaceutical company]] and the largest insulin producer in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>. They developed Lent insulin (Lente), a slower-acting, longer-lasting basal insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:30:00">[56:30:00]</a>. Eli Lilly licensed Lente from Novo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:13:00">[58:13:00]</a>. In the 1970s, Novo introduced MC insulin (non-immunogen monocomponent insulin), the first 100% pure, zero-antibody potential insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:50:00">[59:50:00]</a>.

[[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo]] diversified into the enzymes business (laundry detergent and industrial uses), which was capital-intensive and less profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. This business, now called [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novozymes]], was spun out in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>. In the 1970s, an enzyme market crash left Novo short on capital for insulin production upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

### The [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] Merger (1989)

In the early 1970s, Novo proposed a merger with the struggling Nordisk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. However, Nordisk's new CEO, Henry Brennum (from a lumber company), rejected the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Brennum convinced Nordisk's board to reinvest its capital reserves into production, hire a global sales force, and directly enter the American market, capitalizing on Novo's delayed transition to MC insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

Nordisk's sales compounded at 30% annually throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. By 1980, Nordisk was one-third the size of Novo's insulin business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. Novo conducted a small IPO on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in 1974 to raise capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. In 1980, Novo's global insulin sales were $100 million, and Nordisk's were $30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.

In January 1989, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] finally merged, with Novo holding a 62% majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>. The combined company had roughly $1 billion in insulin revenue and 50% global market share, with Eli Lilly at 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>. This merger was driven by the increasing importance of scale in [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharmaceutical]] R&D, trials, approval, and sales due to genetic engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.

The [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] management initially planned for a further merger or sale into a larger, diversified global [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharma]] conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>. However, negotiations failed, and the company continued to compound revenue and profit at over 20% annually through the 1990s and 2000s, driven by the expansion of the insulin market and the treatment of Type 2 diabetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>. By the end of 2003, annual revenue was over $4 billion, primarily from insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>.

In 2004, a proposed merger with the Swiss company Serono was blocked by the [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] Foundation board, who believed the company's growth made a merger unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. This decision was crucial for the company's future, as it allowed them to pursue [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 agonist]] research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a>.

## The Rise of Type 2 Diabetes and Genetic Engineering

The number of Type 2 diabetes patients quadrupled from 1980 to 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. Historically, Type 2 diabetes was called "non-insulin dependent" because there wasn't enough animal-sourced insulin to treat it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.

In 1980, Genentech and Eli Lilly partnered to revolutionize drug production with recombinant DNA and genetic engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. Their first genetically engineered drug was human insulin, chemically identical to what the body produces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. This was a manufacturing and scale advantage more than an efficacy advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.

This announcement triggered a "race for human insulin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. Novo attempted to chemically modify pig insulin to match human insulin, which was a "huge boondoggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. Genentech's IPO in late 1980, before its product launch, demonstrated the massive investor interest in biotech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. Novo leveraged this hype for a US IPO, raising $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. Nordisk, meanwhile, focused on scaling MC insulin production and building recombinant DNA capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. By 1984, Nordisk became the number three global insulin player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>.

### Insulin Pricing and the US Healthcare System

The insulin market became unattractive around 2018 due to price caps, the introduction of biosimilars (generics for live-cell-developed drugs), and the emergence of [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 agonists]] reducing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:31">[02:41:31]</a>. US officials alleged that [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] increased prices over 600% between 2001 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:37">[02:41:37]</a>.

The [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | US healthcare system]]'s complex value chain involves drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | insurance]] companies, and [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | PBMs]], now largely consolidated into three major players (Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, OptumRx), manage pharmacy benefits for most Americans and negotiate rebates with manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:24">[02:28:24]</a>. These rebates can account for up to 75% of a drug's sticker price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:32">[02:40:32]</a>.

A key issue in the [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | US healthcare system]] is the misalignment of incentives and time horizons: [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | insurance]] companies often only cover costs that pay back within the average 3.7-year job tenure of Americans in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:34">[02:28:34]</a>. This means long-term preventative treatments like weight loss drugs may not be covered, as future costs would fall on different insurers or Medicare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>. Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage for those over 65) is legally prohibited from paying for weight loss drugs, partly due to historical stigma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53">[02:30:53]</a>.

## [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 Agonists]] and the Obesity Market

The modern era of diabetes and weight loss treatment began with the work of Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, who joined [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo]] in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:43:57]</a>. In the mid-1990s, she began researching glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone that affects insulin production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The challenge was that natural GLP-1 only remains active for about five minutes before being metabolized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>.

Despite industry abandonment, Knudsen persisted and, by the mid-1990s, developed an analog called liraglutide, which included a fatty acid to prevent rapid breakdown, giving it a half-life of 13 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a>. Liraglutide could be a once-a-day drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:28">[01:50:28]</a>.

### The First [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1]] Drug: Byetta

The world's first [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 analog]] drug, Byetta (exenatide), came to market in 2005 for Type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>. It was developed by Eli Lilly, based on a hormone found in the venom of the Gila monster lizard, which two American VA hospital researchers discovered had GLP-1 analog properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:59">[01:51:59]</a>. Byetta required two injections per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.

### [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s Breakthroughs: Victoza, Saxenda, Ozempic, and Wegovy

*   **Victoza (Liraglutide):** In early 2010, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] received approval for Victoza, the diabetes version of liraglutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:05">[02:08:05]</a>. It was a massive hit, achieving over $1 billion in sales in its first full year (2011), making it a "Blockbuster drug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>. Many used it off-label for weight loss, as doctors can prescribe drugs for non-FDA-approved uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:53">[02:09:53]</a>.
*   **Saxenda (Liraglutide for weight loss):** Despite initial internal skepticism regarding the obesity market, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] submitted Saxenda (a higher-dose liraglutide) for weight loss approval in late 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>. Saxenda yielded an average of about 8% BMI reduction, just below the "magical" 10% threshold for perceived effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:03">[02:12:03]</a>.
*   **Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy):** In 2016, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] began Phase 3 trials for semaglutide, an improved [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 analog]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:53">[02:14:53]</a>. Semaglutide is much longer-lasting (once per week injection) and twice as effective for weight loss (15%+ BMI reduction) as liraglutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:34">[02:15:34]</a>.
    *   **Ozempic:** The diabetes marketing product for semaglutide, launched in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:16">[02:19:16]</a>. It did over $1 billion in revenue in its first year (2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:28">[02:19:28]</a>.
    *   **Wegovy:** The weight loss marketing product for semaglutide, approved in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Wegovy received the same number of prescriptions in its first month as Saxenda did in its entire lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:07">[02:21:07]</a>.

[[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 drugs]] work by signaling satiety to the brain and slowing digestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:46">[02:16:46]</a>. Side effects often include nausea, vomiting, and constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:41">[02:17:41]</a>. They generally require continued use, as discontinuing treatment often leads to weight regain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:38">[02:38:38]</a>.

The market for [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1s]] has been massive, with [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s market cap soaring to nearly half a trillion dollars by late 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:11">[02:22:11]</a>. [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 drugs]] now account for 69% of their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:31">[02:23:31]</a>.

### Competitors and Future Outlook

Eli Lilly now has its own [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1 diabetes treatment]], Mounjaro (tirzepatide), which also acts as a GIP agonist, bundling two hormones for potentially greater effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:11">[02:35:11]</a>. Mounjaro was approved for diabetes in May 2022, and for weight loss (Zepbound) in November 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:49">[02:35:49]</a>.

The [[glp1_agonists_and_weight_loss_drug_development | GLP-1]] market is expected to see continued product improvements and increased supply from multiple companies, creating a "new super cycle" in [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharma development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:13">[02:36:13]</a>. Semaglutide is being clinically trialed for other conditions, including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, and kidney disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:19">[02:26:19]</a>. This could make it a "miracle drug" for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:59">[02:26:59]</a>.

Despite high list prices in the US ($1,000-$1,300/month), actual patient costs are often around $300/month after [[economic_and_policy_dynamics_of_the_us_healthcare_system | insurance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. However, accessibility issues remain due to cost and supply constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:50">[02:38:50]</a>. Non-adherence is also a significant issue, with up to 68% of patients rolling off after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:03">[02:39:03]</a>.

[[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s success highlights the power of long-term focus in [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharmaceutical innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:02">[03:06:02]</a>. The [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | pharma industry]] is a high-risk, high-return "venture business," where successful "Blockbuster" drugs subsidize numerous failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:46">[03:11:46]</a>.

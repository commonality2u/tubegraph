Mars, Incorporated and Hershey are two of the largest confectionery companies in the world, with distinct histories, strategies, and market positions. While Hershey pioneered the American chocolate market, Mars' aggressive expansion, diversification, and innovative marketing led to its global dominance.

## Early Market Foundations

The early American candy market, around 1902, primarily consisted of unbranded "penny candy" like gumdrops and licorice, sold wholesale to local retailers and drugstores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Chocolate was not yet widespread in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

### Hershey's Pioneering Role
Milton Hershey began selling his Hershey's chocolate bars in Pennsylvania in 1900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. He discovered chocolate at the 1893 Colombian Exposition in Chicago and purchased chocolate-making equipment from a German company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Initially, solid chocolate bars were a new concept, as most chocolate was consumed as a drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

Hershey later learned about milk chocolate, invented by Nestle in Switzerland, and spent years experimenting to scale its production in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. This led to the distinctive, slightly sour taste of Hershey's chocolate that Americans became accustomed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. Hershey gained a significant first-to-market advantage, setting the taste standard for American chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

Hershey deliberately priced its bars at five cents to make them ubiquitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>, distributing them widely in stores, gas stations, and newsstands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. This strategy effectively invented the modern candy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. During World War I, Hershey supplied chocolate ration bars to the American military, hooking millions of soldiers on its product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. Hershey also became the "AWS of the chocolate business," supplying chocolate wholesale to other candy entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

### Frank Mars' Early Ventures
Frank Mars, the founder of Mars, had three failed candy businesses before establishing his fourth company in Minneapolis in 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. This time, he focused on chocolate. He introduced chocolate-coated buttercreams and then the "Marrow Bar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. His first major success came in 1924 with the Milky Way bar, inspired by his son, Forest Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>. Mars was among the first to produce candy bars mechanically in factory quantities, unlike many regional hand-making operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. By 1929, the Chicago factory was producing 20 million Milky Way bars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

## Expansion and Diversification

During the Great Depression, the candy business proved resilient, with Mars' revenue growing from $800,000 in 1924 to $25 million in 1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. Both Mars and Hershey focused on keeping prices low for wide accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>.

### Forest Mars' Independent Empire
Forest Mars, Frank's son, separated from his father in 1932, receiving $50,000 and the foreign rights to the Milky Way recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>. He moved to Europe to learn chocolate making from masters like Jean Tobler and Nestle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. In 1933, he opened a factory in England and launched the Mars bar, an adaptation of the Milky Way, which became the most popular candy bar in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. Initially, Mars UK used Cadbury for chocolate supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>. By 1939, Mars UK was the third-largest candy company in Britain, behind Cadbury and Rowntree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>.

Forest also began diversifying early on, acquiring a British pet food company, Chapel Brothers, in 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>. This was revolutionary, as specific pet food for pets was a new concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>. This pet food business quickly became profitable, generating cash flow to fund the expansion of Mars bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>.

### Return to America and M&M's
In 1939, Forest returned to the US and, unable to join his estranged father's company (now run by his stepmother), he formed a new joint venture, M&M Limited, with Bruce Murray, the son of Hershey's president, William Murray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:26">[01:57:26]</a>. This allowed Forest access to Hershey's chocolate and military sales channels. M&M's, inspired by candy-coated chocolates (dragees) he saw in Europe, were designed not to melt in hot weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>.

During World War II, M&M's were primarily sold to the US military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>, with Hershey being the exclusive chocolate supplier to the military, and M&M's receiving preferential supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01">[02:02:01]</a>. Forest also started another diversified venture, Uncle Ben's Rice (now Ben's Original), in 1942, which became the first branded rice product in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:19">[02:07:19]</a> and now generates over a billion dollars in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>.

## Marketing and Market Dominance

After World War II, M&M's consumer launch was initially tepid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:14">[02:09:14]</a>. However, after Forest bought out Bruce Murray in 1949 and gained 100% ownership, he hired an ad agency to conduct market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:53">[02:10:53]</a>. They discovered that M&M's appealed strongly to children, leading to the iconic slogan, "The milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:54">[02:15:54]</a>. This marketing directly appealed to parents' desire to avoid mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:09">[02:16:09]</a>. By 1956, M&M's became the biggest-selling candy in America, surpassing even the Hershey's bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:45">[02:17:45]</a>. M&M's also began printing the "M" on each candy in 1950 to combat copycats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:07">[02:18:07]</a>.

### Hershey's Advertising Aversion
Hershey, in contrast, had a strict policy of no advertising until 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>, and their growth target was simply 4% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:52">[02:13:52]</a>. This lack of marketing and responsiveness to the changing market, especially with the rise of television, put them at a disadvantage against Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:50">[02:20:50]</a>.

### Price Wars and Market Share Shift
Milton Hershey had intentionally kept his chocolate bar at five cents from 1900 until 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:21">[02:40:21]</a>. To manage inflation, they continuously shrunk the bar size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:06">[02:41:06]</a>. When Hershey finally raised the price to 10 cents in 1969, consumers were outraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:07">[02:43:07]</a>. Forest Mars capitalized on this by increasing advertising, increasing bar sizes, and maintaining prices, initiating a price and size war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a>.

In 1973, the combined Mars (including M&M's, Snickers, Milky Way, Three Musketeers) passed Hershey to become the number one candy company in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>. Mars' advantage lay in selling combination bars (with cheaper ingredients like nougat and peanuts) at a similar perceived value to Hershey's pure chocolate bars, leading to lower cost of goods sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:06">[02:46:06]</a>. Mars also developed a sophisticated commodities trading department, profiting from market swings that hurt competitors like Hershey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:03">[02:47:03]</a>.

## Modern Mars: A Diversified Conglomerate

Forest Mars retired in 1973, handing the $800 million annual revenue company to his three children, Forest Jr., John, and Jackie Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>. He later returned to start a luxury chocolate company, Ethel M Chocolates, named after his mother, specializing in liquor-filled chocolates, which Mars later acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

Under the second generation, Mars' revenue grew from $800 million to $20 billion by 2001, largely through globalization and acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:26">[02:55:26]</a>. They expanded into Japan, China, Russia, the Middle East, and South America, and unified brand names like Snickers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:42">[02:55:42]</a>.

Notable acquisitions include:
*   **Wrigley (2008):** Acquired for $23 billion with help from Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:05">[02:59:05]</a>. Wrigley's gum business was highly profitable, with high gross margins due to petroleum byproducts as a base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:08">[03:04:08]</a>.
*   **Pet Hospitals:** Acquired a significant stake in Banfield Pet Hospital in 2007, then fully acquired it in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:06">[03:05:06]</a>. In 2017, they acquired VCA, the largest independent vet hospital operator in America, for $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:04">[03:06:04]</a>. This expanded their pet care segment beyond pet food (e.g., Royal Canin, acquired in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:43">[03:06:43]</a>) into services.
*   **Kind Bar (2020):** Acquired for $5 billion, further diversifying their snack portfolio into healthier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:43">[03:09:43]</a>.
*   **Kellanova (pending acquisition):** In August, Mars announced an agreement to purchase Kellanova (Kellogg's snacks and international cereal business) for $35.9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:57">[03:10:57]</a>.

## Current Landscape

Mars' annual revenue reached $50 billion in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:33">[03:12:33]</a>. Their business segments are:
*   **Pet Care:** Dominant segment, accounting for 59% of revenue and nearly 100,000 of their 140,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:05">[03:14:05]</a>. Mars owns 3,000 vet locations in the US, about 8% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:16">[03:15:16]</a>.
*   **Snacking (Candy):** Accounts for $18 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:46">[03:14:46]</a>.

In the US confectionery market, Mars and Hershey each hold about 24% market share, with no other competitor coming close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:47">[03:15:47]</a>. Globally, the candy industry is more fragmented, with Mars as the largest at 11%, followed by Mondelez (7%), Ferrero, Hershey, and Nestle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>.



Its Legacy

The following article explores the history and impact of M&M's and its parent company, Mars, Incorporated, contrasting its strategies with those of its rival, Hershey, and other industry players.

### Introduction to a Sweet Empire

M&M's, now technically known as Milk Chocolate M&M's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, alongside Peanut M&M's, remain the primary sales drivers for Mars, Incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While M&M's come in numerous varieties, including Dark Chocolate, Pretzel, Almond, Crunchy Cookie, Caramel Cold Brew, and seasonal limited editions like Holiday Mint, Birthday Cake, and Pumpkin Spice Latte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, their core offerings drive the business. Mars, Incorporated, the parent company of M&M's, is a thrilling corporate story involving World War I and World War II, new technologies, inventions, serious family drama, and astute corporate strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The Mars family is exceptionally private and reclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Mars owns popular candies like Snickers, as well as significant pet food businesses, Ben's Original rice, and Kind bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Mars' revenue has surpassed The Coca-Cola Company, crossing $50 billion in sales in the last year, and it remains entirely privately owned by the Mars family, making it one of the top five largest private companies in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### The Dawn of American Chocolate: Hershey's Dominance

Before chocolate became widely available in America, the market was dominated by unbranded "penny candy" such as gumdrops and licorice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

#### Milton Hershey's Innovation
Milton Hershey began selling Hershey's chocolate bars in Pennsylvania in 1900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. His journey into chocolate began at the 1893 Colombian Exposition in Chicago, where he encountered solid chocolate for the first time in the German Pavilion. Smitten, he purchased all the chocolate-making equipment on display to establish his own operation in Lancaster, Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. At this time, solid chocolate was a relatively new concept, as most chocolate was consumed as a drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

Hershey later traveled to Europe to learn about milk chocolate, which had recently been invented by the Swiss company Nestle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. Though not a chemist, Hershey experimented for years to develop his own method for producing milk chocolate at scale, building a massive factory in what would become Hershey, Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. His process, while successful, inadvertently led to the distinct sour taste characteristic of Hershey's chocolate, which Americans came to associate with chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:18">[01:30:18]</a>.

Hershey's strategy focused on being first to market and setting the taste for chocolate in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>. He intentionally set the price of his chocolate bar at a nickel to ensure its ubiquity and pushed for widespread distribution through five-and-dime stores, grocery stores, and gas stations, effectively inventing the modern candy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a>.

#### Hershey as a Supplier
Hershey's extensive investment in production made it the sole large-scale chocolate production facility in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>. This positioned Hershey as the "AWS of the chocolate business," supplying chocolate to numerous other candy entrepreneurs who were creating "combination bars" (candy bars with other ingredients like nuts or nougat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>. During World War I, the American military sourced chocolate ration bars from Hershey, introducing millions of GIS to its distinct flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. This reliance on Hershey for chocolate supply would become a critical point in Mars' future.

### Frank Mars' Path to Success and Forest Mars' Ambition

Frank Clarence Mars, born in 1883, developed a passion for baking candy with his mother due to childhood polio, which kept him indoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. After several failed attempts at candy businesses, Frank Mars returned to Minneapolis in 1920 and launched his fourth candy company, this time focusing on chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.

#### The Birth of Iconic Bars
His breakthrough came with the introduction of the Milky Way bar in 1924, a product reportedly inspired by his estranged son, Forest Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This bar was a significant success, increasing the company's revenue from $73,000 to $793,000 in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. Mars was a pioneer in industrializing candy bar production, allowing them to produce at scale while many competitors were still hand-making products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

In 1930, Frank introduced the Snickers bar, named after his favorite horse, which would become the world's most popular chocolate bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>. This was followed by the Three Musketeers bar in 1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>. By this point, Mars had become Hershey's biggest customer for wholesale chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.

#### Diverging Ambitions
Despite the success, a fundamental difference in ambition emerged between Frank and his son, Forest. Frank was content with their wealth, enjoying luxuries like a horse ranch and a private airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>. Forest, however, had grander plans: "I want to conquer the whole goddamn world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>. This led to a dramatic split in 1932, with Forest leaving America to build his own empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

### Forest Mars' Global Empire and Return to America

With $50,000 and the foreign rights to the Milky Way recipe, Forest moved to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>. He spent a year working anonymously as a factory worker in Swiss chocolate factories like Jean Tobler and Nestle to master chocolate making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. His philosophy was clear: "If you want to get rich, you got to know how to make a product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>.

#### Building Mars UK and Diversification
In 1933, Forest established a small factory in Slough, England, and began making the Mars bar, a version of the Milky Way adapted for British tastes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. Initially, he sourced chocolate from Cadbury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>. By 1939, Mars UK was the third-largest candy company in Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>.

Forest also quickly diversified by acquiring Chapel Brothers, a small British company that made canned dog food, in 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>. This was a visionary move, as specific pet food was a novel concept at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>. This profitable pet food business generated cash flow to fund his confectionery expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>.

Forest Mars instilled a strong culture within his company, formalized into five core principles:
1.  **Quality:** Obsessed with quality from ingredients to packaging, Forest implemented a system where any employee could stop the production line due to a defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>. This wasn't just quality for its own sake, but "quality for money" – offering a higher quality product for a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.
2.  **Responsibility:** Forest was not a micromanager but empowered his employees. Mars paid its associates (as all employees are called) three to four times the normal salary for their jobs in early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>, with compensation tied to overall company performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:57">[01:32:57]</a>. Notably, a 10% bonus was contingent on not being late for the entire year, a rule that applied to everyone including the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:35">[01:33:35]</a>.
3.  **Mutuality:** Forest recognized the importance of the entire ecosystem, ensuring retailers, suppliers, and distributors all made money for long-term incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:59">[01:35:59]</a>.
4.  **Efficiency:** Inspired by business management literature, Forest focused on "Return on Total Assets" (ROTA), a metric of profit divided by the current replacement cost of fixed assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>. This pushed for high utilization of assets and a rapid payback period for investments, often targeting a four-year payback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. Mars' efficiency was exceptional, generating significantly more output per worker than competitors like Hershey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>.
5.  **Freedom:** This principle embodied Forest's desire for independence, leading to family ownership and maintaining private company status, avoiding debt and public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. Internally, this translated to a flat, open-office culture with no executive perks or private offices, a stark contrast to his father's lavish tastes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:59">[01:33:59]</a>.

#### M&M's and Post-War Marketing
In 1939, Forest returned to the US and formed M&M Limited, a joint venture with Bruce Murray, son of Hershey's president William Murray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:26">[01:57:26]</a>. This strategic partnership granted Mars access to Hershey's chocolate supply and military purchasing channels just as the US entered World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:14">[01:59:14]</a>. M&M's, with their candy shell, were ideal for military rations as they wouldn't melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>.

After the war, M&M's were relaunched to consumers. Initial sales were slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:14">[02:09:14]</a>. After gaining full control of M&M's in 1949, Forest commissioned a comprehensive market study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:53">[02:10:53]</a>. This groundbreaking research for the candy industry revealed that children loved M&M's, but parents were the buyers. This led to the iconic slogan: "The milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:54">[02:15:54]</a>. This addressed parents' desire to avoid messy chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:09">[02:16:09]</a>. M&M's also sponsored popular children's TV shows like *The Mickey Mouse Club* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:26">[02:17:26]</a>. By 1956, M&M's became the biggest-selling candy in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:45">[02:17:45]</a>.

#### Marketing vs. Product: M&M's vs. Hershey's
The rivalry between Mars and Hershey, particularly post-1960, became a story of marketing and distribution innovation. While Hershey maintained a policy of no advertising until 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>, Mars embraced television commercials and branding from the outset, launching animated M&M's characters in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:54">[02:18:54]</a>.

Hershey's prolonged adherence to its 5-cent price point for 70 years (until 1969), managed by continuously shrinking bar sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:21">[02:40:21]</a>, eventually backfired. When Hershey finally raised its price, Mars responded by increasing advertising and even increasing bar sizes while keeping prices stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a>. This aggressive strategy, combined with Mars' cost advantage from its combination bars and sophisticated commodity trading, allowed Mars to surpass Hershey as the number one candy company in America by 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>.

### Diversification and Global Leadership

Mars' current business model, under its third generation of family leadership, is a highly diversified conglomerate:
*   **Pet Care Dominance:** The largest segment of Mars, accounting for 59% of its $50 billion revenue and roughly 100,000 of its 140,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:05">[03:14:05]</a>. This includes pet food brands like Royal Canin and veterinary hospital chains like Banfield Pet Hospital and VCA, giving Mars a significant footprint in pet healthcare services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:06">[03:05:06]</a>.
*   **Snack and Confectionery:** Mars Snacking generates $18 billion in revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:46">[03:14:46]</a>. Its confectionery offerings now include Skittles, Twix, and Starburst, which were brought over from the UK market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>. Mars also acquired Kind bars in 2020 to expand its presence in healthier snacking options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:43">[03:09:43]</a>.
*   **Kellanova Acquisition (Pending):** Mars' planned $35.9 billion acquisition of Kellanova (Kellogg's snack and international cereal businesses) will further diversify its portfolio and bring it closer in scope to Nestle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:57">[03:10:57]</a>.

In the US, Mars and Hershey each hold about 24% of the candy and confections market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:47">[03:15:47]</a>. Globally, Mars is the largest candy company with 11% market share, but the industry remains fragmented, with many smaller regional players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>.

### Enduring Legacy and Future Challenges

Mars' success is attributed to its strong focus on scale economies, continuous marketing innovation, and strategic diversification into resilient industries like pet care. While Hershey remains a dominant player in the American chocolate market due to its legacy and brand recognition, Mars' aggressive, visionary approach has made it a much larger and more diversified global conglomerate.

The chocolate industry faces challenges from climate change, which impacts cacao tree cultivation and can alter the taste of chocolate due to genetic engineering for resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:11">[03:33:11]</a>. Mars, like other industry leaders, is focused on these existential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:35">[03:35:35]</a>. Despite growing health concerns about sugar consumption, candy sales remain at an all-time high, but Mars' diversification into products like Kind bars suggests an awareness of changing consumer trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:01">[03:31:01]</a>.

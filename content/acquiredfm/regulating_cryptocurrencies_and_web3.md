United States Congressman Anthony Gonzalez serves on the House Financial Services Committee, where he is actively involved in understanding and regulating [[web3_and_blockchain_integration_in_games | Web3]], crypto, and the broader economy, including topics like the Fed, GameStop, and Robinhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He is noted as one of the foremost members of Congress working on these issues, not just because he's played around with the technology himself, but also because he ran a venture-backed startup before his congressional service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Congressional Engagement with Crypto
Upon joining Congress in early 2019, crypto was already a topic of discussion, but it gained significant attention during the pandemic as markets experienced rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Congressman Gonzalez's deep dive into crypto began when listening to Kevin Rose's podcast *Modern Finance*, where an episode on Flamingo DAO served as his "aha moment" regarding the potential impact of this technology on society, capital markets, and access to financial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

To better understand [[development_and_impact_of_blockchain_technology | blockchain technology]], he spent months learning about different Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions, token differences, and application functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. Recognizing the need for practical experience, he used a small amount of personal funds to experiment with decentralized finance (DeFi) to understand its mechanics, later donating all proceeds to the United Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. This hands-on approach allowed him to legislate more thoughtfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

Currently, congressional understanding of crypto varies:
*   Approximately 90% of members do not understand it at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
*   Another 5% are on committees like Financial Services and are actively getting up to speed, understanding the basics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   The remaining 5% are members, like Congressman Gonzalez, who have extensively studied the space and are forming clear views on regulatory frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.

This specialization is common in Congress, where committees lead on complex issues and experts can guide broader understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. Initial support for crypto tended to be higher among Republicans, but the more significant divide is demographic, with younger members generally more engaged than senior members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. The President's working group paper on crypto, despite some disagreements, signaled the White House's recognition of its importance, jump-starting legislative efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>.

## Legislative Process and Challenges
The legislative process for crypto, like other issues, involves committees holding hearings, gathering information, and drafting bills. The goal is often to create "durable" legislation that is bipartisan and bicameral (supported by both the House and Senate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. However, the process is often frustrating and chaotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>.

A notable example of this chaotic process is the crypto provision included in the Infrastructure Bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>. This provision, intended to tax crypto transactions to help pay for infrastructure, initially risked defining any crypto developer as a "broker," which would have severely harmed the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>. The senator who proposed it later clarified that the intent was not to sweep up all developers but to target legitimate brokers for tax compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>. This incident highlighted the need for more thoughtful and incremental regulation in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.

## Regulatory Philosophy: "Do No Harm"
Congressman Gonzalez advocates for a regulatory philosophy similar to the "do no harm" approach taken by the Clinton administration regarding the early internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. This approach allowed the internet to develop before comprehensive regulations were imposed, preventing premature stifling of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. While acknowledging issues like tax evasion in crypto, he believes the response should not be to destroy the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.

The two main purposes of regulation in this space are:
1.  **Consumer Protection**: Safeguarding American consumers and investors from dramatic failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Comfort**: Providing clarity to developers so they can innovate without inadvertently breaking laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.

These two goals are heavily correlated, as most innovators aim to build transformative products responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. However, regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. has led companies like [[sam_bankmanfrieds_journey_in_the_crypto_world | FTX]] to operate outside the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>, which is detrimental to American job creation and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

## Focus on Stablecoins
Congressman Gonzalez predicts that stablecoins will be the first area of focused regulation, particularly following the Terra Luna crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. This event highlighted the distinction between algorithmic and fiat-backed stablecoins to members of Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

Future legislation will likely define "payment stablecoins" as fiat-backed, focusing on:
*   Reserve qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>
*   Auditing requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>
*   Attestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>
*   Consumer protection and redemption mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>

The aim is to ensure that if stablecoins are used for payments and people rely on them, they are solid and dependable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. This regulation is viewed as both consumer protection and pro-innovation, as it fosters trust in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. For algorithmic stablecoins, the approach is likely to remain silent for now due to their complexity and varied properties, adhering to the principle of not regulating what is not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

## Future Outlook for Crypto Regulation
While there is concern that the administration, particularly the SEC chair, may take a more heavy-handed approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>, the increasing bipartisan energy in Congress suggests a path towards thoughtful, bite-sized legislation. The goal is to avoid overreaching regulations that could cause more problems than they solve, emphasizing slow and considered action as understanding develops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. This careful approach aims to foster [[balancing_consumer_protection_and_innovation_in_us_technology_policy | balancing consumer protection and innovation in US technology policy]] within the rapidly evolving crypto and [[web3_and_blockchain_integration_in_games | Web3]] space.

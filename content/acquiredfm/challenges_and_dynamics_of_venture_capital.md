Charlie Munger holds a critical view on the current state and practices within the [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital]] industry, suggesting that its role in society is "very poorly done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:09">[02:51:09]</a>. He emphasizes the inherent difficulty of achieving consistent success in this field, noting it is "impossible to do Time After Time After Time in [[Venture Capital Dynamics | Venture Capital]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Issues within the Venture Capital Model

Munger points to several key challenges and negative dynamics in the [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital]] sphere:

*   **Gambling Mentality** In [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital]], deals can become "hot" and require quick decisions, leading participants to operate as if "just sort of gambling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:09">[02:51:09]</a>.
*   **[[Entrepreneur and Venture Capitalist Relationship | Strained Relationships]]** There is a prevalent issue where entrepreneurs and those doing the work often dislike their venture capitalists, feeling that the VCs are "only taking care of themselves" rather than acting as true partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Fee Structures** Munger criticizes the typical fund structures, such as charging "two points off the top plus the and that enables them to make very handsome loadings themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:16">[02:44:16]</a>. He believes charging extra points is unwarranted unless truly achieving "very unusual results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:46">[02:48:46]</a>, which is rare.
*   **Attraction of Wrong People** The ease of getting good results in theory, contrasted with the difficulty in practice, "attracts the wrong people" to [[Venture Capital Dynamics | investment capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:03">[02:51:03]</a>. Many who profit most act more like "investment bankers deciding which hot new area they're going to get in" rather than great investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:08">[02:51:08]</a>.

## Ideal Venture Capital Approach

Munger suggests that a legitimate [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital]] business should empower and nurture founders, helping them navigate challenges without excessive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:21">[02:52:21]</a>.

## Berkshire Hathaway's Contrasting Model

In contrast to typical [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital]] firms, Berkshire Hathaway operates with a reputation for "staying with things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. They rarely sell businesses, even if an investment banker offers a high price, unless it's a persistent problem business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. This "Buy and Hold" mentality aligns investors with managers, setting them apart from the standard practices of other firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:35">[02:35:35]</a>.

## The Investment Landscape

Munger believes that finding attractive investment opportunities has become increasingly difficult due to an abundance of capital and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:10">[02:11:10]</a>. He states that the "low hanging fruit" is "not gone but it's very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:49">[02:48:49]</a>. He attributes this to the natural outcome of human nature and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:27">[02:43:27]</a>, noting that "it was never easy... and it's harder now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>. This scarcity of opportunities could lead to an "unpleasant blow up of some kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:41">[02:47:41]</a>.

## Endowments and Capital Pools

Endowments and large capital pools are beginning to push back against high fees charged by [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital]] firms. They are negotiating terms, such as paying a standard fee on an initial amount but receiving no additional fees on subsequent investments, effectively reducing overall fees by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:25">[02:52:25]</a>. This trend is occurring "All Over America" as institutions feel "misled" and "irritated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:53">[02:53:53]</a>.

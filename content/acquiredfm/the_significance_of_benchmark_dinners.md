[[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark]] hosts unique dinners that serve as a cornerstone of their firm's culture, designed to foster curiosity, collective learning, and non-hierarchical communication.

## Origin of the Dinner Tradition

The tradition of dinners at [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark]] began with a desire to inject new practices and ideas into the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Inspired by Bill Gurley's reading of a Ben Franklin biography, which detailed Franklin's weekly dinners focused on diverse topics like finance, chemistry, and life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, the idea of hosting similar dinners for the firm emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This initiative highlights [[creating_new_firm_traditions_based_on_historical_figures | creating new firm traditions based on historical figures]].

An experimental dinner was held in late 2006 or 2007, which was Peter Fenton's first year at [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This initial event included the partners and four outside guests: Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The dinner was described as "amazing" and "electric," leading Bill to continue developing the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Philosophy and Purpose

The philosophy behind these dinners is rooted in the belief that firms are fundamentally a "collection of habits," drawing on the ideas of William James, who posited that humans are an amalgamation of their habits, which in turn sow character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark]], the dinners are a habit designed to nurture curiosity, considered the "essential lifeblood of the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Unlike typical Monday meetings, these dinners offer an "open-ended No Agenda wild explorations" into bizarre topics that partners might be curious about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. They honor the firm's core purpose of constant learning and activating collective curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, creating a "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved through one-on-one interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## The Unique Dining Table Design

A critical element of the dinner's success lies in the bespoke dining table, which addresses a key challenge in group dynamics:
*   Rectangular tables tend to embed power structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Circular tables can atomize the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Initially, the idea for an organic, expandable table that could deconstruct power centers and create a non-hierarchical, intimate construct was conceived by Jean-Marie Masoud, a French designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. However, the final design was executed by Ole Lundberg, based on a hand sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This unique table design has been so coveted that it has significantly improved Lundberg's lifestyle due to demand from other high-net-worth individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This highlights [[the_role_of_design_in_dinner_settings | the role of design in dinner settings]].

The table's structure inherently prevents sidebar conversations, ensuring that "it's all one conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This fosters a powerful "one conversation element" where everyone is "tuned in" to whatever is being discussed, whether good news, bad news, or tough news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional venture capital firm meetings where partners might pre-sell deals in side conversations before a formal meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. In fact, a rule at [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark]] was explicitly "no pre-selling a deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Esteemed Guests and Impact

The dinners frequently host highly esteemed guests, often individuals with whom [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark]] has not worked or invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Past guests include Dylan Field, Toby from Shopify, and even Jeff Bezos, though the table itself is not portable for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. These interactions provide "the spotlight of attention," which is considered a significant gift to the guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Encounters with individuals like Dylan Field leave the partners "swept off your feet," reinforcing their purpose to serve such people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

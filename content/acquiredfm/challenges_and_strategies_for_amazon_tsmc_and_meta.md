This article explores the strategic challenges and recommended paths forward for three major technology companies: Meta, TSMC, and Amazon.

## Meta
Meta (formerly Facebook) faces several strategic challenges but is also advised to double down on its core strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Challenges for Meta
*   **Apple's Policy Changes** The Apple changes were structurally devastating for Meta, leading to a significant haircut on its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Shifting Mindset** As a company that has always been growing, it is difficult for Meta to shift to a "scarcity mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Workforce Morale** The layoff of 11,000 people, while necessary, is destructive to company culture and morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Metaverse Strategy** The metaverse initiative is considered a "bad idea" because it consumes significant resources and attention from Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, and [[technological_innovation_and_challenges_at_meta | innovation]] in this area is not typically born from mass expenditures in large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Misaligned Core Business** Meta is fundamentally a services and social network company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Its metaverse strategy works against this, requiring the sale of headsets at scale and into friend networks for social interaction, which is a distant prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Current State and Strategies for Meta
*   **Resilience and Growth** Meta is doing "a fair number of things that they should" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Despite the Apple changes, these changes were "moat enhancing" in the long run for Meta's top-of-the-funnel advertising product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Meta has also effectively limited the TikTok threat, with TikTok's growth flattening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The network effects of Meta's products are underrated, and all its products are still growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Market Position** Meta remains a powerhouse in social media and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, and the money spent on the metaverse is not considered excessive given its quarterly profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Proposed Strategic Actions**
    *   **Acquire Shopify** A key recommendation is for Meta to acquire Shopify to "close the loop on e-commerce and advertising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, even if it means fighting the FTC in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   **Re-focus on Core Business** Meta should double down on its current strengths as a social media and advertising powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   **Abandon Metaverse** The metaverse strategy should be reconsidered as it is not strategically the best path for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## TSMC
[[tsmc_and_its_importance_in_global_supply_chains | TSMC]] operates in a complex environment, facing significant geopolitical and technological hurdles.

### Challenges for TSMC
*   **Geopolitical Risk** The primary long-term risk for [[tsmcs_geopolitical_and_technological_challenges | TSMC]] is geopolitical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Its core model of flexibility and adaptability relies on all its engineering being located in Taiwan, which carries inherent geological risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This "China risk" is largely unhedgeable from TSMC's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Technological Limits** Moore's Law is nearing its limits. EUV technology has another five to six years of advancement, but the path beyond that is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Competition** While currently blessed by the weakness of competitors, [[tsmc_pricing_strategy | TSMC's more aggressive pricing]] could open the door for competitors to undercut them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Strategies for TSMC
*   **Maintain Current Course** Overall, [[technological_and_business_strategies_of_tsmc | TSMC]] is advised to largely continue its current strategy, which "broadly makes sense" given the [[technological_and_geopolitical_issues_facing_tsmc_and_the_semiconductor_industry | complex political and technological situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Pricing Adjustments** TSMC has become more aggressive in raising prices recently, which is deemed reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Global Fab Expansion** Building fabs in the U.S. is largely for political reasons, and constructing facilities in Japan could secure a future ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Focus on Taiwan** Despite the geopolitical risk, TSMC should continue to "double down on Taiwan and roll the dice that nothing happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, as the China risk is not hedgeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Advanced Packaging** Investing heavily in advanced packaging, such as multiple chips on a triplet approach (like AMD), will be crucial as Moore's Law slows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Trailing Edge Fabs** The investment in 28-nanometer trailing edge fabs in Japan is noted, as China is making progress in this area where there's no economic reason for others to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Amazon
Amazon is described as a "Day Two" company, needing to embrace profitability and a more mature identity.

### Challenges for Amazon
*   **Over-Investment** Amazon dramatically over-invested in its logistics network, leading to a "disastrous last few years" with a completely out-of-control cost structure and over-hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This was partly due to trying to "be young forever" and reasserting control with initiatives like one-day delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **AWS Challenges**
    *   **Startup Funding Dry-up** The real dry-up in startup formation and easy money, much of which went to Amazon Web Services (AWS), poses a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
    *   **Microsoft Competition** Microsoft's strategy of bundling Azure credits with existing enterprise agreements allows it to "clean up" in the market for established companies that are slower to adopt cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
    *   **Feature Complexity** AWS has an "absolute absurd number of features" and a "pretty terrible" interface, making it similar to Microsoft Word in its complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Strategies for Amazon
*   **Embrace Maturity** Amazon should embrace its "Day Two" status, focusing on becoming a profitable company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This requires changes in how they organize, innovate, and choose markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The analogy of aging personally applies: trying to be a startup forever is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **AWS's Moat** AWS's extensive feature set acts as a moat, as every customer is dependent on at least one unique feature, creating lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **No Feature Deprecation** Unlike Amazon's retail side, AWS does not deprecate features. This commitment ensures customer trust in long-term enterprise value, even if a service becomes costly to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Leverage Seattle Culture** Amazon, like Microsoft, benefits from Seattle's "platform town" culture, which excels at building trusted foundations and backward compatibility, leading to customer lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This contrasts with Silicon Valley companies that are less trusted for long-term enterprise platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Strengthen Support** For AWS, building up support capabilities and rationalizing its offerings are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

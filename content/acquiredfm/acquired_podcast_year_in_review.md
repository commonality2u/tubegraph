Welcome to a special year-end episode of [[growth_and_evolution_of_the_acquired_podcast | Acquired]], the podcast that delves into the stories and playbooks behind great technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal recap 2022 for the show, the tech world, and themselves, while also looking ahead to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This episode offers a deeper, more "nerdy" dive, intended for established fans of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## 2022 Recap: Signature Episodes and Memories

Despite the broader craziness of 2022 in tech markets and the economy, it was a "pretty great year for the show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Key Episodes
*   **Taylor Swift**
    The year kicked off with the Taylor Swift episode in January 2022, which felt like "three years ago" due to the artist's continued impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The discussion highlighted Taylor Swift as perhaps the "first really really big internet Rockstar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, demonstrating how the internet enables much larger markets and demand even for niche products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The sheer demand for her concerts (900 stadiums worth for 50 shows) was unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, posing a challenge for ticketing and pricing without alienating fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This phenomenon underlines how the internet provides vastly more distribution and touchpoints for artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

*   **Sony**
    The Sony episode, initially not expected to be a "trademark Acquired episode," became one due to its captivating story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. It featured a genius founder, overcome immense adversity (Japan in 1945) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, and showcased a company with five diverse business units contributing double-digit percentages to both revenue and operating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. The discussion even went over two hours before mentioning PlayStation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

*   **Nvidia**
    The Nvidia episode provided insights into how the world works, particularly highlighting CEO Jensen Huang's three "bet the company" moments that paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. These included shipping a graphics card designed entirely in emulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>, a bet on programmable shaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, and a seven-year investment in AI and CUDA before the market was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. The hosts noted the accelerating developments in AI, exemplified by DALL-E 2 and ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, which further validated Nvidia's early bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

*   **Amazon (and Walmart)**
    The Amazon series, which included a foundational episode on Walmart, was the "biggest in Acquired history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. The Walmart episode helped listeners understand the concept of Discounters as the most common retail format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a> and recognized Walmart as a pioneering "applied technology company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. Walmart's use of technology, particularly in supply chain coordination, enabled lower costs and better profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

*   **Benchmark**
    The Benchmark episode, featuring interviews with the firm's partners, represented a "platonic ideal of an acquired" format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. This format, where the hosts tell the story and then interview the protagonists, leverages the show's unique position and deep preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

*   **Enron**
    The Enron episode was chosen to add unique value to ongoing conversations, particularly in light of the FTX scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Rather than real-time reporting, the hosts conducted extensive research to draw indirect parallels, allowing listeners to form their own conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. The hosts acknowledged their previous interview with Sam Bankman-Fried and expressed regret if it legitimized FTX for listeners, emphasizing their commitment to being "ridiculously selective" with guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

## [[podcasting_strategy_and_audience_engagement | Podcasting Strategy]] and Trade-offs

The [[growth_and_evolution_of_the_acquired_podcast | Acquired podcast]] has significantly evolved in its eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The hosts are intentional about their [[podcasting_strategy_and_audience_engagement | strategy]], which involves significant trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

*   **Core Principles**: The show is run by just two people, limiting content output to allow for "really really deep research" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. Episodes are intentionally long, catering to a dedicated audience even if it means less mass appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
*   **Avoiding a Network**: The hosts decline opportunities to expand into a podcast network or pursue book/Netflix deals, viewing these as a "lack of Purity" and "too hard" for their desired focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.
*   **Live Events**: While offering "special experiences," live shows are "way harder" to produce and result in a "worse product" for the vast majority of listeners after the fact due to sound quality and length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. The arena show, despite being amazing, was stressful and highlighted the compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. The goal is to be more intentional, perhaps doing one major live show annually and other in-person events purely for partner engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.
*   **Sponsor Relationships**: [[acquired_podcast_segments_and_community_engagement | Acquired]] focuses on season-long sponsorships with a highly selective group of partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. This deep engagement often leads to the hosts personally investing in sponsors, building "really real relationships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>. Five sponsors, including Vanta, Modern Treasury, Vouch, and Standard Metrics, have received investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. The sponsor segment for Brex highlighted their "two massive innovations" in corporate cards for startups and enterprise spend management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>.

## [[acquired_podcast_audience_growth_and_dynamics | Show Growth]]

[[acquired_podcast_audience_growth_and_dynamics | Acquired's audience]] has continued to double year-over-year for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>, reaching over 250,000 unique monthly active listeners by the end of 2022, up from 62,000 just two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.

*   **Growth Drivers**: The Amazon episode caused a significant "step change" in growth, bringing in many new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. Promotional efforts by platforms like Spotify also contributed, with 98% of Spotify listeners in 2022 not having listened the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   **[[podcasting_and_content_creation | Podcasting]] Challenges**: Growing a podcast is inherently difficult because the medium is "unshareable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>, unlike easily linkable written content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>. The show attempts to mitigate this by having a website for each episode with show notes and transcripts, which is the preferred sharing method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. The *Acquired* Slack community now boasts over 14,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>.
*   **Audience Quality**: A survey revealed the audience mix remained consistent, indicating that the show attracted "basically the same type of person" despite significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. The hosts believe they have the "most valuable audience in the world" in their niche, comprising CEOs, founders, engineers, and capital allocators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
*   **Revenue Model**: While audience growth is beneficial, the show's revenue is not solely tied to audience size but rather to deepening engagement with the "right people and the right sponsors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. Investing in sponsors, facilitated by the [[acquired_podcast_audience_growth_and_dynamics | audience's capital]], is a transformational aspect of the business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.

## [[acquired_show_format_and_upcoming_events | Looking Ahead to 2023]]

The hosts discussed potential topics and formats for the coming year.

### Episode and Topic Ideas
*   **OpenAI**: An "obvious" candidate, though they were "way too early" to cover it 12 months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>.
*   **Bernard Arnault / Luxury Brands**: Exploring brand power, houses of brands, and multi-generational success in luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>.
*   **Epic Healthcare**: Investigating whether it's a "hero's journey or an Enron" story, questioning if it captures more value than it creates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>.
*   **Acquired Sessions**: Evolving this format to feature fascinating people discussing topics beyond their direct work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>, or having guests as "props" to contribute to the hosts' discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.
*   **Other Companies**: Intuit, Nike (with an on-site visit to Oregon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:09">[01:25:09]</a>, and Sears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.
*   **Twitter**: The hosts deliberately avoided covering the recent Twitter drama, as it felt "less like a business story and more like a TMZ story," which is not their focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>.

## Personal Year in Review

    *   **Apple Watch Ultra**: Praised for its lightness despite its size, the bright display, and almost three-day battery life, which is crucial for sleep tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:56">[01:37:56]</a>.

He described the initial months as a "fog of War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:38">[01:47:38]</a>.

*   **Apple Devices**:
    *   **2020 M1 MacBook Air**: Still rocking this model, finding it sufficient due to its performance, battery life, and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>.
    *   **iPhone 12 Mini**: Currently uses this, but is conflicted about upgrading to the 14 Pro for its improved camera, which is important for a new parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>.

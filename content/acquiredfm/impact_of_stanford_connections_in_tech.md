The interconnectedness of [[Silicon Valley Venture Capital history | Silicon Valley]] and its [[lessons_from_the_history_of_technology_companies | tech companies]] is often underscored by strong academic ties, particularly from institutions like Stanford University. These connections can lead to significant investments and the formation of groundbreaking companies, illustrating the profound [[community_and_network_effects_at_y_combinator | network effects]] within the tech ecosystem.

## The Junglee Connection to Google

One notable example highlighting the impact of Stanford connections is the story of Junglee, a comparison shopping site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Junglee was founded by three Stanford Computer Science PhDs and a business professional from Netscape named Ram Sriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Amazon acquired Junglee for approximately $150-$175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. However, the acquisition was ill-conceived, and the Junglee team, unwilling to relocate from Palo Alto to Seattle due to tax nexus concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, ultimately quit within a few months and returned to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This same team later went on to start the entity that would become Walmart Labs, a major contributor to Walmart's e-commerce competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Ram Sriram and Google's Founding Investment

Upon returning to Palo Alto, Ram Sriram, leveraging his network likely through his former Stanford CS PhD co-founders, connected with two other Stanford Computer Science PhDs: Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Ram Sriram was impressed by their "BackRub PageRank" concept and decided to make the first investment in Google, contributing $250,000 and joining the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Jeff Bezos's Personal Investment

Approximately six months after Sriram's investment, Jeff Bezos, who maintained a friendly relationship with Ram Sriram despite the failed Junglee acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, learned about Google. Bezos, along with MacKenzie Bezos, flew to [[decentralization_of_silicon_valley | Silicon Valley]] to meet Page and Brin at Sriram's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Despite the seed round being closed and major [[insights_on_tech_investment_strategies and_decisions | venture capital]] firms like Kleiner and Sequoia circling for a Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, Bezos insisted on investing on the same terms as Sriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Through Ram Sriram's advocacy, Larry Page and Sergey Brin accepted an additional $250,000 personal investment from Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos at the initial seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Valuation at the time
> The subsequent Series A funding for Google, famously split between John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and Mike Moritz of Sequoia, valued Google at a $100 million post-money valuation, considered "insane for the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Mike Moritz famously commented at the time, "We've never paid so much for so little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Estimates suggest Ram Sriram's initial investment was at a post-money valuation of $10 million or even lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

It is estimated that Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos owned at least one percent of Google personally, even after dilution from the Series A, as Google went public solely on that Series A funding round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Google's IPO in 2004 had a market cap of $23 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, meaning their shares would have been worth approximately $230 million at IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Since then, Google's value has increased by 65x over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Jeff Bezos has never publicly commented on whether he and MacKenzie sold their Google shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, but it's understood they held them until at least the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This substantial personal wealth from Google provided Bezos with significant capital for other ventures, including investments in companies like Benchmark and Publicly Traded Startups (PSL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

This anecdote highlights how maintaining professional relationships, even after business dealings go awry, can lead to unforeseen and immensely profitable opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. It also exemplifies the critical role of university networks in fostering [[the_role_and_influence_of_major_tech_players | tech company]] growth and [[leadership_insights_in_tech_companies | leadership insights in tech companies]].

On December 1, 2020, Salesforce announced its acquisition of Slack for \$27.7 billion in a cash and stock deal [00:06:06]. This emergency podcast from Acquired, hosted by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, with special guest Packy McCormick of Not Boring, delves into the implications of this significant software acquisition [00:00:08].

## Background on Acquired Podcast
Acquired is a podcast focusing on great technology companies and their playbooks [00:00:10]. Ben Gilbert is the co-founder of Pioneer Square Labs, a startup studio and venture firm in Seattle [00:00:15]. David Rosenthal is an angel investor and independent advisor to startups based in San Francisco [00:00:21]. This special episode was recorded live, just two hours after the acquisition was announced [01:26:32].

## The Deal
The acquisition of Slack by Salesforce is valued at \$27.7 billion [00:06:04]. The deal is structured with a heavier lean towards stock than cash, roughly 57% stock [00:06:11]. This represents a 55% premium to Slack's trading price before the news leaked and an 85% premium to its stock price after earnings in September [00:06:23]. At the time of the announcement, the price per share was above Slack's first day of trading price [00:06:39].

Slack is expected to remain independent, with Stuart Butterfield staying on as CEO [00:07:10]. The deal is anticipated to close in 2021, subject to shareholder approval from Slack [00:07:16]. This acquisition marks the largest software deal since IBM bought Red Hat two years prior in 2018 [00:07:27]. It is seen as akin to Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn [00:08:00]. Salesforce had previously been a bidder for LinkedIn and had even filed an antitrust suit against Microsoft over that acquisition [00:08:40].

## Why Salesforce Acquired Slack

### Strategic Rationale
The acquisition is largely viewed as a [[the_art_of_selling_enterprise_software | distribution deal]] for Salesforce [00:26:46]. The aim is for Slack to leverage Salesforce's extensive sales force to penetrate larger organizations where it previously struggled to gain a foothold [01:00:56]. This move allows Salesforce to "arm the rebels" [02:00:51] by consolidating "best of breed" applications [02:14:09] to compete against Microsoft's integrated suite [02:11:00]. This is viewed as the "anti-Microsoft consolidation" [02:11:03] or an "alternative Microsoft alliance" [02:15:15].

### "Operating System for the New Way to Work"
Salesforce's press release stated that "combining Slack with Salesforce Customer 360 will be transformative for customers and the industry. The combination will create the operating system for the new way to work, uniquely enabling companies to grow and succeed in an all digital world" [02:44:42]. Slack is intended to be "deeply integrated into every Salesforce cloud as the new interface for Salesforce Customer 360" [02:50:01]. This suggests Slack could become an "on ramp" to the entire Salesforce ecosystem [02:59:02], potentially streamlining the historically complex Salesforce implementation process [02:54:02].

### Slack Connect
[[Slack Connect and external collaboration features | Slack Connect]], Slack's feature for external collaboration between companies, is a key strategic asset for Salesforce [02:12:12]. It grew significantly, from 380,000 Slack Connect endpoints to 520,000 in the last quarter alone [02:47:00]. This feature allows a company to communicate with various partners or clients in shared channels, potentially replacing email for external interactions and integrating directly into Salesforce products for lead management and client conversations [02:52:00]. This is viewed as a "work social network" [03:05:07].

## Why Slack Sold
Slack's decision to sell, despite being cash flow positive and having strong metrics, can be attributed to several factors:

### Market Perception and Stock Performance
Slack's stock suffered since its direct listing, remaining flat or down for 16-18 months and rarely trading above its direct public offering (DPO) price [00:04:13]. Wall Street consistently "hammered" Slack [00:41:44], leading to a "beaten down" stock price [00:42:06]. This underperformance is despite Slack being a top quartile SaaS company in most metrics [00:51:00], including being the fifth fastest-growing company and having the second-best net dollar retention among its peers [00:57:00].

### [[Comparison between Slack and Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Teams]] Threat and Competition
The primary reason for Slack's depressed valuation was the perceived threat of Microsoft Teams [01:04:49]. Microsoft aggressively targeted Slack by name, publishing charts showing Teams user growth surpassing Slack's, and leveraging its distribution power through Office 365 [01:07:08]. Microsoft saw Slack as a direct threat to Outlook and the broader Microsoft suite because Slack aims to replace email and become a central hub for best-in-class software integrations [01:10:01].

Microsoft Teams had approximately ten times the users of Slack (around 100 million vs. 12 million) [01:22:00]. However, this user count is inflated due to Microsoft's distribution strategy of pre-installing Teams or bundling it with Office 365, making it a "red herring" for direct comparison to Slack's deeply engaged user base [01:33:00]. Teams is often used more as a video conferencing tool, making it more of a Zoom competitor than a direct Slack competitor [01:15:00].

### Slowing Growth Rate
While Slack reported strong numbers in many areas, its year-over-year revenue growth rate slowed from 49% in the previous quarter to 39% [03:51:00]. This decline, despite tailwinds from remote work, could have signaled a need to find a strategic partner to boost growth and prevent further market skepticism [04:09:00].

### Fatigue and Leadership
The constant battle against Microsoft and the pressure from Wall Street may have led to fatigue within Slack's leadership [04:33:00]. While CEO Stewart Butterfield is a "product guy" with a strong vision [04:38:00], selling the business to Salesforce allows him to continue focusing on product development without the intense sales and market pressures of fighting Microsoft independently [04:54:00].

## Alternative Acquirers (What If)

### Google
Google was seen as a very strong strategic fit for Slack, given its Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) ecosystem [01:05:27]. Integrating Slack with Gmail, Google Sheets, Google Docs, and Looker could create a powerful "new wave office bundle" directly competing with Microsoft [01:06:01]. Google also has "literally an infinite amount of money" [01:09:37] and could have easily outbid Salesforce [01:09:48]. The strong existing integration between Google Docs and Slack, which involved custom work, highlighted a natural partnership [01:07:51]. It was surprising that Google's name did not appear in bidding discussions [01:07:06].

### Amazon
Amazon also had an existing partnership with Slack, powering its video product and using AWS infrastructure [01:06:54]. While a possibility, the fit was not discussed as deeply as Google's.

### Zoom
Zoom was considered a potential acquirer due to its high market valuation (around \$130 billion) [01:27:57], which could have provided "cheap currency" for an acquisition [01:58:00]. However, Zoom's focus has historically been solely on video [01:11:38], and its corporate development function was underdeveloped (a two-person team, only months old) [01:11:01], making such a large, complex deal unlikely without it being a direct "CEO pet project" [01:11:07].

## Bear Case for Slack (as independent company)
The primary "bear case" for Slack as an independent company was the rise of new workflow applications that embed chat and collaboration directly within them, such as Figma or Notion [01:48:00]. In this scenario, Slack could be relegated to a "backup" tool for emergencies or broad company announcements, losing its role as the central hub for daily work [01:49:00]. The emergence of tools like [[Comparison between Slack and Microsoft Teams | Discord]] also poses a threat, as they offer different user experiences and business models (e.g., paying for upgraded features rather than per user) that might be more appealing to the next generation of fast-growing companies and communities [01:49:00]. Slack's struggles with clear marketing positioning were also noted [03:37:00].

## Impact of the Acquisition (Future Outlook)

### [[Strategic implications for Salesforce and the broader SaaS market | Strategic implications for Salesforce and the broader SaaS market]]
The acquisition suggests a potential "rebundling" of enterprise software, moving away from the "best of breed" era where companies purchased many individual SaaS services [01:51:00]. Salesforce, as a large enterprise player, aims to alleviate "subscription fatigue" and procurement pain points by offering a more integrated solution [01:52:00]. This could position Salesforce to "run the Microsoft playbook" [01:57:00] by providing a comprehensive, integrated system, though the integration points might be different than traditional bundles [02:17:00].

### Growing by Acquisition
Salesforce has a history of "growing by acquisition," a strategy where a core business with moderate growth acquires high-growth assets to boost overall revenue [01:54:00]. Slack, as a large and still growing (albeit slowing) SaaS company, fits this mold [01:59:00]. The acquisition could be a way for Salesforce to meaningfully increase its enterprise revenue quarter over quarter by tapping into new revenue streams [01:04:37].

### Risks and Challenges
There are concerns that being owned by Salesforce could lead to product atrophy for Slack [02:23:00], as seen with previous Salesforce acquisitions like Quip or Heroku, which failed to achieve category leadership [02:27:00]. There's also a risk that the "stench" of being part of a large enterprise like Salesforce could deter innovative, fast-growing startups, causing them to move to newer collaboration tools like Discord [02:08:00]. Pushing Salesforce products onto Slack users through cross-selling is another potential pitfall [02:21:00].

Salesforce's position regarding antitrust scrutiny is also a factor; while not as scrutinized as Amazon or Google, this large acquisition could draw more attention [02:23:00].

## Grading Slack's Tenure as a Public Company
Slack's tenure as a public company is largely viewed as a **C-minus** [01:42:00]. While the final acquisition price is above its DPO, the stock largely remained flat or down, underperforming the market significantly [01:42:00]. This is largely attributed to a failure in communication regarding its strategic position against Microsoft Teams, allowing the narrative that Teams would destroy Slack to persist despite strong underlying business metrics [01:47:00]. However, on actual execution of its goals and product development, it would be graded higher (B/B+) [01:56:00], as much of its innovation (like the app ecosystem development) occurred "below the surface" and was not immediately visible to the public or reflected in the stock price [01:58:00].

## Future Scenarios within Salesforce

*   **A+ Scenario:** Salesforce successfully leverages its sales force to massively increase Slack's revenue growth, leading to more and more companies adopting it, including larger enterprises who now view Slack as a trustworthy vendor backed by Salesforce [02:53:00]. This acquisition catalyzes Salesforce's vision of an "anti-Microsoft alliance," becoming a successful new distribution channel for "best of breed" SaaS companies like Superhuman or Coda, opening new markets for them [02:59:00]. Slack Connect truly humanizes the sales process and builds strong network effects between companies [02:59:00].

*   **C Scenario:** Slack's performance remains average. It integrates somewhat with Salesforce, but the impact on growth is modest. It continues to be a good product, but doesn't break out into new market segments or significantly challenge Microsoft [01:23:46].

*   **F Scenario:** Salesforce fails to integrate Slack effectively, turning Slack into another atrophied product like Quip or Heroku [02:20:00]. The "stench" of being owned by Salesforce turns off startups and high-growth companies, causing them to migrate to new collaboration tools like Discord [02:08:00]. The strategic bet on a "best of breed alliance" proves incorrect, as large enterprises continue to buy individual SaaS services or prefer fully integrated solutions from Microsoft [02:18:00].

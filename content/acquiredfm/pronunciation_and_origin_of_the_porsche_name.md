The name "Porsche" is often mispronounced. While many English speakers say "Porsh," the correct pronunciation is "Porsch-uh" or "Porsch-uh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The family themselves pronounce it closer to "porsa" rather than "pora," reflecting its German origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. When spoken with a German accent, "Porsche" naturally sounds like "Porsche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Origin of the Company Name

The [[the_economic_and_strategic_maneuvers_of_porsche_and_vw | Porsche]] company's name derives directly from its founder, Ferdinand Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. In 1906, Ferdinand Porsche, an acclaimed automotive engineer in Austria, was recruited to be the chief engineer at Daimler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Although often referred to with the title "Dr. Ing. h.c. Ferdinand Porsche," Ferdinand Porsche never actually finished college; the "Doctor" title was an honorary degree received later in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

After two decades running engineering and car design for Daimler-Benz, Ferdinand Porsche left the company acrimoniously in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. In 1931, he established his own consulting firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. He named it "Dr. Ing. h.c. Ferdinand Porsche Konstruktionen und Beratungen für Motoren- und Fahrzeugbau" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This lengthy German name translates to "Doctor Engineer honoris causa Ferdinand Porsche Consulting and Design Services for Motor Vehicles company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This consulting firm marked the official beginning of [[the_economic_and_strategic_maneuvers_of_porsche_and_vw | Porsche the company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, and its full original name was still reflected in the company's stock name as late as 2008-2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

Ferdinand Porsche launched the company with financial backing from his son-in-law, Anton Piëch, and Adolf Rosenberger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Rosenberger, who was Jewish, was later arrested by the Gestapo and eventually forced to bribe his way out of prison and escape to America. During World War II, [[history_and_legacy_of_porsche_and_its_connection_to_nazi_germany | Porsche]] and the Nazis fully appropriated his stake in the company, effectively writing him out of its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

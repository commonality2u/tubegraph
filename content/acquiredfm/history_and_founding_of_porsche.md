Porsche, a prominent European luxury brand, has a complex history marked by engineering innovation, family drama, and significant corporate maneuvers. The name is pronounced "Por-sha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, as the family says, rather than "Porsh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, reflecting its German origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The company is renowned for balancing the creation of supercars with vehicles suitable for daily driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, differentiating it from brands like Ferrari or Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The average Porsche costs around $110,000, yet the company produces about 350,000 cars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## German Engineering and Early Automobile Pioneers

Germany boasts a long history of science and engineering, dating back to the Scientific Revolution with figures like Johannes Kepler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Before World War II, Germany produced more Nobel laureates in scientific fields than any other nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This tradition extended to the automotive industry, with Siegfried Marcus likely creating the first gas-powered vehicle in 1864 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. However, Marcus, being Jewish, had all records related to him destroyed by the Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Karl Benz created the first successful production consumer automobile, the Benz Patent Motorwagen, in 1885 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Around the same time, Gottlieb Daimler established his own motor company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, eventually producing the Mercedes model, named after a dealer's daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Benz and Daimler merged in 1924, forming Mercedes-Benz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Ferdinand Porsche's Tenure at Daimler and Vision for the "People's Car"

In 1906, Daimler recruited Ferdinand Porsche, then Austria's Automotive Engineer of the Year, to be their new chief engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Despite the honorary "Doctor Engineer" title he later received, Porsche never finished college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. He ran Daimler's engineering and car design for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. As World War II approached, Porsche conceived of a small, affordable car that could become Germany's first mass-market automobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. At the time, only 2% of Germans owned a car, compared to 30% of Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Daimler-Benz's board rejected his idea, leading to an acrimonious departure in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This marked the beginning of a long-standing rivalry between Mercedes-Benz and Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Founding of the Porsche Consulting Firm and Nazi Connections

In 1931, Ferdinand Porsche started a consulting firm to advise other car companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. He named it the Doctor Engineer honoris causa Ferdinand Porsche Consulting and Design Services for Motor Vehicles Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This firm became the genesis of the Porsche company as we know it today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Financial support came from his son-in-law, Anton Piëch, and Adolf Rosenberger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Rosenberger, who was Jewish, was later arrested by the Gestapo, imprisoned, and forced to bribe his way out of Germany, while Porsche and the Nazis appropriated his stake in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Ferdinand Porsche himself was a significant Nazi, a close personal associate of Adolf Hitler, and a member of the SS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### The [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] Beetle Contract

In 1934, Porsche's new company secured a monumental contract: to design Ferdinand's vision of a small, affordable car for the people—a [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This car would become the iconic [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] Beetle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The company that contracted Porsche was [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]], established by Adolf Hitler himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Hitler also created the city of Wolfsburg to house the [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The Beetle went on to become one of the most popular cars ever produced globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, with its original generation being the longest-produced single-generation model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## World War II and Post-War Transformations

During World War II, Porsche and [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] operations were repurposed for military vehicles, including tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Ferdinand Porsche designed the "Elephant" anti-tank tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. He also experimented with early hybrid and electric cars, but battery technology at the time was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. The war effort involved forced labor and concentration camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

After the war, Ferdinand Porsche and Anton Piëch were arrested by the French as war criminals and imprisoned for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>, primarily for forced labor practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Ferdinand's son, Ferry Porsche, was released after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

### The [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] Resurrection

Wolfsburg, where the [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] factory was located, fell under British control after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. The factory, being an orphaned organization, was initially planned for dismantling and shipment to Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. However, the British government deemed the Beetle commercially unviable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Major Ivan Hirst, a British officer, recognized the Beetle's potential and the need for West German economic revitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. He convinced British command to keep the factory in Wolfsburg and placed an initial order for 20,000 Beetles for the British military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. This "seed order" effectively restarted [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### The Rebirth of Porsche: The 356

Ferry Porsche and his sister Louise returned to their ancestral home in Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>, where Porsche engineers had been moved to avoid Allied bombings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Operating out of a sawmill in Gmünd, Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>, they initially fixed military vehicles, similar to Sony's origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

Ferry, who had a custom supercharged Beetle during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>, believed a small, powerful car was more enjoyable to drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. Using many Beetle parts and its rear-mounted, air-cooled engine architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, they created the legendary Porsche 356 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. While a Beetle might sell for $1,000-$5,000 today, a 356 regularly fetches $300,000, with special ones exceeding a million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. The 356 was a touchstone for the post-war sports car, valued for its agility over brute force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. Priced at $3,750 (about $42,000 today) in the late 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>, it found a surprising market in war-torn Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

### The Sweetheart Deal with [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]]

Upon their release, Ferdinand Porsche and Anton Piëch reunited with Ferry and Louise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]], now restarting, offered to deepen their [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. They proposed two key agreements:
1.  Reinstating the German Porsche company (Ferdinand's original consulting firm) to provide technical design and consulting to [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. In return, Porsche received a royalty on every Beetle sold worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.
2.  The Austrian Porsche company (Ferry's new venture) would become the exclusive distributor for [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] in Austria and other European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>, eventually growing into Europe's largest car dealer network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

This extraordinary deal, effectively a "license to create enterprise value," was driven by the West German government's need to rebuild its industrial base to counter the Soviet threat during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. High marginal tax rates (95% above a certain income) incentivized companies like Porsche to reinvest profits into R&D and production capabilities rather than distribute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

## Racing and Brand Building

Porsche heavily invested in racing, which, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, blurred the lines between enthusiast and professional markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. Unlike today's F1 cars, race cars were often modified versions of production vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. Famous Hollywood actors like James Dean and Steve McQueen were also professional race car drivers in this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. The Porsche 550 Spider, a dedicated racing vehicle also sold to consumers, gained notoriety when James Dean died in one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.

The 356 won its class at Le Mans in 1951 and 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. While Ferrari focused on racing and disdained road car customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>, Porsche prioritized road cars that could also be raced. Ferry Porsche famously stated that their cars could "go from an East African safari to Le Mans, then to the theater and then to the of New York" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. This versatility and usability became a core part of Porsche's brand, much like a [[Rolex brand history and its evolution | Rolex]] watch or a Rimowa suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>.

Porsche's success led to a surge in U.S. sales, with 588 cars sold in 1954, accounting for 40% of their total production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. This U.S. market share remained significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.

## The Birth of the 911

By the 1960s, with new competitors like the Ford Mustang and Jaguar E-Type emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>, Ferry Porsche decided to replace the 356 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. His son, Ferdinand "Butzi" Porsche, led the body design for a new, larger sedan project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. However, Ferry canceled the sedan, doubling down on sports cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>. Simultaneously, Ferdinand Piëch, Louise's son and Butzi's cousin, became a brilliant engine designer at Porsche, developing the six-cylinder boxer engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

Combining Butzi's styling with Piëch's engine, they created the Porsche 901 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. The name was changed to 911 because Peugeot held a trademark in France for any car model name with a zero in the middle (x0x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. The 911, first sold in 1964, became an immediate hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>. Its enduring iconic design, largely unchanged across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>, and its flat-six boxer engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>, solidified its status as a symbol of the sports car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>.

## Family Exodus and Management Turnover

In 1970, faced with escalating tensions between the two Ferdinand grandsons, Ferry and Louise made a radical decision: the families would completely exit operational management of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. They would retain ownership but no longer manage, operate, or design cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. Butzi Porsche went on to found Porsche Design, a separate company for branded merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>.

Ferdinand Piëch initially started his own engineering consulting firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a> but was soon recruited to run Audi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>, which at the time was a struggling brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>. Piëch revitalized Audi, transforming it into a major luxury competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>. His success led to his promotion to CEO of [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>. Under his leadership, [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] acquired brands like Lamborghini and Bugatti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>, and he oversaw the launch of the new Beetle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>. Piëch was widely recognized as the "Car Executive of the Century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>.

The first non-family CEO of Porsche, Ernst Fuhrmann, struggled. He scrapped the successful 914 (a joint project with [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]]) and introduced the 924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>, a front-engined, water-cooled car that, while good, did not feel like a true Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a>. Fuhrmann also intended to replace the 911 with the 928, a V8 front-engined car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>, reflecting broader industry trends in the 1970s towards larger, more comfortable vehicles amidst the oil crisis and new safety regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a>.

## Financial Turmoil and the 911's Rescue

The late 1980s and early 1990s brought severe challenges. Economic downturns and unfavorable exchange rates made Japanese sports cars like the Nissan 300ZX and Toyota Supra more competitive and affordable than Porsche's aging 928, 944, and 968 models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>. U.S. sales plummeted to 4,100 units in 1992, worse than 1965 sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:39">[01:40:39]</a>. Porsche's market cap fell to less than 400 million Euros, with zero debt, indicating the market believed it was worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>.

In 1988, the families fired Fuhrmann and appointed American CEO Peter Schutz. Schutz famously "saved" the 911 by extending its production timeline indefinitely on a whiteboard, boosting employee morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>. This story, confirmed by Schutz himself, became a legend within Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:16">[01:33:16]</a>. However, keeping multiple aging models in production stretched the company's resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a>. During this desperate period, Porsche even took on contract manufacturing for other brands, building the Mercedes-Benz 500E and the Audi RS2 station wagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:16">[01:42:16]</a>, which kept the lights on at the Zuffenhausen factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:37">[01:43:37]</a>.

## The Wiedeking Turnaround and Expansion

In 1993, Wendelin Wiedeking, who had protested the earlier management decisions, was recruited back to Porsche as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:25">[01:50:25]</a>. He implemented the Toyota Production System, bringing much-needed efficiency to Porsche's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. Wiedeking initially cut all product lines except the 911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>, famously stating, "Porsche's strategy for an entry-level Porsche is a used Porsche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.

His long-term vision was to expand Porsche's model line using a new strategy: instead of sharing platforms with [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]], new entry-level models would share components with the 911 itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">[01:52:52]</a>. This led to the creation of the Porsche Boxster in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:06">[01:55:06]</a>, a mid-engined roadster that shared the front end and interior of the next-generation 911 (the 996) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:08">[01:53:08]</a>. The Boxster was a huge success, genuinely perceived as a "freaking Porsche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:04">[01:54:04]</a>, and very profitable due to shared components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>.

Emboldened by this success, Wiedeking ventured into SUVs, launching the Cayenne in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. This move was initially met with skepticism and criticism for its design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:15">[01:57:15]</a>. However, the Cayenne was a first-mover in the luxury SUV market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:02">[01:58:02]</a>, shared its platform with [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]]'s Touareg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:58">[02:01:58]</a>, and provided immense profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:37">[02:01:37]</a>. Importantly, Porsche simultaneously launched the Carrera GT supercar, built in the same new Leipzig factory as the Cayenne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:15">[02:02:15]</a>. This strategy of introducing halo cars alongside new volume models helped maintain brand credibility and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

Under Wiedeking, Porsche went from a market cap of under 400 million Euros to 32 billion Euros by 2007, a 100x growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:23">[02:08:23]</a>, driven by strong operating profits from SUVs and sales growth in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:25">[02:10:25]</a>.

## The Attempted [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] Takeover and Its Reversal

With abundant cash and German tax laws incentivizing reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:27">[02:12:27]</a>, Wiedeking formulated an audacious plan: Porsche would acquire [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:06">[02:14:06]</a>. In September 2005, Porsche spent $4 billion to acquire 20% of [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] group shares on the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:42">[02:15:42]</a>. They continued to buy shares, primarily using derivatives and options contracts, to circumvent the "[[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] Law" which capped voting rights at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>. By 2007, Porsche had acquired over 50% of [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]]'s voting shares through a new holding company, Porsche SE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:36">[02:17:36]</a>.

Wiedeking loaded Porsche SE with $10 billion in cheap debt to fund these acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:10">[02:18:10]</a>. As Porsche bought up shares, the public float of [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] stock shrank, leading to a massive short squeeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:02">[02:19:02]</a>. In October 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] briefly became the most valuable company in the world by market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

However, the financial crisis trapped Porsche. They couldn't sell their highly-valued [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] shares to service the debt without crashing the price, nor could they take on more debt to reach the 75% threshold needed for full consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:34">[02:21:34]</a>. At this critical juncture, Ferdinand Piëch, still Chairman of the [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] board and a member of the Porsche supervisory board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:23">[02:14:23]</a>, publicly declared Porsche a non-viable entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:26">[02:22:26]</a>. [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]], under Piëch, offered to "bail out" Porsche by purchasing the Porsche operating company for €3-4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:02">[02:23:02]</a>.

## [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] Acquires Porsche and Modern Era

Wiedeking was forced out in January 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>. [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] acquired the Porsche operating company in two tranches, completing the purchase for approximately €8.5 billion by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:32">[02:24:32]</a>. The Piëch and Porsche families, through Porsche SE, emerged as the largest shareholders in [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] group, holding over 50% of the voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>. Thus, [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] acquired Porsche the company, but the Porsche/Piëch families gained control of the larger [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>.

Despite the financial crisis, Porsche's car sales remained resilient, with only one down year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:51">[02:26:51]</a>. Growth in China, where SUVs are particularly popular, contributed significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>. The 918 Spyder supercar, launched around 2013, introduced plug-in hybrid technology to the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:12">[02:27:12]</a>. Porsche continued to expand its model line with the compact SUV Macan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:42">[02:34:42]</a> and the all-electric Taycan sedan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:40">[02:35:40]</a>, which, despite being a sedan (a questionable choice for a first EV), drives like a Porsche and is well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:40">[02:36:40]</a>.

In September 2022, [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] re-IPOd Porsche, making it the largest European IPO of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:19">[02:40:19]</a>. Porsche's market cap surged to over $115 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:31">[02:40:31]</a>. However, Porsche remains deeply integrated with [[Volkswagen and Porsche Relationship | Volkswagen]] operationally, sharing platforms, components, and even a CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:49">[02:42:49]</a>.

## [[Legacy and Brand Power of Porsche | Legacy and Brand Power]]

Today, two-thirds of Porsche's over $40 billion in annual revenue comes from SUVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:27">[02:43:27]</a>. China is their largest market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:58">[02:43:58]</a>, primarily for four-door models due to a lack of sports car heritage in that region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:30">[02:44:30]</a>. Porsche delivers around 350,000 cars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:32">[02:45:32]</a>, making it a mass-manufactured luxury brand.

Porsche maintains strong brand power due to its [[Legacy and Brand Power of Porsche | heritage]] and the perception of "German engineering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:41">[02:56:41]</a>. Its gross margin of 29% is higher than BMW (17%) and Mercedes (23%) but lower than Ferrari (48%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:20">[02:51:20]</a>, which sells far fewer cars at a much higher average price ($330,000 vs. Porsche's $110,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:01">[02:48:01]</a>. Porsche's ability to produce high volumes while maintaining a prestigious image is unique, akin to Louis Vuitton's tiered access to luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:06">[02:46:06]</a>.

Porsche's long-term success is also rooted in its brand continuity, ensuring that those who admired the brand as children can still fulfill that dream as adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:45">[01:48:45]</a>. This fan service, combined with their history in racing and iconic advertising slogans like "Kills Bugs Fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>, has fostered an obsessive fan base. Porsche's brand is so powerful that even if the company were to face severe difficulties, its underlying value and potential for resurrection would remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:02">[03:13:02]</a>.

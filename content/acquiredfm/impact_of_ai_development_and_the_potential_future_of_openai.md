## Impact of AI Development and the Potential Future of OpenAI

The year 2022 saw significant advancements in [[Impact of artificial intelligence and open source on modern businesses | AI]] development, particularly with highly visible proof-of-concept models from OpenAI. These developments suggest a future where [[Impact of AI on business processes | AI]] could fundamentally alter how computers are used and integrated into various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

### The AI Renaissance

The current "[[Impact of artificial intelligence and open source on modern businesses | AI]] Renaissance" is marked by breakthroughs that have captivated the public imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Nvidia, for example, made a seven-year investment in [[Impact of artificial intelligence and open source on modern businesses | AI]] and CUDA before the market was fully realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. Early investors who believed in [[Impact of artificial intelligence and open source on modern businesses | AI]] as a "complete step change" for computers were ultimately proven correct very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.

Key proof-of-concept models that emerged in 2022 include:
*   **DALL-E 2**: While DALL-E 1 gained little acclaim, DALL-E 2 "lit the world on fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   **GPT-3**: This model showcased the potential for dynamic content generation, as demonstrated by a GPT-3-based feature that dynamically rewrote copy on customer websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT**: Released in late 2022, ChatGPT was considered the "most interesting" of these innovations due to its conversational, stateful interaction modality, allowing users to ask follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

These advancements represent a shift in how [[Impact of artificial intelligence and open source on modern businesses | AI]] models are interacted with, moving beyond stateless interactions to more conversational and persistent engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

### OpenAI's Impact and Future Outlook

[[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | OpenAI]] has been at the forefront of these developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. The company's innovations have led to a moment similar to the early days of cryptocurrency, where a new technology (e.g., a decentralized world computer) unlocks a vast array of possibilities, even if the specific applications are not yet fully clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

There is a strong interest in dedicating an episode to [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | OpenAI]] in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. It is acknowledged that covering [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | OpenAI]] too early, even a year ago, would have been premature as the full scope of its impact was not yet apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. The growth of these [[Impact of artificial intelligence and open source on modern businesses | AI]] technologies is so rapid that what is known one week can be different the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:19">[02:03:19]</a>.

[!NOTE|Unlocking Possibilities]
The current state of [[Impact of artificial intelligence and open source on modern businesses | AI]] with ChatGPT is described as "scary powerful," unlocking a "whole world of possibilities" similar to the launch of the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. While the immediate "Uber-level" business applications are not yet obvious, the foundational shift is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. This represents the "to-do list" version of what [[Impact of artificial intelligence and open source on modern businesses | AI]] can achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

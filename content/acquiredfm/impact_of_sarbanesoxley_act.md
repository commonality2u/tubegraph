The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was enacted on July 30, 2002, in response to major corporate accounting scandals, most notably the [[Enron financial scandal]] and Worldcom [01:00:00, 01:57:01, 02:38:02, 02:57:01, 03:19:55]. Its rapid passage through Congress was nearly unanimous, with the House approving it 423-3 (8 abstaining) and the Senate 99-1 [02:38:07].

## Key Provisions
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was designed to implement various measures to prevent future corporate frauds. Its provisions represent a "kitchen sink" approach, directly addressing the loopholes and misdeeds exposed by scandals like Enron [02:38:42]. Key aspects include:
*   **Top Management Certification**: The CEO and CFO are now required to certify the accuracy of financial information, introducing significant personal responsibility [02:39:00].
*   **Increased Penalties for Fraud**: SOX introduced more severe penalties for corporate fraud [02:39:05].
*   **Evidence Tampering**: New restrictions were placed on tampering with or destroying evidence, making it a felony [02:39:08]. This was directly influenced by events like Arthur Andersen's mass document shredding related to Enron [02:14:26, 02:16:03].
*   **Auditor Independence**: The Act mandated greater independence for outside auditors, requiring all accounting firms to spin off their consulting practices [02:39:13]. This aimed to eliminate conflicts of interest, such as those seen with [[Role of Arthur Andersen]] serving as both auditor and consultant for Enron [01:01:57].
*   **Enhanced Disclosures**: Public companies are now required to increase their disclosures, including revealing all off-balance sheet entities [02:39:23].

## Consequences and Effectiveness
The implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley significantly increased the cost and complexity of being a public company [02:39:59]. This led to a trend where companies opted to [[stay_private_longer | stay private longer]], especially in the early 2010s [02:38:33, 03:20:27]. This "stay private longer" phenomenon meant that while public markets might have become more protected from fraud, fraudulent activities could potentially shift to the private markets, as seen with companies like Theranos and many crypto ventures, including [[FTX financial scandal | FTX]] [02:51:50, 03:59:58].

Despite criticisms, it is argued that SOX has largely accomplished its primary goal: to protect the broader American public and investors in public companies from fraud [03:21:45].

## Other Notable Impacts
An interesting outcome of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is that one of its provisions – specifically, the prohibition against impeding an official proceeding – was cited in prosecuting individuals involved in the January 6th riots at the U.S. Capitol [02:40:07, 02:40:19].

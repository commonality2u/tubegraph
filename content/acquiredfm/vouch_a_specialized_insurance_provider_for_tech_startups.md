Vouch is an insurance company specifically designed for the technology industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>. It provides business insurance coverage for tech startups, protecting against risks such as litigation, theft, and cyber threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>.

## Founding and Connection to Y Combinator

Vouch was co-founded by Travis Hedge, an alum of Ohio State University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:42">[01:32:42]</a>. The company launched its first market on Demo Day, August 19th, after completing its Y Combinator (YC) batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>. Anu Hariharan, managing partner of YC's continuity fund, is an investor and board member of Vouch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>. Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, hosts of the "Acquired" podcast, are also [[experience_as_an_angel_investor | angel investors]] in Vouch and use the service for their own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:47">[01:23:47]</a>.

## Addressing Startup Needs

Traditional insurance processes for startups can be lengthy, often taking eight to twelve weeks through a broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. Vouch aims to streamline this, offering insurance in a matter of minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48">[01:25:48]</a>. Tech companies, like any other business, are susceptible to being sued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>.

As of May 4th, 2022, Vouch covers 32 states, which accounts for 97% of US [[venture_capital_and_early_tech_investments | venture activity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>. The company recently went live in Washington state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>.

## The Three Layers of Insurance

Travis Hedge describes the insurance business as having three layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:34">[01:26:34]</a>:

1.  **Distribution**: The process of selling insurance (e.g., brokers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>.
2.  **Underwriting**: The process of assessing risks and creating policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:43">[01:26:43]</a>.
3.  **Capacity**: The capital available to pay claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>.

Most insurance companies focus on one of these layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>. Vouch, however, initially began by getting licensed to sell insurance and then quickly moved to tackle the underwriting layer, creating policies specifically for technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>. They partnered with a major reinsurance company for capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.

### Vouch's Strategic Focus

Vouch's unique approach involved focusing narrowly on [[venture_capital_and_early_tech_investments | venture-backed technology companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>. This deep focus allowed them to become proficient at underwriting these specific companies, even if it meant saying no to many traditional businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>. This specialization enables Vouch to control decisions across the value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a> and to rapidly iterate on their products and services, such as offering unique coverages like "cap table coverage" and "cloud coverage" that were new to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.

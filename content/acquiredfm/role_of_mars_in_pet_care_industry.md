Mars Incorporated, widely known for its confectionery products, has a significant and long-standing presence in the global pet care industry, which has grown to become the dominant segment of its diverse portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:02">[03:14:02]</a>.

## Early Diversification
Mars's entry into the pet care market began very early in its history, under the leadership of Forrest Mars, Sr. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:52">[03:14:52]</a>. In 1934, just one year after establishing his candy business in England, Forrest Mars acquired Chapel Brothers, a small British company that produced "chappies brand canned dog food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>. At the time, feeding pets specialized pet food was a novel concept, as dogs and cats primarily consumed table scraps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>. This acquisition marked an early diversification strategy for Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>. The pet food business proved to be immediately profitable, generating enough cash flow to fund the expansion of Mars Bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>.

## Expansion and Key Acquisitions
Over the decades, Mars expanded its pet care operations, becoming a major player in the industry:
*   **North American Pet Food** In 1986, Mars acquired Kal Kan Foods in Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>. Kal Kan dog food was rebranded as Pedigree, and Kal Kan cat food became Whiskas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>.
*   **Royal Canin** In 2002, Mars acquired Royal Canin, a French pet food company specializing in prescription pet food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>. This strategic move capitalized on the growing trend of pets being treated as family members and the demand for specialized nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>.
*   **Veterinary Services** Recognizing the synergy between pet food and veterinary care, Mars began investing heavily in pet hospitals:
    *   In 2007, Mars took a large stake in Banfield Pet Hospital, the largest chain of pet hospitals in America, which originally partnered with PetSmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:08">[03:05:08]</a>. Mars fully acquired Banfield in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:08">[03:05:08]</a>.
    *   In 2017, Mars acquired VCA, the largest independent veterinary hospital operator in America, for $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:08">[03:06:08]</a>. Mars now owns 3,000 veterinary locations out of 35,000 to 40,000 vets in the U.S., making it one of the largest, if not the largest, player in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:16">[03:15:16]</a>. This expansion into services represents a diversification from its traditional manufacturing base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:28">[03:06:28]</a>.

## Current Dominance
Today, the pet care segment is the largest component of Mars's business:
*   **Revenue Contribution** As of 2023, Mars generated over $50 billion in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:33">[03:13:33]</a>. Mars Pet Care accounts for 59% of the company's total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:05">[03:14:05]</a>.
*   **Workforce** Of Mars's 140,000 employees, nearly 100,000 work in pet care, largely due to the service-based nature of pet hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:12">[03:14:12]</a>.
*   **Leadership** The CEO of Mars, appointed in 2022, came from their Pet Care Division, further highlighting the segment's importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:39">[03:14:39]</a>.

Indeed, Mars is arguably more of a pet food company that also makes candy, a strategy rooted in its very early days of diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:46">[03:14:46]</a>.

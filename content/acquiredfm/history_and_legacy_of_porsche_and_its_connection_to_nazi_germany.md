Porsche is a renowned automotive brand, known for balancing high-performance supercars with daily usability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. The average Porsche costs around $110,000, yet the company manages to sell about 350,000 units annually, maintaining its prestige and pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.

## Pronunciation and Origin of the Porsche Name
The correct pronunciation of the name is "PORSCH-uh," not "PORSCH" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, according to family members and those with a German accent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## German Engineering Tradition
Germany and Austria have a long and notable [[the_influence_of_porsches_brand_and_german_engineering | history of science and engineering]], dating back to the Scientific Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:59">[03:17:59]</a>. Before World War II, Germany produced more Nobel laureates in scientific fields than any other nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:30">[03:26:30]</a>. This tradition extends to the auto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

The first gas-powered vehicle, resembling a tricycle, was likely created by German inventor Siegfried Marcus in 1864 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. However, the Nazis later destroyed all records related to Marcus because he was Jewish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. The first successful production consumer automobile, the Benz Patent Motorwagen, was made in 1885 by Carl Benz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Around the same time, Gottlieb Daimler founded his own motor company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, and his popular model "Mercedes" was named after his dealer's daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Benz and Daimler merged in 1924 to form Mercedes-Benz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

### Ferdinand Porsche's Early Career and Nazi Affiliation
In 1906, Daimler recruited **Dr. Engineer honoris causa Ferdinand Porsche** as their chief engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. Despite the impressive title, Porsche never finished college; his doctorate was an honorary degree received later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

Ferdinand Porsche, along with many family members and early Porsche and Volkswagen associates, were significant figures within the Nazi party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Ferdinand himself was a close personal associate of Adolf Hitler and a member of the SS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

Upon joining Daimler, Ferdinand Porsche moved his family from Austria to Stuttgart, Germany, which is considered the "Detroit of the German auto industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. For two decades, he led engineering and car design for Mercedes-Benz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

### The Birth of Volkswagen
Towards the end of his tenure at Daimler-Benz, Porsche developed a concept for a small, affordable car to become Germany's first mass-market automobile, the "Volkswagen" (people's car) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. At the time, only 2% of Germans owned a car, compared to 30% of Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Daimler-Benz rejected his idea, leading to his acrimonious departure in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. The rivalry between Mercedes-Benz and Porsche continues to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

In 1931, Ferdinand Porsche started a consulting firm, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche Konstruktionen und Büros für Motoren und Fahrzeugbau, which is considered the beginning of the Porsche company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. He enlisted the financial support of his son-in-law, Anton Piëch, and Adolf Rosenberger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. Rosenberger, who was Jewish, was arrested by the Gestapo, imprisoned, and eventually bribed his way out to escape to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Porsche and the Nazis appropriated his stake in the company, and he was erased from history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.

In 1934, Porsche's new company secured a contract to design the "people's car" from Volkswagen, a company established by Adolf Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. This car would become the iconic Volkswagen Beetle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. The Beetle is likely the single longest-produced single-generation model of a car globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Hitler also founded Wolfsburg, the city where Volkswagen's group operations are still located today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.

During World War II, all Volkswagen and Porsche operations were repurposed for military vehicle production, including tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>. Ferdinand Porsche designed the Elephant anti-tank tank, the most powerful land-based tank ever created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:12]</a>. He also worked on some of the very first hybrid and electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>. The period also involved forced labor and concentration camps as part of the Nazi war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

## Post-War Re-establishment and Growth
After the war, Ferdinand Porsche and Anton Piëch were arrested by the French as war criminals and imprisoned for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>, primarily for the forced labor of imprisoned Jews in their factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:00">[23:15:00]</a>. Ferdinand's son, Ferry Porsche, was released after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.

Meanwhile, in British-controlled Wolfsburg, Major Ivan Hirst restarted Volkswagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>, placing an initial order for 20,000 Beetles for the British military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. Volkswagen, having been a political organization, was essentially an orphaned entity with no clear ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

The Porsche and Piëch families, upon release, returned to Austria where they had moved engineers and production staff to a sawmill in a farming village during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:02]</a>. Ferry and his sister Louise decided to rebuild the family business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. They started by fixing old military vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>.

Volkswagen, needing technical design and leadership, offered a "sweetheart deal" to the Porsche family: reinstatement of the German Porsche company for consulting work, and a royalty on every Beetle sold worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>. Additionally, their Austrian company gained exclusive distribution rights for Volkswagens across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>. This deal was motivated by the post-war need to rebuild West Germany's industrial base against the backdrop of the emerging Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:00">[42:00:00]</a>.

The German government implemented an unusual tax system, taxing personal income for industrialists at 95% above a certain threshold, and profits corporately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:41:00">[43:41:00]</a>. This incentivized capital reinvestment into the industrial base rather than taking profits, which significantly benefited Porsche's growth and R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:07:00">[44:07:00]</a>.

### [[porsches_evolution_from_sports_cars_to_suvs_and_sedans | Porsche's Evolution from Sports Cars to SUVs and Sedans]]
Ferry Porsche believed that small cars with enough power were more enjoyable to drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>. Using Beetle parts and its rear-mounted, air-cooled engine architecture, they created the legendary Porsche 356 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>. The 356, priced at about $42,000 in today's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:35:00">[32:35:00]</a>, became a global hit, especially in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:02:00">[53:02:00]</a>. It achieved class wins at Le Mans in 1951 and 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:12:00">[52:12:00]</a>.

In 1962, to compete with new sports cars like the Mustang and Corvette, Ferry decided to replace the 356 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:38:00">[55:38:00]</a>. His son, Ferdinand "Butzi" Porsche, led the body design, while his cousin, Ferdinand Piëch (Louise's son), designed a brilliant six-cylinder boxer engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:11:00">[57:11:00]</a>. These two projects merged to create the Porsche 901 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:02:00">[58:02:02]</a>. Peugeot, however, held a trademark in France for any car model name with an X0X format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:41:00">[58:41:00]</a>, leading Porsche to rename it the **911** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:22:00">[59:22:00]</a>. The 911 immediately became a huge success, with sales jumping significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>. Its design has remained largely consistent, making it one of the most iconic car designs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

Porsche then introduced the 912 (a 911 with a 356 engine) as a stop-gap entry-level model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. They later collaborated with Volkswagen on the mid-engined 914 Roadster in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>. This project deepened the relationship, with VW eventually taking over Porsche's distribution in America in exchange for the 914 becoming a full Porsche model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. The 914 sold over 100,000 units in its eight years on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.

## Family Drama and Professional Management
In 1970, with rising tensions between the two Ferdinand grandsons vying for control, Ferry and Louise made the surprising decision for the families to completely exit operating the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. Butzi Ferdinand Porsche went on to found Porsche Design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>, a separate company focused on product design. Ferdinand Piëch, the brilliant engine designer, was recruited to Volkswagen to turn around Audi, which at the time was a "joke" brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. Piëch's success led him to become CEO of Volkswagen in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>, overseeing the launch of the new Beetle and expanding the VW group to include brands like Lamborghini and Bugatti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:59">[01:21:59]</a>. He was even named "Car Executive of the Century" in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>.

The first professional CEO of Porsche, Ernst Fuhrmann, scrapped the 914 and introduced the front-engined, water-cooled 924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>. He also intended to replace the 911 with the 928 in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>. This period of the 1970s and 80s was challenging due to the oil crisis and new safety regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

The 911's fate was changed by American CEO Peter Schutz, who famously drew a line on a production timeline, extending the 911's future indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>. This act, though committing resources to an unplanned refresh, was a significant morale booster and became a legend within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:16">[01:31:16]</a>.

Porsche went public in the mid-1980s, selling 30% non-voting shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:12">[01:35:12]</a>. However, the economic downturn of the late 1980s and early 1990s, coupled with competition from cheaper Japanese sports cars like the Nissan 300ZX and Toyota Supra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>, led to a dramatic decline in sales. By 1992, US sales dipped to 4,100 units, worse than 1965 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:35">[01:40:35]</a>. Porsche's market cap fell to less than 400 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>, prompting speculation that the families would have to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:16">[01:41:16]</a>. During this desperate time, Porsche even took on contract manufacturing projects for Mercedes-Benz (the 500E) and Audi (the RS2 wagon), displaying Porsche branding on these non-Porsche vehicles to keep the lights on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a>.

### Wiedeking's Turnaround and [[the_economic_and_strategic_manevers_of_porsche_and_vw | Economic and Strategic Maneuvers of Porsche and VW]]
In 1993, Wendelin Wiedeking was appointed CEO. He implemented the Toyota Production System, cut product lines down to just the 911, and famously stated, "Porsche's strategy for an entry-level Porsche is a used Porsche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.

Wiedeking's bold move to develop an entry-level model that shared the front end of the 911 resulted in the highly successful mid-engine **Boxster** in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:04">[01:54:04]</a>. This strategy not only offered a true Porsche experience at a lower price point but also improved profitability through component sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>. He asserted, "We didn't want to flee from the competition into higher prices... We don't want to be Germany's Ferrari... but rather a growing fish with more room to move in a larger lake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:28">[01:56:28]</a>.

Wiedeking further expanded [[porsches_evolution_from_sports_cars_to_suvs_and_sedans | Porsche's product line]] into SUVs with the **Cayenne** in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>, and later the **Macan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:42">[02:34:42]</a>, despite initial skepticism about a Porsche SUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:15">[01:57:15]</a>. The Cayenne, co-developed with Volkswagen (which produced the Touareg), was built in a new facility in Leipzig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:58">[02:01:58]</a>. These SUVs proved to be incredibly profitable, significantly boosting Porsche's revenue and margins, particularly in the growing China market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>.

During this period, Porsche also continued to produce halo supercars like the **Carrera GT** (2003) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a> and the **918 Spyder** (early 2010s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>. The Carrera GT, often considered one of the greatest driving cars ever, was an analog supercar with a Formula 1-derived V10 engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>. The 918 Spyder introduced plug-in hybrid technology to the supercar segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:25">[02:27:25]</a>. These supercars, produced in limited quantities, served as technological showcases and bolstered the brand's performance credentials even as it expanded into more mass-market segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>.

By 2007, Porsche's market cap soared from under 400 million euros to 32 billion euros under Wiedeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:23">[02:08:23]</a>.

### Porsche's Attempted Takeover of Volkswagen
Due to German tax laws disincentivizing profit distribution and encouraging reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:27">[02:12:27]</a>, Porsche, under Wiedeking, began looking for external investments for its accumulated cash. He hatched a plan for Porsche to acquire Volkswagen, despite Ferdinand Piëch's position as VW's Chairman and CEO (and a Porsche family member on Porsche's supervisory board) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:03">[02:13:03]</a>.

In September 2005, Porsche spent $4 billion to acquire 20% of VW on the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:38">[02:15:38]</a>. They continued to buy shares, primarily using derivatives and options contracts, to circumvent the "Volkswagen Law" designed to prevent a takeover of VW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>. By 2007, Wiedeking created Porsche SE, a new publicly traded holding company, to own the family's shares in Porsche and the acquired VW shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:36">[02:17:36]</a>. He then leveraged this holding company with $10 billion in cheap debt to buy more VW shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:10">[02:18:10]</a>.

As Porsche acquired VW shares, the float of available shares shrank, leading to a massive short squeeze when Lehman Brothers collapsed in October 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>. Volkswagen briefly became the most valuable company in the world by market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:51">[02:19:51]</a>. However, this left Porsche trapped: they couldn't sell shares to service the debt without crashing the price, nor could they acquire more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:31">[02:21:31]</a>.

Ferdinand Piëch, still Chairman of VW and on Porsche's board, seized the opportunity. VW publicly announced that Porsche was no longer financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:54">[02:22:54]</a> and offered to "bail out" Porsche by purchasing the Porsche operating company for a significantly lower valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:55">[02:23:55]</a>. Wiedeking was forced out in January 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>. VW acquired the Porsche operating company in two tranches, totaling about 8.5 billion euros, by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:32">[02:24:32]</a>.

Ironically, the Porsche and Piëch families emerged as the largest shareholders in the VW group, with 32% ownership and over 50% voting power, effectively controlling VW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:08">[02:25:08]</a>.

### Modern Porsche
Porsche sales remained resilient even during the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:51">[02:26:51]</a>, partly due to strategic investments in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>. Porsche also introduced the electric **Taycan** in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:40">[02:35:40]</a>, showcasing its commitment to electrification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:20">[02:29:20]</a>.

In September 2022, Porsche AG re-IPO'd as the largest European IPO of all time, with an initial market cap of $75 billion, rising to about $115 billion within nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:12">[02:40:12]</a>. The family still maintains control of both VW and Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:32">[02:42:32]</a>. Today, Porsche generates over $40 billion in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:19">[02:43:19]</a>, with two-thirds coming from SUVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:27">[02:43:27]</a>. China is its largest market, where demand is predominantly for four-door cars like SUVs and sedans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:56">[02:43:56]</a>.

Porsche's brand power is evident in its gross margins (29%), significantly higher than BMW (17%) and Mercedes (23%), though lower than Ferrari (48%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:20">[02:51:20]</a>. Porsche's ability to operate at scale (350,000 cars/year) while maintaining a luxury perception is unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The brand's [[the_influence_of_porsches_brand_and_german_engineering | German engineering]] reputation, perceived quality, and iconic designs contribute to its enduring appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:47">[02:56:47]</a>.

Porsche's marketing has often been bold and counter-positioning, such as the famous "Kills bugs fast" tagline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>. The brand thrives on continuity, offering "fan service" to generations of enthusiasts who have dreamed of owning a Porsche since childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:33">[03:03:33]</a>. Its deep heritage in racing, particularly endurance races like Le Mans, further reinforces its performance image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:55">[03:02:55]</a>.

Today, Porsche's brand is considered indestructible; even if the company faced bankruptcy, its immense brand value would ensure its resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:02">[03:13:02]</a>.

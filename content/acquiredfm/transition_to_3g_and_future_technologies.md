## [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]]'s Dominance in 3G

The first [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] networks went live in the US and internationally in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. By the year 2000, as the next generation of cell phone networks, 3G, emerged, [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] became the dominant technology globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Despite debates in the US between GSM and [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]], all 3G networks eventually became [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]]-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This was because 3G prioritized data speeds and broadband internet, where [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] was a vastly superior technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Its digital-native structure perfectly lent itself to handling digital information like website downloads, iMessages, or tweets, as it was already in packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]]'s Strategic Shift and Early Success

[[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]]'s early revenue in 1995 was $383 million, growing to $814 million in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. However, Wall Street initially viewed the stock negatively due to the capital-intensive manufacturing operations and joint ventures, which tied up company profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The stock remained largely flat until January 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

In 1999, [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] made key [[strategic_decisions_in_the_telecommunications_industry | strategic decisions]] to divest from hardware manufacturing:
*   **March 1999**: They sold their infrastructure business (base stations) to Ericsson, a former competitor, as part of a licensing and settlement deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This indicated their belief that they no longer needed to bootstrap their strategy with manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Approximately 1,000 [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] employees transferred to Ericsson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **December 1999**: Kyocera bought [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]]'s mobile phone business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

These moves transformed [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] into two primary groups:
1.  **[[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] Technologies Group (QTC)**: Focused on selling chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
2.  **[[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] Technology Licensing (QTL)**: Focused on licensing their extensive [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | patent]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This established their business model: producing high-margin semiconductor designs (without fabrication) and collecting high-margin licensing revenue from their [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | patent]] chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This model allowed them to charge a percentage of phone sales, leveraging their fundamental [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | patents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Incredible Stock Performance in 2000
Following the offloading of their manufacturing businesses, [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] became the single best-performing stock for the entire year 2000, amidst the tech bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The stock appreciated by 2,621% in 366 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, it crashed down over the next 18 months, becoming only a 4x return from its pre-1999 high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Transition to 4G and Beyond

### Leadership Change and Strategic Acquisitions
In 2005, [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]]'s founder, Irwin Jacobs, retired as CEO and Chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. His son, Paul Jacobs, who holds a PhD in electrical engineering and had spent his entire career at [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]], took over as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Also in 2005, [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] acquired Flarian Technologies for $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This acquisition was crucial as Flarian possessed many [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | patents]] essential for 4G technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It allowed [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] to "refill the pot of missiles" (a metaphor for [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | patents]]) needed for the next generation of wireless communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Shift to OFDMA and Snapdragon Development
While 4G eventually became based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), which was more efficient than [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] initially resisted this shift, pushing for [[CDMA and its impact on mobile communication | CDMA]] to remain the standard for 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. However, they eventually pivoted to OFDMA, securing [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | patents]] through acquisitions like Flarian, which enabled them to maintain their business model for 4G and LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

During Paul Jacobs's tenure (2005-2013/2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, a key [[strategic_decisions_in_the_telecommunications_industry | strategic initiative]] was getting [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] into IoT (Internet of Things), which did not fully materialize at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. However, two significant successes during this period were the OFDMA patent acquisition and the development of the Snapdragon mobile systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. These developments positioned [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] exceptionally well for the modern smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Today, [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] sells the high-end Android chip, with products like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 becoming the standard for premium Android phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. They have also branded many of their diverse silicon and chip designs under the Snapdragon label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Continued Value Capture and Litigation
Today, [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] earns an average of about $20 for every smartphone sold worldwide, including Apple iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This significant value capture, driven by their [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | patent]] licensing and chip sales, began to draw public and legal scrutiny around 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. While [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]] remains a pioneer and invests heavily in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, they became known in the ecosystem as "value capture pioneers," leading to anti-trust lawsuits from entities like Apple and the Department of Justice/FTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

Ultimately, [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | Qualcomm]]'s current total revenue is close to $40 billion annually, with 85% coming from their semiconductor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means about $37 billion of their $44 billion revenue stems from selling semiconductors, a business that would not exist without their initial [[strategic_decisions_in_the_telecommunications_industry | strategic decision]] to focus on [[Qualcomms technological innovations and patents | patent]] licensing and chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. They are now the largest fabless semiconductor company globally, surpassing Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

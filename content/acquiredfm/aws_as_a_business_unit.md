The origins of [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] involve four separate [[AWS origin stories | origin stories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Understanding these stories reveals important insights into what [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] is, as well as [[Amazons strategy in cloud storage and machine learning | Amazon's strategy]] and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The "Excess Capacity" Myth

One common, yet untrue, [[AWS origin stories | origin story]] for [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] is the "excess capacity narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This story suggests that around 2001-2003, Amazon.com's retail business, being highly seasonal, had huge spikes in demand and traffic in Q4 for the holiday shopping season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. To handle this peak demand, Amazon had to build out significant technical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The urban legend claims that during quarters one through three, this infrastructure had [[amazons_strategy_in_cloud_storage_and_machine_learning | excess technical capacity]] that was sitting idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The "brilliant realization" was supposedly to rent out this excess capacity to other developers, turning a large expense into a revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

However, this narrative faces significant challenges:
*   **Technical Implausibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>: In a pre-cloud technology company, infrastructure was not easily shared or rented out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Servers were highly customized, tightly coupled to applications, and lacked the necessary security and networking for multi-tenancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Amazon.com's code base was literally installed on owned servers, like DEC Alpha servers, which were part of highly bundled, high-margin hardware-software platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Operational Conflict** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>: If [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] customers relied on excess capacity, Amazon would not be able to serve them during their peak Q4 season when the infrastructure was needed for the retail business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This would be unsustainable for any customer, let alone large ones like Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The shift to open-source systems like Linux and less expensive hardware from companies like HP allowed Amazon to move away from monolithic, expensive bundled platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This move, which involved a massive rewrite of Amazon.com to run on Linux and HP servers, was critical for saving the company from a cost perspective during a financially tight period around 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. However, this transition to open source was not the same as creating virtualized cloud servers for external use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Debunking the Myth

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>

He further clarified that [[Amazon Web Services AWS | Amazon Web Services]] was *always* considered a business by itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Intentional Strategy

The "excess capacity" myth also underplays Amazon's true [[intentionality_and_strategy_behind_AWS | intentionality and strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Technology was never viewed as a cost center for Amazon; rather, they always considered themselves a technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. They consistently looked at technology as an investment, anticipating future capabilities enabled by advancements like Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

The creation of [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] was an incredibly [[intentionality_and_strategy_behind_AWS | intentional strategy]], reflecting a laser focus on creating a brand new business in an emerging market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] was launched with the expectation that it could grow to be as large as the Amazon.com retail operation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This perspective highlights [[AWSs market dynamics and strategic approach | Amazon's strategic foresight]] in establishing [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] as a distinct and significant business unit from its inception.

The podcast *Acquired* focuses on [[history_and_strategy_of_technology_companies | great technology companies and the stories and playbooks behind them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. The hosts reflected on the major tech companies and industry trends that stood out in 2022, observing shifts in strategic vision, business models, and the impact of new technologies.

## Evolution of Security and Compliance

The security and compliance sector has seen a significant evolution, moving beyond mere "check the box" defense to becoming an offensive strategy for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. According to Vanta's CEO, Christina Cacioppo, proving security to buyers has become "table stakes" for B2B companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This shift allows companies to unlock new markets, including enterprise, healthcare, and regulated industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. In the 2022 funding environment, secure and trusted revenue growth is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Companies are increasingly scrutinized, as they are "only as secure as their vendors are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This focus helps startups prove their credibility, even without the tenure of established competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Company Deep Dives and Lessons Learned

### Sony's Resilience and Diversification
Sony's journey was highlighted for its remarkable resilience and diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The company was founded by "genius founder[s]" who overcame immense adversity, particularly in Japan in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. A notable aspect of Sony is its structure, with five separate business units each contributing a double-digit percentage to both revenue and operating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The PlayStation's story alone could fill an entire episode, showcasing the company's dynamic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Nvidia's Strategic Gambles
Nvidia's story is defined by CEO Jensen Huang's willingness to "bet the company" three separate times on significant [[strategic_vision_and_business_pivots_in_the_tech_industry | strategic pivots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. These included shipping a card in nine months instead of two years (designed in emulation, never fully tested) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>, a bet on programmable shaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, and a seven-year investment in AI and CUDA before the market was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. Nvidia's stock surge was driven by its AI prospects, not just gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. The company is now a central player in the "AI Renaissance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

### Walmart: The First Applied Tech Company?
The discussion around Walmart highlighted its early adoption of technology, leading to a debate about whether it was the "first applied technology company" in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

> "they were a company who did business in an established sector... and they transformed the way they worked and ultimately the whole sector by applying technology to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

Walmart used technology to create a more efficient supply chain and distribution system, enabling them to offer lower prices and attract more customers, thereby making their financials work in a way that traditional retailers could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

## The Impact of AI on the Tech Landscape

2022 saw the emergence of "three pretty amazing proof of concepts" in AI: Dolly 2, GPT-3, and ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. ChatGPT, released in late 2022, was deemed the most interesting due to its changed modalityâ€”it's stateful, allowing for more conversational and follow-up interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. This new wave of AI is likened to the "crypto moment" where the concept of a decentralized world computer unlocked possibilities, even if the specific applications were not immediately clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

> "I feel very similar with chat gbt right now I'm looking at I'm like whoa this unlocks a whole world of possibilities and someone says what is it and I'm like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

The hosts observed that while many can see obvious business use cases (e.g., dynamically rewriting website copy), these are "the to-do list version of what right AI can do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>, implying much larger, unforeseen applications are yet to be discovered.

## Challenges and Future Outlook in Tech

The podcast also touched on broader [[challenges_and_strategies_for_major_tech_companies | challenges and strategies for major tech companies]]. The hosts expressed a desire to cover more "big tech companies" like [[impact_of_major_tech_companies_like_apple_facebook_and_microsoft | Microsoft]] and [[impact_of_major_tech_companies_like_apple_facebook_and_microsoft | Apple]] in future episodes, recognizing that these would require multi-part series due to their extensive [[corporate_strategy_and_organizational_change_in_tech_companies | corporate strategy and organizational change in tech companies]] and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

There was a conscious decision to avoid topics like Twitter's recent turmoil and FTX's collapse, as the hosts felt they could not add new insights beyond what prominent tech journalists and analysts were already covering in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This highlights their focus on delivering unique value through deep research and long-form analysis, rather than breaking news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The Enron episode, for example, was chosen to draw indirect parallels to FTX, allowing listeners to form their own conclusions based on historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

Looking ahead, Open AI is a strong candidate for a future episode, as its rapid advancements make the topic increasingly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. The discussion also considered the [[impact_of_technology_and_investment_on_society | impact of technology and investment on society]], noting the evolution of companies like Walmart and the broader implications of venture capital through books like *The Power Law* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:22">[01:59:22]</a>.

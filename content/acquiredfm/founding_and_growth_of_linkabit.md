Linkabit was a groundbreaking company co-founded by Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi, pivotal in the development of digital communications and satellite technology, ultimately leading to the formation of Qualcomm.

## Irwin Jacobs: Early Life and Academic Career

Irwin Mark Jacobs was born in 1933 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, an area that was once the wealthiest town in America during the whaling era but had changed significantly by his birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. He grew up in a middle-class family; his father ran a local restaurant called the Boston Beef Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Jacobs was highly gifted in math and sciences, though his high school guidance counselor advised him against pursuing these fields in New Bedford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The counselor encouraged him to attend Cornell School of Hotel Management to work in the family business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Jacobs spent a year and a half in hotel management at Cornell, which he later credited with helping him understand business accounting and real-world applications, ultimately aiding him in starting his first company and Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

He then transferred to electrical engineering at Cornell, despite initial skepticism from the dean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Jacobs graduated and went on to complete his PhD at MIT in just three years, finishing in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. He studied under Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, who had returned to MIT as a professor after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

After earning his PhD, Jacobs was asked to stay on as a professor at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He taught there for five years, during which he taught one of the world's first courses on digital communications and co-authored the first textbook on digital communications, which remains in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Formation of Linkabit

In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical from MIT to work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California on the U.S. Space Program, focusing on satellite communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. There, he met Andrew (Andy) Viterbi, another MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate, and they became close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Upon his return to Boston, Jacobs received an offer to establish the electrical engineering department at the new UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. He accepted and moved with his family to San Diego, continuing his contracting work with defense contractors and JPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The idea for Linkabit emerged when Jacobs, Viterbi, and a third professor from UCLA were consulting at NASA Ames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. They decided to form a "shell company" to manage their consulting work and gain efficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This company, which they jokingly named Linkabit ("linking a bit"), was initially not intended to be a "real company" that made products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The third partner, Len Kleinrock, later left Linkabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Kleinrock went on to become a core founding father of the internet, notably sending the first message on ARPANET from UCLA to Stanford with a grad student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Initial Focus: Defense and Satellite Communications

Jacobs and Viterbi primarily focused on NASA and Navy defense projects in San Diego, a U.S. Navy town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Their expertise lay in satellite communications, which required highly efficient use of narrow bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This work led them to utilize spread spectrum technology, an old patented technology from the World War II era invented by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

Linkabit began recruiting other professors and grad students, building an "Army of the greatest information theory and wireless signal minds in the country" for defense contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. In 1971, with the company growing significantly, Jacobs took a sabbatical from UCSD to organize Linkabit and never returned to his professorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Transition to Commercial Ventures

During this period, Linkabit realized that defense contractors were making most of the money as prime bidders, while Linkabit was doing the specialized engineering work as a subconsultant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This led them to decide to start bidding on contracts themselves and move into the commercial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

Linkabit's first major commercial project involved building the satellite communication system for [[Walmartcoms Early Business Strategy and Growth | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. [[Walmartcoms Early Business Strategy and Growth | Walmart]], known for its innovation in retail, invested tens of millions of dollars in the late 1970s and early 1980s to create a private satellite relay system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. This system was crucial for tabulating daily store data and allowed founder Sam Walton to broadcast messages from headquarters to all local stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

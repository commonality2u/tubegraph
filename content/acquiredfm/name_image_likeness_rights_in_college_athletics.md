The issue of name, image, and likeness (NIL) rights in college athletics is a "pretty messy" situation, primarily revolving around the long-standing rule that prevented college athletes from profiting from their own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. This rule did not make sense, as college athletes were unique in America for being unable to monetize their NIL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>.

## Historical Context

Former college football player Anthony Gonzalez, who played at Ohio State and later in the [[the_nfl_and_its_evolution | NFL]], noted that while college athletics was a great experience, there was a sense of disconnect seeing people wear his jersey or his autographs selling on eBay without him receiving any compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. This issue wasn't limited to high-profile football players; a college swimmer at Stanford, for example, was not permitted to teach swimming lessons to help pay bills, despite being a prime candidate for such work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

The initial catalyst for change came a couple of years ago when the state of California passed a bill to legalize NIL in the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>. This triggered a "whole chain reaction" of states passing their own differing laws, creating a "chaos" that distorted the market by giving an advantage to athletes in states with NIL laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>.

At its core, the issue was that the NCAA prohibited athletes from monetizing their NIL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>. Congressional efforts aimed to establish a national standard to legalize NIL, provide economic rights for athletes, and build in guardrails against inducements and recruiting violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.

## Current State: The Wild West

Ultimately, the NCAA lost a Supreme Court case, leading them to legalize NIL but declare that they would not enforce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>. This decision ushered in what is now referred to as the "wild west" of NIL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.

Key features of this current landscape include:
*   **Collectives:** Groups of boosters, unaffiliated with universities, raise money for "marketing dollars" to acquire players on behalf of teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>.
*   **Recruiting Impact:** Quarterbacks signing NIL deals worth millions of dollars are now common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** There is no transparency regarding commissions taken by individuals who broker these deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>. While [[the_nfl_and_its_evolution | NFL]] agents are capped at 3% commission, NIL deals are estimated to have "big haircuts" closer to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.
*   **Coach Limitations:** Coaches are handicapped as they are at the mercy of collectives, unable to directly promise players NIL deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>.

This "broken market" is seen as unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>.

## The Future and Trade-offs

Without congressional intervention to stabilize the system, college athletics risks becoming fully professionalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. This professionalization carries significant trade-offs:
*   **Sport Cuts:** Most schools would likely cut every sport that doesn't generate revenue, except for those mandated by Title IX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a>. This would drastically shrink athletic departments, focusing primarily on football and men's basketball, which typically generate the money to fund other sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>.
    *   For example, Ohio State's football program, partly due to [[nikes_marketing_and_branding | Nike]]'s use of the University of Oregon as a testing ground, was noted to pay for every other sport, making the athletic department profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>.
*   **Reduced Opportunity:** The elimination of non-revenue sports would remove significant opportunities for athletes from various backgrounds, including minority backgrounds, who often rely on sports as a path to education and upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.

The argument for a national standard for NIL is that it would allow athletes to market themselves fairly, while building in guardrails to ensure athletes are not exploited by disproportionate agent commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:36">[01:26:36]</a>. The core belief is that if a college swimmer wants to teach lessons to help pay for school, they should be able to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>.

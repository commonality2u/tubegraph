Initially, Wall Street held a negative view of Qualcomm's stock, which remained largely flat up until January 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The company's capital-intensive manufacturing operations and joint ventures consumed a significant amount of profits, which led to the stock being "punished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Strategic Shifts in 1999

In 1999, [[Qualcomms strategic business decisions in 1999 | Qualcomm]] began to recognize that its manufacturing operations were a substantial drain on its business, tying up potential free cash flow and limiting reinvestment in research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

To address this, Qualcomm made two significant divestments:
*   **March 1999:** They sold their infrastructure business (base stations) to Ericsson, a former competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This sale was part of a settlement deal resolving various lawsuits between the companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This decision marked a shift away from making their own base stations, indicating a belief that they had enough momentum without needing to bootstrap their strategy with manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Approximately 1,000 of Qualcomm's 9,500 employees transferred to Ericsson as part of this deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **December 1999:** Kyocera acquired Qualcomm's mobile phone business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

These divestments removed the "drag" of capital-intensive manufacturing operations from Qualcomm's business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Following these sales, Qualcomm focused solely on two groups:
*   **Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Group (QTC):** Responsible for selling chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL):** Responsible for licensing their extensive patent portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Stock Performance in 2000

The year 2000, at the height of the tech bubble, saw an extraordinary surge in Qualcomm's stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Qualcomm became the single best-performing stock for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Unprecedented Growth
> In 2000, Qualcomm's stock appreciated by 2621% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, or 26.2 times its value, in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

However, this peak was short-lived. The stock did not maintain its high value for long and crashed over the subsequent 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Despite the crash, it still represented a 4x return from its pre-1999 high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

Robert "Bob" Kagle, a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI), played a pivotal role in the early dynamics of Silicon Valley venture capital and the eventual formation of Benchmark Capital. His upbringing and staunch beliefs in fairness significantly shaped his professional path and left a lasting impact on the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Education
Bob Kagle grew up in Flint, Michigan, a city facing hard times, where his mother was a single mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. His entire family worked on the production lines for General Motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Kagle was the first member of his family to go to college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

He attended General Motors University, described as a "quasi-vocational school" designed to train General Motors employees' families for work in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. After working at the company for a period, he gained admission to the prestigious Stanford Business School (GSB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. While at GSB, he met and intersected with Dave Marquardt, who had graduated a few years prior and would later invite him to join TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Before TVI, Bob worked in consulting at Boston Consulting Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Career at Technology Venture Investors (TVI)
Bob Kagle joined TVI, a venture capital firm known for its successful investment in Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. During his time at TVI, Kagle performed well, contributing to successful investments in companies like Synopsis, Avant, and Viosoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Despite his success, he began to feel resentment towards the firm's economic structure after a decade, believing that the senior partners were "holding on to the keys to the firm and all the economics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Motivation for Equal Partnership
Bob Kagle harbored significant resentment for the perceived privilege of the older generation in venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This perspective was deeply rooted in his background, coming from a "Hard Scrabble" environment in Flint, Michigan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

He developed an "almost religious fervor" for the idea that "anything other than an equal partnership was just like morally wrong for a venture capital firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. This belief was driven by a strong "sense of fairness," a conviction about "morally like what is the right thing to do," and the principle of "proper rewards for proper work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Economics also played a "core motivation," as he felt he was doing the work while others were unfairly profiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

Kagle's vision of an equal partnership meant that every partner in a given fund would have equal carry, and all current General Partners (GPs) would own the management company without having to pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

## Role in TVI's Dissolution and Benchmark's Formation
Kagle's strong conviction about equal partnership became a major point of contention at TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. When discussions within the firm failed to reach a resolution, the senior partners decided to "declare victory" and effectively close down TVI, managing out existing funds and board seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Kagle would have preferred to stay at TVI and convert it to an equal partnership, but since that wasn't possible, he had to seek out a new path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

His belief in equal partnership was so deep that he felt it was "worth not continuing at this firm or perhaps even not continuing this firm period in order to realize this dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

In early 1994, Kagle approached his friend Bruce Dunleavy, who he had interned for at BCG, to propose starting a new firm together based on the equal partnership model, with an eye on the emerging internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. This move demonstrated Kagle's "incredible amount of maturity" and "obsessive sense of fairness" by asking a former subordinate to be his equal partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

After Bruce initially declined due to lacking the financial safety net, the idea of equal economics spread to Merrill Pickard, where Bruce and Andy Ratcliffe worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. When their firm also resisted the idea, Kagle, Dunleavy, and Ratcliffe decided to burn the boats and commit to forming a new venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

They eventually recruited Kevin Harvey, an entrepreneur, and Val Vaden, who had experience in software company buyouts, to join them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. Together, Bob Kagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, Kevin Harvey, and Val Vaden formed the five co-founders of Benchmark Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. The name "Benchmark Capital" itself was chosen to signal their aspiration to set a new standard for performance and venture capital practices in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[0:18:00]</a>.

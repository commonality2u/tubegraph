A core [[investing_strategies_and_approaches | investment approach]] over the last decade has been the view that "not all software is created equal" and "not all AR is created equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This nuanced perspective informs the development of specific investment theses.

## Historical Context and Market Trends
In 2000, the database sector was the largest area of software, with companies principally driving revenue from databases having an aggregate enterprise value of approximately one trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Looking forward, a significant trend identified is the exponential growth of data; every year, more data is produced than in all previous years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This data needs a home, and the expectation is that more sensors will be built to gather even more data in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This analysis is crucial for [[evaluating_future_potential_of_companies | evaluating future potential of companies]].

## Vision for Future Data Utilization
This investment thesis is further supported by a vision articulated by Bill Gates. When asked if "all the interesting stuff [was] done," Gates responded by highlighting the "barbaric" way decisions are currently made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. He predicted that in the future, all data would be stored, and machines would analyze this data to aid in making better decisions, such as:
*   Diagnosing illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Educating dyslexic children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Maintaining aircraft engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

This future state envisions decisions predominantly made by machines analyzing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Specific Investment Focus: Cloud Infrastructure
Based on these insights, a strong view was formed that the entire database market would be remade, specifically in the cloud and purpose-built for the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This led to a significant focus on the infrastructure layer in the cloud and the enablement required for enterprises to migrate to the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | investment strategy and decision making]] proved to be a "rich vein" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

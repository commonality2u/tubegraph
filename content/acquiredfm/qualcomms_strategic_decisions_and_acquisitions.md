[[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm's]] current annual revenue is close to $40 billion, with 85% coming from its semiconductor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means about $37 billion of its $44 billion revenue stems from selling semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This significant revenue stream would not exist without a pivotal [[strategic_decisions_and_leadership_in_technology_companies | strategic decision]] made years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Today, [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] stands as the largest fabless semiconductor company globally, surpassing Nvidia, which is ranked second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Early Success and Business Model Development

The adoption of CDMA as a major 2G standard was a significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This led to [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] achieving a 57% market share in the US for 2G, 100% market share in countries like South Korea, and massive market share in China, which was adopting mobile technology for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The first year these networks went live in the US and internationally was 1995, with [[Qualcomms financial history and stock performance | Qualcomm]] reporting $383 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. By 1996, revenue surged to $814 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Despite this rapid growth, [[Qualcomms financial history and stock performance | Wall Street's reception was negative]], with the stock remaining largely flat until January 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The reason for this stagnation was the significant capital required for manufacturing operations and joint ventures, which tied up the company's profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Pivotal Divestitures and Refocusing (1999)

In 1999, [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] realized that its capital-intensive manufacturing operations were a serious drag on the business, diverting potential free cash flow and R&D investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This led to two critical divestitures:
*   **Infrastructure Business Sale (March 1999):** [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] sold its base station infrastructure business to Ericsson, a former competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This sale was part of a licensing and lawsuit settlement deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Approximately 1,000 of [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm's]] 9,500 employees transferred to Ericsson as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Mobile Phone Business Sale (December 1999):** Kyocera, a Japanese company, acquired [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm's]] mobile phone business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

With these divestitures, [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] solidified its new business model, focusing on two core groups:
*   **Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Group (QTC):** Selling chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL):** Licensing its patent portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This strategy allowed [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] to generate very high-margin revenue from [[Qualcomms patent strategy and economic impact | licenses to its patent war chest]] and sell high-margin semiconductor designs, as they did not fab any of the semiconductors themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. [[Qualcomms patent strategy and economic impact | Their patent monetization strategy]] involved charging a percentage of phone sales, leveraging their extensive patent ownership to maintain market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## The Dot-Com Bubble and 3G Dominance

The strategic shift proved incredibly timely. In 2000, amidst the height of the tech bubble, [[Qualcomms financial history and stock performance | Qualcomm stock]] was the single best-performing stock of the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. It appreciated an astonishing 2,621% in 366 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, this peak was short-lived, with the stock crashing over the next 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

For the next generation of cell phone networks, 3G, [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] effectively "ran the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Despite initial debates between GSM and CDMA standards, nearly all 3G networks worldwide adopted CDMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This was because 3G was primarily focused on broadband internet data speeds, and CDMA was vastly superior for handling digital information and packet data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Leadership Transition and Strategic Acquisitions for 4G

In 2005, [[Founding of Qualcomm and contributions to the wireless industry | Irwin Jacobs]] retired as CEO and chairman of [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. His son, Paul Jacobs, who held a PhD in electrical engineering and had spent his entire career at the company, took over as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Also in 2005, [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] made a significant acquisition:
*   **Flarian Technologies Acquisition:** [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] purchased Flarian Technologies for $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Flarian possessed a crucial portfolio of patents that would become essential for 4G technology, specifically OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This acquisition allowed [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] to continue its business model by owning the necessary patents for 4G and LTE going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## The Paul Jacobs Era and Snapdragon

The Paul Jacobs era (2005-2013/14) is viewed with mixed results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. His main [[strategic_decisions_and_leadership_in_technology_companies | strategic initiative]] was to expand [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] into the Internet of Things (IoT), which did not fully materialize at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

However, two key successes emerged during his tenure:
1.  **Pivot to OFDMA:** Initially, [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] resisted OFDMA, aiming to keep CDMA as the 4G standard. They eventually pivoted, embracing OFDMA, which was more efficient than the aging CDMA technology for 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
2.  **[[Impact and evolution of Qualcomms Snapdragon technology | Snapdragon]] Development:** This period saw the beginning of [[Impact and evolution of Qualcomms Snapdragon technology | Qualcomm's Snapdragon]] mobile systems-on-a-chip (SoCs), including CPUs and advanced processing capabilities for early smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This positioned them strongly for the modern smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Today, [[Impact and evolution of Qualcomms Snapdragon technology | Snapdragon]] chips power high-end Android phones, while Apple uses its own A-series chips for iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The [[Impact and evolution of Qualcomms Snapdragon technology | Snapdragon]] brand is now broadly applied across many of [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm's]] diverse silicon and chip designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

Today, [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]] earns an average of about $20 for every smartphone sold globally, including Apple iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This period also marked the beginning of extensive litigation for [[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm]], as its reputation shifted from a technology pioneer to a "value capture pioneer" in the eyes of customers and the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## Facebook's Introduction of Newsfeed and Platform

Facebook's evolution saw a significant shift from being merely a social network to a comprehensive social media platform, largely driven by the introduction of its Newsfeed and the subsequent opening of its API to developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This transformation fundamentally redefined online social interaction and laid the groundwork for [[Facebooks growth and challenges | Facebook's future growth and monetization strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:09">[03:59:09]</a>.

### The Newsfeed: Redefining Social Engagement

Before the Newsfeed, [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]] users would visit individual profiles to see if anything had changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:24">[02:09:24]</a>. The company observed this behavior and initially implemented a "hacky" solution by highlighting changes on profiles in yellow to make updates more obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:41">[02:09:41]</a>. This test confirmed user interest in easily discovering updates, leading to the development of the Newsfeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:57">[02:09:57]</a>.

#### Technical Innovation and User Reaction
Launched on September 5, 2006, the Newsfeed was a massive paradigm shift in how users consumed content on social platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:20">[02:14:20]</a>. Building a feed was technically challenging, requiring advanced engineering to aggregate and rank updates from an N-squared problem of user connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>. This marked a new level of engineering prowess for [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]], pushing the state-of-the-art in web technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">[02:08:42]</a>.

The launch, which was rolled out to all users simultaneously without an opt-in, sparked significant backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:33">[02:14:33]</a>. [[Mark Zuckerbergs reflections on the early days of Facebook | Users]] sent 30,000 angry emails to support on the first day, and 10% of the global user base joined a [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]] group called "Students Against [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]] Newsfeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>. The irony was that the very tool enabling this protest was the Newsfeed itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:19">[02:15:19]</a>.

The core of the outrage stemmed from a shift in user expectations regarding privacy and information flow:
> "people react really strongly when you change the ease of obtaining that information or whether it feels like you are pushing that information out versus someone is sort of pulling by going to your profile and viewing it went from pull to push" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:17">[02:16:17]</a>.

Despite the uproar, internal data showed that engagement skyrocketed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:46">[02:17:46]</a>. [[Mark Zuckerbergs reflections on the early days of Facebook | Mark Zuckerberg]] addressed the controversy with a post titled "Calm down, breathe, we hear you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:05">[02:18:05]</a>, announcing controls for users to manage what activities appeared in their Newsfeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:14">[02:18:14]</a>. Within two weeks, users adapted, and engagement continued to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:05">[02:19:05]</a>.

#### Impact on Revenue and Future Strategy
While Newsfeed initially hurt revenue due to fewer page views (as users no longer had to click through multiple profiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:21">[02:17:21]</a>, it ultimately redefined [[Role of Social Media in Modern Tech and Finance | social media]] by adding a "media component" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:14">[02:20:14]</a>. This laid the foundation for the future of in-feed advertising, a highly valuable ad unit that would later become crucial for [[Impact of mobile on Facebook | Facebook's mobile monetization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:09">[03:59:09]</a>.

### The Platform: Becoming a Developer Ecosystem
The concept of a platform was part of [[Mark Zuckerbergs reflections on the early days of Facebook | Mark Zuckerberg]]'s original product roadmap from 2005, initially envisioned as an "I'm bored" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:38">[02:24:38]</a>. The goal was to transform [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]] into a developer platform, emulating companies like Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:16">[02:25:16]</a>.

#### Launch and Early Success
On May 24, 2007, [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]] launched its developer platform, f8, announcing the opening of the Facebook API (Graph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:14">[02:26:14]</a>. At this point, [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]] had over 20 million users and was growing by more than 100,000 users daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The platform offered developers two key advantages: user attention and a wealth of data about each person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:34">[02:26:34]</a>.

The response from developers was overwhelming, with 5,000 developers joining within two days, far exceeding the initial goal of 5,000 in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:03">[02:30:03]</a>. This enabled the creation of new social applications, like games and quizzes, that could be played with friends directly on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:18">[02:28:18]</a>.

#### Challenges and Evolution
Despite the initial success, the platform faced inherent challenges. As a web-based platform built on top of browsers and operating systems, it was several layers of abstraction away from the hardware, which eventually limited its durability compared to platforms controlling the underlying hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:25">[02:32:25]</a>.

Initially, [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]]'s platform relied heavily on organic distribution through Newsfeed, where app activities would appear in users' feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:49">[02:34:49]</a>. However, this led to spam and a decline in user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:52">[02:34:52]</a>. [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]] eventually pulled back on organic Newsfeed distribution for apps, which severely impacted many developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:35">[02:34:35]</a>.

This shift, while initially disruptive, was a crucial long-term move for [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:57">[02:34:57]</a>. Developers with scale then turned to [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]]'s native advertising to drive usage back to their apps, creating a new, profitable arbitrage opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:28">[02:35:28]</a>. This solidified the advertising business model as a core component of the platform, monetizing user engagement, in-app commerce (via [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook Credits]]), and eventually, app distribution itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:48">[02:35:48]</a>.

The introduction of the "Like" button in 2009 further propelled the platform's reach. While invented by FriendFeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:02">[03:12:02]</a>, [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]] adopted it and extended its use, allowing third-party websites to embed [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]]'s JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:17">[03:16:17]</a>. This not only boosted engagement but also provided a continuous stream of data for [[Facebooks growth and challenges | Facebook's sophisticated advertising algorithms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:44">[03:16:44]</a>.

By 2010, [[History of Meta and Facebook | Facebook]] had reached 600 million users and achieved $2 billion in revenue, demonstrating the immense success of its Newsfeed and Platform strategies on the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:07">[03:18:07]</a>. However, the impending [[Impact of mobile on Facebook | shift to mobile]] would soon present new existential threats to this established dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:45">[03:18:45]</a>.

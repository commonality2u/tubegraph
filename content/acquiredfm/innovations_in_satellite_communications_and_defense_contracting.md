## The Genesis of a Pioneer: Erwin Jacobs

Erwin Mark Jacobs, born in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1933, exhibited exceptional giftedness in mathematics and sciences from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite a high school guidance counselor advising him against a future in math and science in New Bedford, Jacobs initially pursued a degree in hotel management at Cornell University, a path suggested for him to return to his family's restaurant, the Boston Beef Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

During his year and a half in hotel management, Jacobs gained valuable business and accounting knowledge, which he later credited for helping him transition from academia to entrepreneurship, particularly in founding Linkabit and Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Realizing his true passion lay in engineering, he transferred to electrical engineering at Cornell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Academic Roots and Early Impact

After graduating from Cornell, Jacobs went on to earn his PhD from MIT in just three years, completing it in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. His doctoral studies were conducted under Claude Shannon, the acclaimed "father of information theory," who had returned to MIT as a professor after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This mentorship was crucial for Jacobs's future contributions to the wireless and communications industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Jacobs's talent led MIT and Shannon to ask him to stay on as a professor immediately after his PhD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. During his five years teaching at MIT, he taught the world's first course on digital communications, applying Shannon's theories for practical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. He also co-authored the first textbook on digital communications, which remains a foundational text in the field today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical to JPL (Jet Propulsion Labs) to work on the U.S. Space Program, focusing on [[the_evolution_and_potential_of_defense_technology | communications with satellites]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. There, he met Andrew Viterbi, another MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate, and they quickly became close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Jacobs later moved to San Diego to establish the electrical engineering department at the new UC San Diego, inviting Viterbi to join him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## From Academia to Entrepreneurship: Linkabit

While at UCSD, Jacobs continued his [[analysis_of_modern_defense_contracting | contracting work with defense contractors]] and JPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Recognizing the challenges of balancing academic roles with consulting, Jacobs, Viterbi, and a third professor, Len Kleinrock, decided to form a "shell company" in 1968 to manage their consulting work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. They humorously named it "Linkabit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Len Kleinrock, though initially a partner, later left to become a foundational figure in the development of the internet, leading the ARPANET project at DARPA and sending the first internet message from UCLA to Stanford with his grad student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Defense Contracting and the Shift to Commercial Ventures

Jacobs and Viterbi continued with Linkabit, primarily focusing on NASA and Navy [[analysis_of_modern_defense_contracting | defense projects]] in San Diego, a significant U.S. Navy town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Their work heavily involved satellite communications, a field where bandwidth is very narrow, necessitating extreme efficiency in data transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This focus on efficiency led them to work with an old patented spread spectrum technology from World War II, initially invented by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This exposure to efficient communication methods was crucial for the future of [[development_and_impact_of_cdma_technology | CDMA technology]].

Linkabit grew by bringing in other professors and graduate students, forming a team of experts in information theory and wireless signal processing, predominantly for [[analysis_of_modern_defense_contracting | defense contracting]] and satellite work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. By 1971, the company's growth led Jacobs to take a sabbatical from UCSD to organize Linkabit, a sabbatical from which he never returned to academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

During this period, Jacobs and Viterbi realized that while they were doing the critical engineering work, prime [[analysis_of_modern_defense_contracting | defense contractors]] were garnering most of the profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This insight led them to decide to bid on contracts themselves, transitioning Linkabit into a "product-like, contract-focused services company" rather than just a sub-consultant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Recognizing that competing directly with established primes like Raytheon, [[lockheed_martins_role_in_the_militaryindustrial_complex | Lockheed]], and Boeing would be challenging in the defense sector, they decided to explore the commercial sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Pioneering Commercial Satellite Networks

Linkabit's first major commercial project showcased their expertise in satellite communications in a groundbreaking way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. They secured a contract to build the satellite communication system for Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This pioneering effort enabled Walmart's eccentric founder, Sam Walton, to broadcast messages daily from HQ to all local stores and allowed the company to tabulate store data efficiently when internet bandwidth was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

This [[historical_collaboration_with_walmart_satellite_network | collaboration with Walmart]] exemplified Linkabit's ability to apply advanced defense-derived [[the_evolution_and_potential_of_defense_technology | technology]] to commercial needs, demonstrating a crucial shift in [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_venture_capital_and_startups | technological innovation]] and [[challenges_of_building_new_technologies | commercialization]] within the nascent digital communications landscape.

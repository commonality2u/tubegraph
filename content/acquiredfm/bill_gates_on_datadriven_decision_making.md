In the year 2000, the largest sector within software was databases, accounting for roughly a trillion dollars in market capitalization from companies primarily deriving their revenue from this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Looking forward, the volume of data produced annually now surpasses all data generated in human history combined, necessitating a clear home for this ever-growing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Bill Gates's Vision for Decision Making

[[Bill Gates and Windows development history | Bill Gates]] once responded to a question from Meg Whitman, who asked if "all the interesting stuff" had already been done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His reply highlighted the primitive nature of human decision-making: "Do you realize how barbaric it is the way we make decisions?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

[[Bill Gates and Windows development history | Bill Gates]] envisioned a future where decisions would be significantly improved through data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>:
*   All data would be stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Machines would analyze this data to assist in making better [[strategic_decisions_and_leadership_in_technology_companies | decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

He provided examples of how this would transform various fields:
*   Diagnosing illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Educating a dyslexic child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Maintaining an aircraft's engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

Ultimately, [[Bill Gates and Windows development history | Bill Gates]] predicted that "all decisions" would be "made by machines looking at data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Impact on the Database Market
This perspective supported the view that the entire database market would undergo a complete transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The belief was that databases would be remade specifically for the cloud, becoming purpose-built for that environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Consequently, focusing on the cloud infrastructure layer and the enablement required for enterprises to transition to the cloud became a significant area of investment and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

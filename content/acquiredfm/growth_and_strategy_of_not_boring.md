Not Boring is a rapidly growing newsletter, media, and investment entity run by Packy McCormick, which has expanded into what is described as a "media and investment empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. It stands out as the number one business newsletter on Substack, and if it switched to the technology category, it would likely be number one there as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. The venture is notable for its explosive growth and Packy's distinct personal flair, written in a whimsical voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>.

## Early Life and Career Path

Packy McCormick was born on January 26, 1987, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. Early signs of his future endeavors included making small books and newspapers on Post-it notes as a child, inspired by his father's work with the Miami Herald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:14">[10:14:14]</a>. He also enjoyed writing compositions and essays in middle school, often trying to make them funny while still well-researched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:17">[11:17:17]</a>. His work ethic largely stemmed from his parents, both of whom were entrepreneurial and had strong work ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:40">[13:40:40]</a>.

After graduating from Duke University in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:13">[17:52:13]</a>, McCormick secured an investment banking job in public finance at Bank of America, a challenging feat during the recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. While in finance, he also started a company called Throgo, a party bus service from New York to the Jersey Shore and the Hamptons, which paid for his summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:53">[22:20:53]</a>. He left finance after realizing he wasn't passionate about it, aiming for business school as a way out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

Instead of attending business school, McCormick joined Breather, a company that rented out small meeting and workspace rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:50">[29:27:50]</a>. As the first U.S. employee, he was responsible for convincing landlords to rent spaces and then figuring out how to clean and maintain them, even cleaning some himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. This operational experience was far from glamorous, but it provided invaluable hands-on startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>.

During his time at Breather, the company faced significant challenges due to over-expansion and negative gross margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>. McCormick and Ben Rollard, head of data science, developed a detailed strategy to turn the company around by adding monthly space rentals and competing differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50:00">[37:50:00]</a>. This experience highlighted the importance of strategy and deeply influenced McCormick's later writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>. He eventually left Breather in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:57:00">[40:57:00]</a>.

## The Birth of Not Boring

After leaving Breather, McCormick initially pursued two concurrent projects: an email newsletter called "Per My Last Email" and "The Not Boring Club," an in-person social club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:14:00">[42:14:00]</a>. The newsletter started as an assignment from a writing course to gather 20 subscribers, evolving into a link roundup and occasional essays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. The Not Boring Club was conceived as a blend of Soho House and college extracurriculars, aiming to foster community around shared passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic quickly halted the in-person club's activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:37:00">[47:37:00]</a>. In April 2020, with a pregnant wife and no job, McCormick faced a pivotal moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>. His mother suggested applying the "Not Boring Club" name to the newsletter, leading to the rebranding of the email newsletter to Not Boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:48:00">[54:48:00]</a>.

## Growth and Monetization Strategy

Not Boring's early [[Product excellence and innovation as growth drivers | growth]] was fueled by a commitment to quality content and transparency. McCormick decided to focus on writing essays that mixed business strategy with pop culture, an approach he later refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:31:00">[55:31:00]</a>. He initially resisted turning on paid subscriptions, prioritizing audience growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:44:00">[57:44:00]</a>. This decision was partly influenced by the addictive nature of seeing subscriber numbers rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a> and the belief that a broad audience with diverse interests would struggle with a company-paid subscription model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.

Monetization shifted towards sponsored deep dives, a format suggested by Nick Abazid of Main Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. McCormick's approach to sponsored content involved strict adherence to high standards:
*   **Transparency:** Clearly stating that content is sponsored and providing context on the sponsorship model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.
*   **Bullish on Subject:** Only writing about companies he genuinely believes in and would consider investing in personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.
*   **Quality & Depth:** Treating sponsored pieces with the same rigor and research as regular content, aiming to produce the "best thing that's been written" on the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
*   **Optimism:** Maintaining an optimistic tone about technology and startups, contrasting with much of traditional tech journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

This unique model, combining a personal, optimistic voice with in-depth analysis and explicit sponsorship, proved highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. By late 2020, Not Boring had secured enough sponsorships to operate sustainably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>. In February 2021, McCormick publicly aimed for Not Boring to generate $1 million in revenue that year, a goal he ultimately achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>.

## [[Not Boring Capital and venture investing | Not Boring Capital]]

[[Not Boring Capital and venture investing | Not Boring Capital]] emerged as a natural extension of the Not Boring newsletter. Initially, McCormick facilitated syndicate investments for friends' companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:29">[01:56:29]</a>. This evolved into a fund due to the pain of writing memos for every deal and the need for faster decision-making for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-0t="1:56:40">[1:56:40]</a>.

The fund's strategy leverages the newsletter's audience and content in several ways:
*   **Sourcing and Deal Flow:** The newsletter serves as a powerful sourcing tool, with founders reaching out because they are already familiar with McCormick's work and philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:35">[01:57:35]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** McCormick is transparent about his investment process, admitting to less traditional diligence than larger firms but relying on the lead investor's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Value-Add:** His deep dives and strategic insights provide value to portfolio companies, beyond just capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:51">[01:55:51]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Construction:** The strategy allows for a large number of investments (91 in Fund I), aiming to maximize winners rather than preventing zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:55">[02:03:55]</a>.

[[Not Boring Capital and venture investing | Not Boring Capital]]'s operation is heavily enabled by platforms like AngelList, which provides a sophisticated back office and operational support, making it possible for McCormick to manage a fund as a single individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>. This represents a "reorganization of the value chain" in venture capital, dismantling the need for large, vertically integrated firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>.

## Challenges and Trade-offs of the "One-Person Corporation"

Despite its successes, the "one-person corporation" model of Not Boring presents unique challenges and trade-offs:
*   **Reliance on Packy:** The business is highly dependent on McCormick's personal output and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:31">[02:14:31]</a>. If he stops writing, the momentum could slow significantly, as there's no backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:52">[02:14:52]</a>.
*   **Limited Scalability:** While effective, scaling beyond content creation into developing other products or services is difficult without diluting the core offering or requiring significant time investment in hiring and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:02">[02:16:02]</a>.
*   **"Product is You" Dynamic:** McCormick is the product, meaning his personal brand and direct engagement are crucial. This offers high visibility but makes it harder to build an organization that can operate independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>.
*   **Risk of "Greed":** A key principle for McCormick is "don't get greedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>. Over-monetization, lowering content quality, or trying to expand too broadly could alienate the audience and jeopardize the entire model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:13">[02:56:13]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Philosophy

McCormick embraces an "unabashedly optimistic" stance, especially regarding technology and Web3, contrasting with prevalent cynicism in tech journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. His approach to Web3 content is to make complex topics approachable and non-dismissive, focusing on fundamental business principles rather than hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>. He aims to explain what the technology *can* do and why it might work, converting skeptics to thoughtful consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:22">[01:42:22]</a>.

The "[[Strategic decisions for podcast growth and interviews | Not Boring Flywheel]]" centers on the audience, which feeds into founders and sponsors, with the long-form "Monday pieces" driving audience growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:09">[02:32:09]</a>. The core strength lies in the alignment between the content, the audience, and the investment activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:59">[02:33:59]</a>.

### Strategic Powers

Applying Hamilton Helmer's "Seven Powers" framework to Not Boring reveals several key strengths:

*   **Counter-Positioning:** Not Boring demonstrates [[Market strategy and business growth through Windows 95 | counter-positioning]] relative to traditional media companies and venture capital firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:30">[02:40:30]</a>. Its explicit sponsorship model and lack of a traditional journalistic "wall" allows for deeper, more direct engagement with companies, which traditional outlets cannot easily replicate without compromising their established principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>. Similarly, [[Not Boring Capital and venture investing | Not Boring Capital]]'s lean, platform-enabled structure [[Capitalefficient growth strategies in technology companies | contrasts]] with the overhead and partnership models of traditional VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>.
*   **Network Economies (Weak):** While not at the scale of a Facebook, there is a benefit to the growing audience size. As more relevant people read Not Boring, its value to founders seeking investment and companies seeking sponsorship increases, creating a subtle positive feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:45">[02:40:45]</a>.
*   **Process Power:** McCormick's unique creative process for generating content is difficult to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:18">[02:43:18]</a>. The blend of humor, deep research, and optimistic framing is highly personal and cannot be easily formalized into a scalable playbook or style guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:58">[02:42:58]</a>. This idiosyncratic process ensures distinctiveness and quality, but also limits traditional organizational scaling.

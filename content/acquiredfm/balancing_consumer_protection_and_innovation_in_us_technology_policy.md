US Congressman Anthony Gonzalez discusses the intricate balance between fostering innovation and ensuring consumer protection within the realm of technology policy, drawing parallels from his experiences in Congress and his background in the tech industry and athletics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.

## Web3 and Crypto Regulation: A Case Study

Crypto and Web3 became a significant topic in Congress around 2020, particularly during the pandemic when markets saw rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Gonzalez's personal "aha moment" with the space came from listening to a podcast about Flamingo DAO, which made him realize the potential for significant societal impact and solutions to issues in the internet and capital markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

To gain a practical understanding of crypto, Gonzalez engaged with DeFi (Decentralized Finance) using a small margin of personal funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. He emphasized that this hands-on experience was crucial for knowledgeable legislation, comparing it to regulating cell phone companies without ever using a cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. He ensured there was no conflict of interest by donating any proceeds from his experiments to the United Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.

### "Do No Harm" Approach

Gonzalez advocates for a "do no harm" approach to crypto regulation, similar to how the Clinton administration handled the early internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. This philosophy allows new technologies to "breathe" and develop before comprehensive regulation is imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. While acknowledging that bad actors exist in crypto (e.g., tax evasion), he stresses that the response should not be to "destroy the entire industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.

The goal of regulation should be twofold:
1.  **Consumer Protection:** Ensuring the safety and reliability of financial products for everyday citizens, particularly with payment mechanisms like stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.
2.  **Innovation and Clarity:** Providing a clear regulatory environment so that innovators can build transformative products and services without fear of inadvertently breaking laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.

Gonzalez notes that the current regulatory uncertainty discourages companies like FTX, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried (who grew up near Stanford), from operating in the U.S., which is not in America's best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>.

### Legislative Process and Challenges

The legislative process for complex issues like crypto begins with committees holding in-depth hearings to understand various aspects of the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. Gonzalez emphasizes that the best legislation is durable, requiring bipartisan and bicameral support (House and Senate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.

However, the process can be chaotic and frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. An example of this is the "Christmas tree" phenomenon, where unrelated provisions (like a crypto tax provision) are attached to larger bills, such as the infrastructure bill, often without full understanding or prior debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This particular provision, if broadly interpreted, could have labeled any developer working in crypto as a broker, potentially "killing the industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.

### Focus on Stablecoins

Gonzalez predicts that the initial "bite-sized" regulation in crypto will focus on stablecoins, especially after the Terra Luna crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>. This event highlighted the distinction between fiat-backed stablecoins and algorithmic stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

> "My preference would be that we're silent on algorithmic stable coins and you know we'll figure out what exactly that is later...I would say let's focus on fiat back stable coins because I think we all actually agree on that and intellectually that's not that difficult." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>

Regulating fiat-backed stablecoins involves defining reserve qualities, auditing requirements, attestations, and consumer protection measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. This approach allows for the benefits of instant settlement and lower fees while ensuring stability, which is crucial as stablecoins are increasingly used for payments and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.

## Broader US Industrial Policy and Global Competitiveness

Gonzalez’s views on industrial policy are shaped by his family’s background in the steel industry in northeast Ohio, witnessing the decline of the industrial base and its impact on communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.

He emphasizes three key aspects for the U.S. economy:
1.  **Sustainable:** Addresses environmental concerns and long-term viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>.
2.  **Dynamic:** The U.S. should lead in "every critical technology from now until eternity," from AI to future innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:30">[01:40:30]</a>. This is where economic value and jobs are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>.
3.  **Resilient:** The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the risks of over-optimizing for efficiency at the expense of supply chain resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:18">[01:41:18]</a>. While not advocating for reshoring everything, critical technologies and supply chains should be domestic or with trusted allies, especially in the context of competition with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>.

Gonzalez notes the dilemma between sustainability and cost in manufacturing (e.g., steel production) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:38">[01:43:38]</a>. He believes the solution lies in government-funded R&D to invent technologies that make green alternatives so cheap and reliable that they become globally preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>.

> "Our responsibility again at the governmental level is to make sure we're funding that R&D so that we get there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:31">[01:46:31]</a>

### Innovation and R&D

Gonzalez strongly believes that government-scale investment is crucial for significant technological advancements, citing the example of [[technological_and_geopolitical_issues_facing_tsmc_and_the_semiconductor_industry | TSMC]] which was a government-seeded company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>. He supports initiatives like the CHIPS Act, aimed at reshoring semiconductor manufacturing to the U.S. through subsidies and grants, noting Intel's significant investment in Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>.

### Regional Economic Development

Gonzalez emphasizes leveraging existing assets for regional economic growth. He points to Columbus, Ohio, developing a tech scene, particularly in software and insurance, aided by firms like Drive Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. He also highlights northeast Ohio's medical innovation hubs like the Cleveland Clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">[01:50:04]</a>.

## Lessons from College Athletics: Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL)

Gonzalez draws a parallel to the balancing act in college athletics with the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. He felt it was illogical that college athletes were historically the only people in America unable to profit from their NIL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. The NCAA's previous rules, which prevented athletes like a Stanford swimmer from teaching lessons to pay for school, created market distortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

The Supreme Court case that led the NCAA to legalize NIL, but without enforcement, created a "Wild West" situation where collectives of boosters are effectively "buying" players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>. This model, which lacks transparency (e.g., on agent commissions) and handicaps coaches, is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:59">[01:22:59]</a>.

Gonzalez argues that if college athletics become fully professional, many non-revenue-generating sports would likely be cut, reducing opportunities for athletes from diverse backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:19">[01:24:19]</a>. He advocates for a national NIL standard that provides economic rights for athletes while building guardrails around inducements and recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. This balances the athletes' right to monetize their image with the broader structure and opportunities provided by college sports.

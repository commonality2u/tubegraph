Nike's business model is a prominent case study in the importance of great marketing and product, particularly concerning their profound advertisements and sponsorship deals with athletes and teams, which contribute to their best-in-the-world brand positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Early Influence of Athletes

From its inception, the company's approach to athletics involved leveraging athletes. Co-founder Bill Bowerman, as head track coach at the University of Oregon, taught himself to be a cobbler, modifying athletic shoes and using his athletes, including Phil Knight, as "guinea pigs" to gain an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Knight envisioned getting Bowerman to endorse or use the imported "Tiger" shoes as a marketing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. At this time, even a prestigious program like the University of Oregon had to purchase all its shoes, as sponsorships providing free gear were not common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

Bowerman's influence extended beyond direct shoe modification. His book, "Jogging: A Physical Fitness Program for All Ages," and a subsequent *Life Magazine* profile, are credited with initiating the fitness movement in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>. This coincided with Blue Ribbon Sports (later Nike) establishing sufficient distribution to get shoes onto people's feet, aligning with a broader trend of physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. Phil Knight acknowledged that Nike "was at least right there and we sure rode it for one hell of a ride" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.

The company's early marketing playbook was further shaped by its relationship with athletes like Steve Prefontaine. Prefontaine, a "generational runner" coached by Bowerman, simultaneously held every American record for distances between two thousand and ten thousand meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:03">[01:36:03]</a>. Due to amateur athletic union (AAU) rules prohibiting paid endorsements, Nike employed Prefontaine as their "national director of public affairs" for $5,000 a year with "no responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>. Phil Knight famously described his job as "he can run fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>. This strategy, effectively inventing sports marketing as it is known today, embodied an early company principle: "Perfect results count, not a perfect process. Break the rules, fight the law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:45">[01:38:45]</a>.

## Rob Strasser and the Expansion of Sports Marketing

Rob Strasser, who joined Nike's orbit after the company's legal battles with Onitsuka settled in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:30">[01:49:30]</a>, became Nike's first head of marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Strasser systematically expanded the company's sports marketing efforts.

### Individual Athlete Sponsorships

Strasser's first official athlete sponsorship was with tennis player Ilie Nastase for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:02">[01:51:02]</a>. He then began negotiating with athletes and agents, famously signing "half the NBA for peanuts," primarily journeymen and role players, providing them with free shoes in exchange for visibility on nationally televised broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>.

### College Sports Program

Strasser hired Sonny Vaccaro to build Nike's college basketball program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>. This involved signing up coaches from major basketball schools to be "Nike coaches," allowing them to be paid as consultants and advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:10">[01:52:10]</a>. Within a month, top programs like UNLV, Georgetown, Texas, and Arkansas, as well as legendary Coach Jimmy V at Iona, committed to being Nike coaches and having their teams wear Nike products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:43">[01:52:43]</a>. A notable anecdote involves Coach Lefty Driesell of Maryland signing with Nike after seeing an article about their college program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:20">[01:53:20]</a>. The Washington Post ran a "pearl clutchy" article criticizing Nike for "commercializing the purity of college athletics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:04">[01:53:04]</a>. Mistakenly including Iowa in the article, Coach Lute Olson of Iowa (later Arizona) called Nike to inquire about participating, leading to his signing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:30">[01:53:30]</a>. This playbook was then applied to college football, signing big coaches and schools for minimal cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>.

These endorsement deals were not primarily about selling the specific shoes worn by athletes, but about cementing the Nike brand as what "real athletes wear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:17">[01:54:17]</a>. The goal was to generate "brand impressions" and establish Nike as a company that athletes choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:38">[01:55:38]</a>. Phil Knight's philosophy was to "imagine great athletes as he imagined them, as having implications of the very best that the human spirit had to offer," turning them into modern heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:20">[04:00:20]</a>. Rob Strasser articulated this as, "Individual athletes, even more than teams, will be the heroes, symbols more and more of what real people can't do anymore: risk and win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:57">[03:59:57]</a>. This strategy aligns with the idea of athletes as "Netflix shows," where their lives and performances provide constant, compelling content for brand visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:21">[03:39:21]</a>.

## The Michael Jordan Deal: A Turning Point

By 1984, Nike faced challenges, having mistaken the running boom for the broader fitness boom, which led to competitors like Reebok (which later ended up with Adidas) eclipsing them in sales by focusing on aerobics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>. In this critical period, Michael Jordan signed with Nike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:40">[02:14:40]</a>.

The Jordan deal was revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:05">[02:17:05]</a>. While Magic Johnson and Larry Bird had contracts with Converse for around $100,000 a year to wear existing shoes, Nike offered Jordan a "signature shoe" and a participation in its upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:50]</a>. The deal guaranteed a minimum $2.5 million payout over five years, but the truly innovative aspect was a 5% royalty on gross revenue from all sales of Air Jordans and associated merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:57">[02:17:57]</a>. Additionally, Jordan received a royalty on incremental sales in the broader Nike basketball line beyond a baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:09">[02:20:09]</a>. Nike also guaranteed minimum advertising spend for the Jordan line and gave him stock options in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:54">[02:20:54]</a>.

Jordan initially preferred Adidas, but they were unwilling to match Nike's offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>. In its first year, the Air Jordan 1 line sold $126 million, far exceeding the goal of $3 million over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This meant Jordan earned $6.3 million in his first year from Nike, equivalent to his entire seven-year contract with the Chicago Bulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:12">[02:24:12]</a>.

The initial success was partly due to Nike's shrewd marketing of a controversy. Jordan wore black and red shoes (Air Ships, precursors to Air Jordan 1s) in preseason, which the NBA deemed against league policy. The league threatened fines, prompting Nike to create a commercial highlighting the "banned" status of the shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>. This made the shoes highly desirable to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:50">[02:29:50]</a>.

Despite an initial "channel stuffing" in the first year and issues with the Air Jordan 2, Jordan renegotiated his deal with Nike after his ally Rob Strasser left the company to join Adidas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:06">[02:37:06]</a>. Nike tasked designer Tinker Hatfield with creating the Air Jordan 3 based on Jordan's specific preferences, which included soft leather, a mid-cut height, elephant print, and notably, minimal Swoosh branding, instead prominently featuring the "Jumpman" logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:46">[02:39:46]</a>. This established the Jordan brand as its own sub-segment within Nike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:26">[02:42:26]</a>. The deal extended for seven more years with an increased guarantee to $18 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:04">[02:43:04]</a>. Jordan earned at least $100 million over this contract, vastly exceeding his NBA earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:51">[02:43:51]</a>.

## Continued Impact and Evolution of Endorsements

The rise of the Jordan brand coincided with the growth of media outlets like ESPN's SportsCenter, providing constant visibility for athletes and the Nike brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:26">[02:47:26]</a>. This allowed Nike to launch campaigns like "Just Do It" in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:01">[02:48:01]</a>. The Jordan brand has continued to grow, reaching $6.6 billion in revenue in FY22, earning Michael Jordan over $300 million annually in royalties, two decades after his retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:25">[02:45:25]</a>. This has solidified his status as a "founder of a brand" rather than just a sponsored athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:59">[02:45:59]</a>.

Nike's strategy has also involved high-profile social stances through its endorsements. The 2018 "Dream Crazy" campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, with the text "Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything," was a significant risk at the time, launched two years before broader public awareness of Black Lives Matter issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:01">[03:02:01]</a>. This campaign entirely changed Nike's media plan, demonstrating their willingness to take a stand on social issues and align with specific values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

Nike consistently focuses on athletes rather than celebrities, a distinction highlighted by Adidas's disastrous partnership with Kanye West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:27">[03:46:27]</a>. Nike declined to give Kanye creative control, prioritizing its athlete-centric brand identity over a celebrity endorsement that could potentially dilute its image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:50">[03:46:50]</a>. This decision proved beneficial, as Adidas's net income significantly declined due to the Yeezy write-down after ending their partnership with Kanye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:42">[03:47:42]</a>.

Nike has a near monopoly in basketball shoes, holding 86% of the performance basketball market and 96% of the lifestyle basketball category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:05">[03:26:05]</a>. They also serve as the official uniform supplier for the MLB, NFL, and NBA, with deals like the NFL contract being worth around $200 million a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:31">[03:37:31]</a>. For the NBA, Nike pays to make the jerseys worn by players, which are primarily a "billboard" for the brand, as replica jerseys for fans are often made and sold by companies like Fanatics, but still feature the Nike Swoosh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:03">[03:28:03]</a>. This shows a strategy where brand visibility is paramount, even if it means not directly monetizing every product sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:04">[03:29:04]</a>.

## Financial Implications

Nike's focus on athlete endorsements and marketing is reflected in its financial statements. The company spends $4 billion annually on "demand creation," which primarily constitutes their sports marketing budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:04">[03:24:04]</a>. This investment, akin to Netflix producing content, aims to generate demand for their products and build a powerful brand narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:27">[03:24:27]</a>. Despite having a gross margin profile of 44% (lower than luxury brands like LVMH at 68% or Hermès at 71%), Nike prioritizes growth and widespread brand presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:16">[03:22:16]</a>. They intentionally price limited-edition sneakers at accessible points (e.g., $150-$300) even if they command significantly higher prices in the secondary market, enabling a broader audience to participate in the "dream" and keeping the brand attainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>. This strategy allows Nike to generate volume sales, unlike luxury brands that focus on high margins per item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:26">[03:22:26]</a>.

Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, emerged from humble beginnings to become the world's most valuable company, revolutionizing the software industry and personal computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

## Early Life and Influences

Born William Henry Gates III (known as Trey) in Seattle, Washington, in 1955, Bill Gates was the second of three children to Bill and Mary Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. His father, Bill Gates Senior, grew up in Bremerton, Washington, in a family that owned a furniture store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. After serving in World War II, Bill Gates Senior was the first in his family to attend college, earning both an undergraduate and law degree from the University of Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. He became a prominent attorney and co-founding partner of Preston Gates and Ellis, now known as K&L Gates, one of the world's largest law firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. He also later joined the board of Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

Bill's mother, Mary Maxwell, came from a successful business family that founded National City Bank, and her father was a senior executive at First Interstate Bank (later part of Wells Fargo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Mary was a powerful figure in the Pacific Northwest business community, serving on numerous nonprofit boards including the Seattle Junior League, Seattle Symphony, Chamber of Commerce, Children's Hospital, King County United Way, and eventually the national United Way board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. She also joined corporate boards such as First Interstate Bank, KIRO Television, and Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

Growing up, Bill Gates' household was unique, often hosting CEOs, senators, or governors for dinner, allowing him to absorb business conversations from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. At age 13, he already pondered which company he would lead in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. Gates was also intensely competitive, disliking losing at anything, whether sports, school, or computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. His childhood friend and future co-founder, Paul Allen, noted three things about Bill Gates: "He was really smart. He was really competitive. He wanted to show you how smart he was. And he was really, really persistent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

## The Lakeside School and Early Computing

In seventh grade, Bill Gates' parents enrolled him at Lakeside School, a rigorous college preparatory school in Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. Here, at age 13, he was exposed to computing when the Lakeside Mother's Club raised money to buy a teletype and rent time on a DEC PDP-10 mainframe in downtown Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. In 1968, computers were either massive room-sized machines or human calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. Gates quickly taught himself to program and, with three other kids, including Paul Allen, formed the "Lakeside Programmers Group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>. Their goal was to use their rare programming skills to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.

The group was hired by Computer Center Corporation (C-Cubed), a local University of Washington startup that aimed to be a computer time-sharing company, akin to a pre-AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:05]</a>. They were paid in computer time to find and document bugs in C-Cubed's system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. At C-Cubed, they learned advanced programming languages like Fortran, Lisp, and machine language for PDPs, beyond the Basic they used at Lakeside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>. They were mentored by Steve Russell, the creator of the first video game, Space War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>.

Later, for another time-sharing company in Portland, Bill negotiated a royalty deal, not an hourly wage, for developing a payroll billing program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>. This venture earned them at least $10,000, exceeding the average U.S. household income at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>.

## Traf-O-Data and the Microprocessor Vision

After high school, Paul Allen and Bill Gates teamed up on a new venture called Traf-O-Data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>. Their business plan was to build a machine using Intel's new microprocessor (the 8008) to process and analyze traffic data for municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:00">[26:42:00]</a>. Paul Allen wrote an emulator program on a PDP-10 at Washington State to mimic the 8008's instruction set, allowing them to code before having access to the physical chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>. This early experience with microprocessors planted the seeds for Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>.

Paul Allen's insight into exponential improvements in semiconductors, akin to Moore's Law, deeply impacted Gates. Gates initially found the idea of "exponential phenomena" rare, but once convinced, he realized it meant "computing as free," enabling new possibilities no one had imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>. This moment was the genesis of Microsoft's famous vision: "A computer on every desk and in every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[31:53:00]</a>. At the time, this vision was considered "whackadoo stuff" by many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>.

## The Altair 8800 and the Founding of Microsoft

In 1973, Bill Gates began college at Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:24:00">[33:24:00]</a>. While there, he befriended Steve Ballmer, who would later become a key figure at Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>. Ballmer, while not a programmer, was a brilliant mathematician and highly analytical, a contrast to Gates' more reserved demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a>.

In December 1974, Paul Allen saw the January issue of Popular Electronics magazine, featuring the Altair 8800 on its cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:36:00">[37:36:00]</a>. The Altair 8800, manufactured by Mits, was the world's first commercially available microcomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>. Paul immediately ran to Bill, exclaiming, "It's here!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>. Bill's reaction was, "Oh my God, it's happening without us!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>.

Despite not having a single line of code written, Bill and Paul called Mits president Ed Roberts and falsely claimed to have a Basic interpreter ready for the Altair 8800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47:00">[41:47:00]</a>. Roberts, who was trying to save his bankrupt model rocketry company through this new computer, offered a contract to anyone who could demonstrate a working Basic interpreter in his Albuquerque office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:31:00">[42:31:00]</a>.

The Altair, priced at $397 ($300 in 2024 dollars), was revolutionary, as the next cheapest computer was a $120,000 mini-computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:24:00">[48:24:00]</a>. Mits achieved this price point due to Ed Roberts' deal with Intel for 8080 chips at $75 each, significantly below the $360 list price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:14:00">[49:14:00]</a>.

Working furiously, Paul Allen wrote an 8080 emulator on a Harvard PDP-10, while Bill Gates wrote the Basic interpreter against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:26:00">[44:26:00]</a>. Paul flew to Albuquerque with the code, hand-coding the bootloader in octal on the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:00">[45:34:00]</a>. After one failed attempt, the Basic interpreter successfully loaded on the Altair, and when Paul typed "print 2 plus 2," it responded with "4," astonishing both him and Roberts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:07:00">[46:07:00]</a>.

Paul Allen moved to Albuquerque and joined Mits as Vice President of Software, while Bill Gates stayed at Harvard, continuing to enhance the Basic interpreter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:00">[51:42:00]</a>. On April 4, 1975, they officially founded "Micro-Soft" as a two-person partnership, with Bill owning 60% and Paul 40% (later adjusted to 64%/36% to reflect Bill's higher dedication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>. The name, suggested by Paul, combined "microcomputer" and "software," serving as a clear North Star for their focus on software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51:00">[52:51:00]</a>.

## Early Business Model and Piracy

Micro-Soft signed an exclusive licensing arrangement with Mits for their Basic interpreter for the 8080 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[53:30:00]</a>. The terms included $30 per copy sold by Mits, plus 50% of sub-licensing revenue from other companies, capped at $180,000 lifetime revenue for Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:22:00">[55:22:00]</a>. Crucially, the contract included a clause (likely influenced by Bill Gates Senior) requiring Mits to use "best efforts" to promote and commercialize Basic broadly, with failure being grounds for termination by Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:56:00">[56:56:00]</a>.

Despite the Altair's success (4,000 pre-orders in the first month), Microsoft's revenue remained low ($16,000 in 1975, $22,000 in 1976) because people were pirating the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:28:00">[57:28:00]</a>. This highlighted a fundamental problem: software was being sold for the first time, and the legal framework for copyright protection was not yet established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. It wasn't until 1980 that Congress amended copyright law to include "computer program" as a protectable creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

Gates realized the flaw in their business model: customers were buying the hardware but pirating the software, and Mits had misaligned incentives, often refusing to sublicense Basic to other companies to avoid competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. He understood that software should be included by the hardware OEM as part of the total purchase price, shifting to a royalty model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.

## Breaking Free and Going Global

In 1977, the personal computer market exploded with the "1977 Trinity": the RadioShack TRS-80, the Commodore PET, and the Apple II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>. These machines were fully assembled, low-cost, and had major distribution advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

Unbeknownst to Bill and Paul, Mits was about to be acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. In May 1977, Mits was acquired by Pertec for $6.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. Pertec tried to dismiss Bill Gates, who was only 21, but Roberts famously compared their underestimation of Gates to "Roosevelt telling Churchill that he could deal with Stalin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.

In November 1977, Microsoft won an arbitration case against Mits/Pertec, freeing them to license Basic to anyone on their own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. They immediately licensed it to Apple, Commodore, RadioShack, and other large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>. The deal with Apple, for instance, was $31,000 for eight years of access to Microsoft's Basic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

Bill Gates' strategy was to make it a "no-brainer" for every microcomputer seller to use Microsoft's Basic, thereby setting the industry standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. This established a "positive spiral" where a slight advantage would compound, making Microsoft the dominant programming environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. Because Bill and Paul's overhead was incredibly low (five employees by the end of 1977), they could afford to offer such low-priced deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.

This strategic shift led to booming revenue, with Microsoft reaching $381,000 in 1977 despite the prior dispute, then $1.3 million in 1978, and $2.4 million in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.

In 1978, Microsoft began its international expansion, with half of its revenue coming from Japan by 1979, thanks to a partnership with Japanese computer enthusiast Kazuhiko Nishi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>. This early global presence became a cornerstone of Microsoft's long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.

## The Move to Seattle and the IBM PC Partnership

By the end of 1979, with 25 employees, Microsoft decided to move from Albuquerque to Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. Bill Gates cited reasons like wanting to return home, avoiding the "rumor mill" and high employee turnover of Silicon Valley, and leveraging the talent pool from the University of Washington's computer science department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.

The year 1980 was pivotal for Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. Steve Ballmer officially joined Microsoft in June 1980 as employee number 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a>. Ballmer was the first person outside of Bill Gates and Paul Allen to receive equity in the company, getting 8.5% through a handshake deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[01:35:52]</a>.

At this time, IBM, the world's most valuable company with a market cap of $34 billion in 1980, recognized the exploding microcomputer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>. Having missed the mini-computer era to DEC, IBM aimed to enter the personal computing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:19">[01:30:19]</a>. They formed a secret "Skunk Works" division in Boca Raton, Florida, called Project Chess, with the ambitious goal of shipping an IBM microcomputer (PC) within a year, using entirely off-the-shelf components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.

IBM approached Microsoft in August 1980 for programming languages for their new PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:07">[01:35:07]</a>. While Microsoft did not have an operating system at the time, Bill Gates initially referred IBM to Gary Kildall's Digital Research, which made the CP/M operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>. However, the meeting between IBM and Digital Research ended in a "business blunder," possibly due to Kildall's absence (he was reportedly flying his plane) or disagreements over high royalty demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>.

With Digital Research out of the picture, IBM returned to Microsoft, throwing the problem back to them to source an operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Microsoft then acquired the rights to QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), a 16-bit operating system for the Intel 8086, from Seattle Computer Products for $25,000, later paying an additional $50,000 for full ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>. QDOS was developed by Tim Patterson, who subsequently joined Microsoft and helped evolve it into MS-DOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>. This $75,000 acquisition would eventually generate billions of dollars for Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:31">[01:46:31]</a>.

## [[microsofts_partnership_with_ibm_and_development_of_msdos | The IBM PC Partnership and MS-DOS]]

The deal between Microsoft and IBM, signed in November 1980, is considered the "single most important deal ever done in the history of technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>. IBM paid Microsoft a fixed fee of $430,000 for testing, consultation, DOS, and 16-bit language interpreters, with no ongoing per-copy royalties for DOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>. This was a critical point where Bill Gates chose to prioritize market penetration and standardization over immediate profit maximization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">[01:50:04]</a>.

Crucially, Microsoft retained the rights to own DOS and their languages and license them to anyone else they wanted, at any price and on any terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:10">[01:50:10]</a>. IBM's reasoning for this concession was twofold: to avoid antitrust scrutiny (they didn't want to own the software) and an overestimation of their own market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:53">[01:51:53]</a>. They believed that once IBM entered the PC market, they would be the dominant player, and it wouldn't matter who owned the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>. IBM "failed to see the value of software" and certainly failed to understand what a software platform business model would entail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>.

Bill Gates, however, bet that the same dynamics that played out with the Altair would repeat with the IBM PC: there would be a million hardware manufacturers, "flowers blooming," building to the same open specification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:42">[01:52:42]</a>.

The IBM PC shipped in August 1981, just over a year after Project Chess began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>. Within months, it sold 13,500 units, and over the next two years, it sold half a million, making it the undisputed market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>. While IBM offered other operating system choices (CP/M and Pascal), MS-DOS was priced significantly cheaper ($60 compared to $175 for CP/M), incentivizing mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:13">[01:56:13]</a>.

IBM did attempt to create some lock-in with proprietary BIOS, but it was easily reverse-engineered by companies like Compaq, which became the fastest startup to hit $100 million and then $1 billion in revenue by cloning the IBM PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:28">[01:57:28]</a>. Compaq successfully cloned the IBM PC by using two engineers: one dissected the IBM PC BIOS code to document its proprietary calls without writing implementation steps, and the other, without seeing the first engineer's work, independently implemented the required interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:38">[01:58:38]</a>. This led to a "race to the bottom" in PC hardware, with all value accruing to the software layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:56">[02:00:56]</a>.

Microsoft licensed DOS to all these clone companies on a per-machine-sold basis, turning their fixed-fee deal with IBM into a "geyser of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:15">[02:01:15]</a>. By fiscal year 1984, Microsoft's revenue soared from $25 million in 1982 to $98 million, driven by the success of the clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:10">[02:02:10]</a>. Microsoft used IBM to generate demand for their software and then used every other PC manufacturer to capture the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:52">[02:01:52]</a>.

## Microsoft's IPO and Early Applications

In 1981, Microsoft reorganized from a partnership into a C corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Technology Venture Investors (TVI) invested $1 million for 5% of the company, valuing it at $20 million post-money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:13">[02:04:13]</a>. This was the only external dilution Microsoft ever took <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:06">[02:05:06]</a>. Despite its rapid growth and high margins, the market largely undervalued software companies at the time, still viewing hardware (like Apple, valued at $1.8 billion at its IPO in 1980) as the primary source of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:20">[02:05:20]</a>.

When Microsoft went public in 1986, it was valued at only $750 million, despite having $200 million in high-margin software revenue and 100% year-over-year growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:35">[02:05:35]</a>. At IPO, Bill Gates still owned 49% of the company, Paul Allen 28%, and Steve Ballmer 7.5%, a testament to their capital efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>.

### Application Software and Xerox PARC Influence

In the late 1970s, pioneering applications like VisiCalc (the first spreadsheet) and WordStar (a word processor) emerged for 8-bit machines like the Apple II, demonstrating the potential for business applications on personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:56">[02:13:56]</a>. Microsoft established a "consumer products division" to develop its own application software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:38">[02:14:38]</a>.

A key hire for this division was Charles Simonyi, poached from Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>. Xerox PARC was a legendary research center where foundational computing concepts were invented, including the graphical user interface (GUI), the desktop, the mouse, object-oriented programming, Ethernet, and laser printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:37">[02:16:37]</a>. While Apple famously took inspiration from PARC for the Mac, Microsoft similarly integrated many of these concepts, with Simonyi being a primary vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:20">[02:16:20]</a>.

Simonyi led the teams that created Microsoft Word (launched 1983 for DOS, even shipping with a mouse) and Multiplan (Microsoft's first spreadsheet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:20">[02:19:20]</a>. These were initially character-mode DOS applications, as the GUI (outside of PARC's mini-computer based Alto) was not yet mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:44">[02:19:44]</a>.

Microsoft's Multiplan strategy of targeting multiple platforms failed against Lotus 1-2-3, which made the "radical decision" to create a spreadsheet *only* for the IBM PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:21">[02:20:21]</a>. Lotus 1-2-3 became the most successful software ever, even having more revenue than Microsoft the year Microsoft went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:58">[02:20:58]</a>.

Microsoft learned a crucial lesson: "never leave yourself open to the next generation of Technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:57">[02:21:57]</a>. They decided to target the next platform and become the "killer app" on that platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:06">[02:23:06]</a>. This meant focusing on the graphical user interface, which was poised to be instantiated best by Apple's Macintosh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:30">[02:23:30]</a>.

## The Macintosh and Microsoft Office

The first version of Microsoft Excel was developed for the Mac, released in 1985 as the world's first graphical spreadsheet program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>. This was a strategic move to leverage the GUI, as Microsoft could not compete with Lotus 1-2-3 on the command-line IBM PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:23">[02:27:23]</a>.

The Macintosh, launched in 1984, initially struggled due to limited memory (128k) but gained traction with its 512k version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Apple, recognizing Excel and PageMaker as "killer apps," heavily promoted Excel, even matching Microsoft's marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:32">[02:29:32]</a>. Microsoft had been deeply involved in Mac development, with Steve Jobs showing Bill Gates the Mac project in 1981, three years before its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:41">[02:31:41]</a>.

In January 1985, Microsoft released "The Business Pack for Microsoft" on the Mac, later known as [[the_business_strategy_and_corporate_structure_of_microsoft | Microsoft Office]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:47">[02:32:47]</a>. This initial suite included Word, File, Chart, and Multiplan (PowerPoint was acquired later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:07">[02:33:07]</a>. Initially, it was a bundle of separate applications without deep product integration like copy-paste functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:48">[02:33:48]</a>.

## The Rise of Windows and IBM Divorce

Recognizing the future of the GUI, Microsoft announced its own graphical user interface, Windows, in November 1983, before the Mac shipped, much to Apple's displeasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:13">[02:36:13]</a>. [[the_development_and_impact_of_windows_95 | Windows]] development was rocky, with Steve Ballmer even stepping in as development manager for Windows 1.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:38">[02:36:38]</a>.

Windows 1.0, released in November 1985, was "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:43">[02:42:43]</a>. It featured tiled (non-overlapping) windows, dynamic resizing, and was a "half-step" between command-line and a true GUI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Apple had licensed some of its UI intellectual property from Xerox to Microsoft for Windows 1.0, but the agreement's terms included "this and all future versions of Windows," a clause that would later haunt Apple in copyright lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:50">[02:38:50]</a>.

Crucially, early versions of Windows (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1) were not full operating systems but rather "graphical operating environments" that ran on top of MS-DOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. The original name for Windows was "Interface Manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:52">[02:39:52]</a>.

Microsoft's primary strategic bet during this period was not Windows, but rather OS/2, a new, modern operating system developed in partnership with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:52">[02:42:52]</a>. IBM's goal with OS/2 was to regain proprietary control over the PC ecosystem, making OS/2 exclusive to IBM hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:47">[02:42:47]</a>. Microsoft committed to this vision, with Steve Ballmer calling it "riding the bear" – staying with IBM because they were the biggest player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:40">[02:43:40]</a>. This meant downplaying Windows development, which was handled by a small "misfit" team of only 65 people for Windows 3.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:04">[02:52:04]</a>.

IBM, to protect its mainframe business, intentionally chose the less powerful Intel 286 chip for its PC/AT, which was not strong enough for a true GUI or multitasking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:12">[02:45:12]</a>. Bill Gates called the 286 chip "brain dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:34">[02:45:34]</a>. This allowed clone makers like Compaq to leap ahead by using the more powerful 386 chip, running early versions of Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:03">[02:46:03]</a>.

OS/2, released in December 1987, was not well-received by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:23">[02:47:23]</a>. By late 1988, the "divorce" between IBM and Microsoft was impending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:11">[02:48:11]</a>. Microsoft hired Mike Maples, IBM's director of software strategy, to head their application software group, signaling their commitment to the GUI future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:17">[02:48:17]</a>.

In 1990, [[the_development_and_impact_of_windows_95 | Windows 3.0]] was released, marking a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:45">[02:48:45]</a>. It offered a "good true multitasking good UI graphical user interface running on top of DOS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>. Windows 3.0 doubled the penetration of previous versions in six months, and PC Computing magazine declared it the start of a "second era of IBM compatible PCs," allowing them to "soar in a decade of multitasking graphical operating environments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:17">[02:49:17]</a>.

The unexpected success of Windows 3.0 led Microsoft's executives, including Bill and Steve, to officially "bet on Windows" as their new primary strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>. Windows, previously Plan B, became Plan A, driven by user demand for the GUI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a>.

## Dominance and the Enterprise Shift

Microsoft's revenue soared, reaching $1.2 billion in fiscal 1990 (the first software company to pass a billion) and $2.8 billion in fiscal 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:26">[02:54:26]</a>. In 1992, Microsoft won the Apple copyright lawsuit, as the judge found Apple had licensed the UI paradigms for "all future versions of Windows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:01">[02:55:01]</a>. In October 1992, Bill Gates became the wealthiest person in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:20">[02:55:20]</a>. By January 1993, Microsoft surpassed IBM in market cap, inheriting the computing throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:41">[02:55:41]</a>.

With this new dominance, Microsoft embraced its role as a platform steward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:12">[02:57:12]</a>. They focused on making developers successful through API support and documentation, and pushed OEMs to pre-install Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:21">[02:57:21]</a>. From 1988 to 1994, Microsoft implemented a "per-processor licensing fee" with OEMs, where they paid a flat fee for every machine shipped, regardless of whether it included DOS or Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:49">[02:58:49]</a>. While this practice later faced antitrust scrutiny, it incentivized OEMs to only ship Microsoft operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:08">[03:00:08]</a>.

### [[the_business_strategy_and_corporate_structure_of_microsoft | Enterprise Market]] and [[microsofts_strategy_during_the_ballmer_years | Windows NT]]

As PCs became commonplace in businesses, Microsoft recognized the need to sell to the enterprise, a market they initially knew little about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:40">[03:02:40]</a>. Steve Ballmer took on the task of building an enterprise sales and support organization, a significant transformation for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:12">[03:03:12]</a>. This involved building direct and indirect salesforces, customer service, and solutions for CIOs and IT departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:18">[03:05:18]</a>.

The enterprise shift also led to the development of Windows NT. IBM's original goal with OS/2 was to centralize enterprise PC workloads, and after their divorce, Microsoft pursued a similar vision to "eat [IBM's] lunch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>. In October 1988, Microsoft hired Dave Cutler from DEC, a legendary engineer who had written DEC's operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:21">[03:10:21]</a>. Cutler's presence gave Microsoft legitimacy in the enterprise market and paved the way for [[the_rise_of_microsoft_azure_and_its_impact | Windows Server]] and eventually [[the_rise_of_microsoft_azure_and_its_impact | Azure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:08">[03:11:08]</a>. Windows NT was a long-term bet, a power-hungry operating system built for enterprise administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:46">[03:12:46]</a>.

In 1991, Bill Gates articulated Microsoft's strategy: "Windows one evolving architecture, a couple of implementations and an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:21">[03:13:21]</a>. This meant a single API (Win32) for developers to target, with different implementations for consumer (Windows 95) and enterprise (Windows NT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:57">[03:13:57]</a>.

### [[the_development_and_impact_of_windows_95 | Windows 95]] and Consumer PC Heyday

The mid-1990s marked the "heyday of the consumer PC," driven by advancements in graphics cards, PC gaming, CD-ROM technology, and multimedia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:29">[03:15:29]</a>. By 1995, 75 million people were using Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>.

The launch of [[the_development_and_impact_of_windows_95 | Windows 95]] (code-named "Chicago") on August 24, 1995, was an unprecedented event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:05">[03:18:05]</a>. Microsoft set up tents across its Redmond campus, flew in journalists, and hired Jay Leno to co-host the launch with Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:25">[03:18:25]</a>. The company famously licensed "Start Me Up" by The Rolling Stones as the official theme song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:14">[03:19:14]</a>. People lined up worldwide to buy the operating system, and landmarks like the CN Tower and Tower of London were lit up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:49">[03:20:49]</a>. Coca-Cola even contacted Microsoft to learn about their marketing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:03">[03:21:03]</a>.

Windows 95's success was attributed to its intuitive user experience, including the "Start Menu," and its ability to deliver true multitasking and a good graphical user interface for the consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:56">[03:21:56]</a>. Although it still used DOS in some fallback situations, Windows 95 was a largely rewritten, true 32-bit operating system, marking the beginning of Windows as its own OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:07">[03:28:07]</a>.

Windows 95 sold a million copies in the first week and 7 million in the first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:46">[03:26:46]</a>. This propelled Microsoft to $5.9 billion in revenue in fiscal 1995, $8.7 billion in fiscal 1996, and $12 billion in fiscal 1997, making it the first software company to pass $10 billion in revenue and cementing Windows as Microsoft's core franchise product for the next two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:56">[03:26:56]</a>.

## Playbook and Power

Microsoft's journey from its founding to global dominance reveals several key playbooks and sources of power:

*   **Capital Efficiency and Founder Control:** Microsoft was remarkably capital-efficient, bootstrapping its growth and only taking minimal external investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:03">[03:31:03]</a>. This allowed Bill Gates to retain 49% ownership at IPO, giving him unparalleled control over the company's destiny and strategic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:27">[03:32:27]</a>. This was possible due to the "freak laws of nature" at the time: Moore's Law (exponential growth in computing power) and the zero marginal cost of software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:59">[03:34:59]</a>.
*   **Hedging and Adaptability:** Microsoft consistently hedged its bets in an uncertain technological future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:48">[03:40:48]</a>. While they committed to IBM and OS/2, they also nurtured Windows as a Plan B, allowing them to quickly pivot when the market favored the GUI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Platform Shifts:** Microsoft capitalized on new technological generations (e.g., 16-bit microprocessors, GUI) to disrupt incumbents and establish new market positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:04">[03:43:04]</a>. They became the "killer app" on the next platform, even if it meant competing with their own previous products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>.
*   **Talent Magnet and Culture:** Microsoft became a talent magnet, attracting ambitious individuals across engineering, sales, and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. The culture fostered a sense of personal responsibility and a relentless drive to "make great software that follows the principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:15">[03:46:15]</a>.
*   **OEM Strategy and Internationalization:** By licensing software to numerous OEMs, Microsoft achieved massive scale efficiently, similar to [[the_business_strategy_and_corporate_structure_of_microsoft | Visa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:31">[03:46:31]</a>. Their early and sustained commitment to international markets, including significant investment in localization and country-specific sales structures, ensured global adoption and compounded network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **"Software is Never Done"**: Unlike many early competitors who viewed software as a finished product upon shipment, Microsoft embraced the continuous evolution of software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:40">[03:53:40]</a>. They were world-class at learning from customers and integrating feedback into subsequent versions, leading to the saying that Microsoft's third version of a product was typically "pretty good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:02">[03:53:02]</a>.
*   **Copycatting and Usability:** Microsoft was famously not first to market with most of its applications, often "copycatting" ideas with "no shame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:17">[03:50:17]</a>. However, they meticulously made their software easy to switch to, incorporating familiar elements like Lotus 1-2-3 keyboard shortcuts into Excel, which led to better risk-adjusted returns by building on proven market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:49">[03:50:49]</a>.

In terms of Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers:

*   **Counter-positioning:** Microsoft's willingness to embrace a software-only business model and an open hardware ecosystem contrasted sharply with IBM's bundled, proprietary approach, allowing Microsoft to avoid the legacy baggage that hindered IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:11">[03:56:11]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies:** The fixed cost of software development amortized across a massive, growing user base (due to OEM distribution) generated immense profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:46">[03:57:46]</a>.
*   **Switching Costs:** Once users and developers adopted MS-DOS and then Windows, switching to another operating system became extremely difficult due to the lack of compatible applications and the established standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:29">[03:58:29]</a>.
*   **Network Economies:** The growing number of Windows users incentivized more developers to create applications for Windows, which in turn attracted more users, creating powerful feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:07">[03:59:07]</a>. Document formats (e.g., Word, Excel files) also created significant network effects, both within and across organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:31">[03:59:31]</a>.
*   **Branding:** Over time, Microsoft cultivated a powerful brand synonymous with personal computing, leading to trust and preference among consumers and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:15">[03:49:15]</a>.
*   **Cornered Resource:** The talent pool, particularly early engineers like Paul Allen and later Dave Cutler, represented a cornered resource of unique expertise in a nascent industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:37">[03:34:37]</a>.
*   **Process Power:** Microsoft's iterative development cycle and relentless focus on integrating customer feedback enabled them to continuously improve their products and maintain a competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:05">[03:53:05]</a>.

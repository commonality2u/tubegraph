Costco holds an "incredible running room" for international expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. While their core business model, established by founders like Saul Price and Jim Sinegal, focused on extreme value and high-quality products at the lowest possible prices, this approach has proven universally appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:59">[02:01:59]</a>.

## Early International Footholds

Costco's international expansion began early in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>. The company established a presence in Canada and Mexico, setting the stage for more aggressive global growth throughout the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>.

## Expansion into Asian and European Markets

After consolidating its North American presence, Costco began expanding into other key markets:
*   **United Kingdom** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>
*   **Korea** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>
*   **Taiwan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>
*   **Japan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>
*   **China** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a> â€“ This has become a significant initiative for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>.

### Adapting to Diverse Cultures

Entering Asian markets presented unique challenges, as the concept of a huge warehouse with bulk packaging might not seem obvious for cultures like Japan, where people live in tightly packed, dense urban environments with smaller houses and apartments, unlike the land of SUVs and suburbs found in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:30">[01:38:30]</a>. Despite these differences, the model has worked great, proving that high-quality products at a great value are a compelling proposition worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>.

### The Role of Kirkland Signature

The creation of the [[Kirkland Signature]] house brand was directly tied to Costco's international expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>. The company needed a brand name and a trademark that could be cleared across all countries where they operated or planned to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>. The name "Kirkland Signature" (derived from their original corporate headquarters in Kirkland, Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>) worked well in places like Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, despite its generic sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>. Over time, [[Kirkland Signature]] has become synonymous with a certain level of quality and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>.

## China Strategy and Growth

Costco's expansion into China has been particularly notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:45">[02:43:45]</a>. The first store in China, opened in 2019, quickly accumulated 400,000 members within two years, a significant increase compared to the average U.S. store which has 68,000 members at maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:57">[02:43:57]</a>. This demonstrates incredible pent-up demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:49">[02:43:49]</a>.

The company has been deliberate about its China strategy, even obtaining a permit to open their first store 20 years before they actually did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:37">[02:44:37]</a>. Operating in China can be complicated for U.S. companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a>, but early indicators suggest that Costco's concept performs as well as, if not better than, in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a>. Six new stores are planned for China within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a>.

## Future Running Room

Beyond North America and Asia, Costco sees significant global running room in Europe, Africa, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:53">[02:42:53]</a>. The consistent success of their model globally reinforces the idea that the market size for Costco's unique value proposition is vast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:20">[02:42:20]</a>.

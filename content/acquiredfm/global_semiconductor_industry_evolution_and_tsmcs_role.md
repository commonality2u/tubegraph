The [[Semiconductor industry overview | semiconductor industry]] has undergone significant evolution, with [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]] emerging as a pivotal global player. Founded in 1987, [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]] established a unique "Pure Play Foundry" business model, focusing exclusively on manufacturing chips designed by other companies, thereby avoiding direct competition with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. This model, while initially a strategic choice based on available capabilities, proved to be instrumental in the company's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>.

## Founding and Early Strategy

Morris Chang, founder of [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]], observed the emerging trend of "fabless" companiesâ€”chip design firms that did not own manufacturing facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a>. He anticipated the growth of this sector, making [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]]'s dedication to being a pure-play foundry a farsighted decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:04">[02:25:04]</a>. Early on, [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]]'s customers primarily consisted of integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) seeking external capacity for less critical or older-node chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:05]</a>. The company's initial growth was not high as it awaited the full emergence of fabless customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:43">[02:36:43]</a>.

### The Learning Curve Theory

A key strategic principle adopted by [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]] was the learning curve theory, which posits that as a company produces more of a product, its unit cost decreases due to increased experience and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>. Morris Chang refined this theory for the semiconductor industry, emphasizing the importance of becoming the largest volume player to achieve the lowest prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. This strategy sometimes involved initially setting unprofitable prices or accelerating price reductions to gain market share and outcompete rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:40">[02:38:40]</a>.

## Key Relationships and Challenges

### [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | Nvidia]] Partnership

[[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | TSMC]]'s relationship with [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | Nvidia]] began in 1997 when Jensen Huang, then CEO of a small, struggling [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | Nvidia]], reached out directly to Morris Chang after failing to get a response from [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | TSMC]]'s San Jose office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Despite [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | Nvidia]] being only four years old and facing bankruptcy with 50-60 employees, Chang met with Huang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Huang boldly predicted that the chip they wanted manufactured would save [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | Nvidia]] and make it a major [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | TSMC]] customer, generating at least $50 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This prediction came true, and within two to three years, [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | Nvidia]] became one of [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | TSMC]]'s top five largest customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

A significant challenge arose in 2009 with the 40-nanometer (nm) node, experiencing yield and quality issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This problem occurred when another CEO was in charge, who initially denied fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. Morris Chang, after returning as CEO, prioritized resolving this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. He offered [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | Nvidia]] a settlement of over $100 million for damages, which Jensen Huang accepted within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This resolution strengthened the partnership, leading to many billions of dollars in business thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] Partnership and the 20nm Node

The smartphone era, coinciding with the 28nm node, presented a massive opportunity for [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. While [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]] had not initially included [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] in its 28nm planning, the partnership with [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] became a "pleasant surprise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>.

The initial contact with [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] came through Terry Gou, founder and CEO of Foxconn and a relative of Morris Chang's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. In late 2010, Gou brought Jeff Williams, [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]]'s COO, to Chang's home for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. Williams proposed a partnership, initially offering a 40% gross margin, which was lower than [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]]'s then-current 45% margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>.

A key point of contention was [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]]'s request for [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]] to develop a 20nm process node, a "half-step" detour from the planned progression to 16nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. At the time, [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]]'s R&D resources were not sufficient to pursue two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. Accepting this request delayed [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]]'s 16nm node development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>.

In February 2011, [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] paused discussions, indicating that Intel had approached Tim Cook to consider their foundry services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>. Morris Chang, though not overly worried, visited [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] to inquire about the progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:16">[01:42:16]</a>. Tim Cook explained that "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This highlighted Intel's historical arrogance and lack of customer-centric approach compared to [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]]'s willingness to respond courteously to every request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a>.

When [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]] needed additional capital for the 20nm development, they decided to borrow money rather than cut dividends or issue new stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>. Morris Chang informed [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] that [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]] could only fulfill half of their requested demand for the 20nm chips, a decision Jeff Williams accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:32">[01:31:32]</a>.

However, the delay in 16nm development allowed Samsung to get ahead, and [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] initially placed some 16nm orders with Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>. Jeff Williams reassured Chang that [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] would buy from [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]] once their 16nm process was ready, and indeed, most of [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]]'s 16nm requirements eventually came from [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>. This demonstrated the resilience of [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | TSMC]]'s pure-play model, as Samsung was a direct competitor to [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] in end products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:13">[01:55:13]</a>.

## Strategic Investments and Competitive Landscape

### Commitment to 28nm Node

Upon his return as CEO in 2009, Morris Chang instituted a fixed R&D budget of 8% of revenue, regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:30">[01:41:30]</a>. This provided stability and encouraged ambitious R&D efforts, particularly for the 28nm node, which was seen as a "sweet spot" in technology progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:51">[01:43:51]</a>.

In 2010, [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]] significantly increased its capital expenditures from approximately $2-2.5 billion to nearly $6 billion, effectively tripling its investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:01">[01:43:01]</a>. This bold move, which involved betting a huge amount of the company's cash on the 28nm node, faced questions from the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>. Chang, however, was confident based on market forecasts, R&D insights, and business development intelligence, emphasizing that "there's a tide in the affairs of men which taken at its flood leads on to fortune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:34">[01:46:34]</a>. The investment proved successful, coinciding with the boom in smartphone demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>.

### Intel and Qualcomm

[[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]] aimed to make Qualcomm a customer in the 1990s, recognizing them as a technology-focused company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Qualcomm primarily used IBM as its foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>. However, in the late 1990s, Qualcomm shifted its business to [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]], leading Morris Chang to anticipate trouble for IBM's semiconductor division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:10">[01:58:10]</a>. When IBM later proposed a co-development for the .13 micron (130nm) technology in 1999, [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]] refused due to concerns about losing control over its own process development and cultural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. IBM then approached UMC, which accepted but later regretted the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>.

Intel, once a dominant force in the [[Semiconductor industry overview | semiconductor industry]], began to lag in foundry capabilities. In 2011, Morris Chang perceived that Intel was no longer the imposing competitor it once was, especially in the foundry space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>. Intel's difficulty in adapting to the foundry model, where customer trust and responsiveness are paramount, ultimately led to [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]]'s success in securing major clients like [[TSMCs collaboration with Apple and semiconductor manufacturing challenges | Apple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## [[Role of TSMC in the Global Semiconductor Industry | TSMC's Role in the Global Semiconductor Industry]] and Ecosystem

[[Role of TSMC in the Global Semiconductor Industry | TSMC]]'s "Pure Play Foundry" model, combined with the rise of ARM architecture, significantly transformed the [[Semiconductor industry overview | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:51">[02:24:51]</a>. The shift to ARM allowed for a dedicated foundry for ARM chips, creating an opportunity for a standalone manufacturing company in a way that the x86 dominance of Intel did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:26">[02:25:26]</a>. This specialization led to a fragmented but highly efficient value chain, with standalone companies for architecture ([[Role of technology choices and supplier relationships in semiconductor advancements | ARM]]), design (Apple, [[TSMCs relationship with Nvidia | Nvidia]]), manufacturing ([[Role of TSMC in the Global Semiconductor Industry | TSMC]]), and EDA tools (Synopsys, Cadence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:02">[02:27:02]</a>.

The **Hsinchu Science Park** in Taiwan became a central hub for this ecosystem, with [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]], its partners, and customers (like Qualcomm and MediaTek) co-located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:03">[02:28:03]</a>. The proximity of universities and other industry players facilitates extremely close communication and collaboration, making it difficult to replicate this integrated ecosystem elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>. This geographic concentration highlights the significant [[Impact of Geopolitics on TSMC | impact of geopolitics on TSMC]]'s operational advantages. While [[TSMCs Founding and Evolution | TSMC]] is establishing Fabs outside Taiwan (e.g., Arizona), these are not expected to replicate the full "magic" of the Taiwanese ecosystem due to their scale and lack of immediate access to the entire interconnected network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:10">[02:30:10]</a>.

[[Role of TSMC in the Global Semiconductor Industry | TSMC]]'s strategy also involves maintaining older fabs for legacy chips and new applications (like CMOS sensors) that do not require leading-edge technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:50">[02:34:50]</a>. These fully depreciated fabs generate high-margin revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:42">[02:35:42]</a>. This contrasts with Intel's historical approach of repurposing older fabs for leading-edge processes, leading to a loss of capabilities for older node generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:50">[02:33:50]</a>.

## Financial Strategy and Moores Law

[[Role of TSMC in the Global Semiconductor Industry | TSMC]]'s financial strategy is deeply intertwined with its commitment to Moores Law, the observation that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:52">[02:43:52]</a>. The company constantly invests billions of dollars in R&D and capital expenditures to develop and implement the next process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:09">[02:42:09]</a>. Building a new Fab can cost tens of billions of dollars, but the value of the chips produced makes these profitable investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>. This constant reinvestment, fueled by high volume and a disciplined R&D budget, allows [[Role of TSMC in the Global Semiconductor Industry | TSMC]] to maintain its lead in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:51">[02:42:51]</a>.

The [[Semiconductor industry overview | semiconductor market]] has experienced immense growth, from $26 billion in 1987 (TSMC's founding) to $527 billion in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. This "ridiculous Tailwind" allowed [[Role of TSMC in the Global Semiconductor Industry | TSMC]] to grow into a trillion-dollar company, riding the wave of increasing demand for computing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. The market exhibits natural monopoly characteristics, with only a few players capable of deploying the massive capital required for leading-edge manufacturing, further solidifying [[Role of TSMC in the Global Semiconductor Industry | TSMC]]'s dominant position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:03">[02:42:03]</a>.

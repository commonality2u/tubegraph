Investors must possess two primary skills: assessing a company's future potential and comparing that potential value against its current selling price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The foundational principle in equity investments is that all companies are valued based on the discounted value of their [[evaluating_investments_using_cash_flows | future cash flows]] from here to eternity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This valuation process, particularly through a discounted cash flow (DCF) formula, inherently demands [[evaluating_investments_using_cash_flows | judgments about the future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Changing Landscape of Business Durability

Historically, certain industries were considered "impregnable" with strong moats, making their future cash flows seem predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Newspapers, for instance, were once seen as an ideal business due to their localized monopolies, low cost, daily demand, and advertising dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, within 20 years, most companies in the newspaper industry faced existential threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Predicting such a drastic shift in consumer behavior to an "interconnected web of servers" would have seemed "crazy" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Similarly, foreseeing the rise of a short-form video platform from a Chinese company disrupting established social media giants like Facebook and Instagram would have been met with disbelief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Accelerating Technological Adoption

A significant shift influencing future potential is the increased speed of technological adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This acceleration has made companies less durable today compared to the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. In 1950, it was much easier to confidently predict a business's consistency over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Today, companies must constantly evolve, manage their moats, and fend off competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Very few businesses can succeed without vigilant management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The world now feels like it's changing constantly, a stark contrast to the perceived stable "backdrop" of the mid-20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Implications for Valuation

The increased uncertainty regarding future cash flows raises the question of whether companies should be valued less, given that disruption is more likely and moats are less permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This situation presents a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>:
*   On one hand, companies are more susceptible to disruption without active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   On the other hand, companies that leverage their competitive advantages to enter adjacent markets, launch new products, or expand geographically have significantly greater potential for value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The ability to leverage advantages and build value has likely never been higher, especially with the internet enabling access to global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

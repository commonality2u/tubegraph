[[Erwin Mark Jacobs early life and education | Erwin Mark Jacobs]] was born in 1933 in New Bedford, Massachusetts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. New Bedford was once the wealthiest town in America during the whaling era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He grew up in a middle-class family in this "scrappy" area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, where his father worked multiple jobs and eventually ran a local restaurant called the Boston Beef Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Academic Beginnings

As a child, Jacobs was highly gifted in math and sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He desired to study these fields in college and likely would have pursued engineering if he had known it existed as a discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Famously, his high school guidance counselor advised him that there was "no future for Math and Science in New Bedford" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Given his excellent grades, the counselor encouraged him to attend the Cornell School of Hotel Management so he could return to New Bedford and work in his family's restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Jacobs initially enrolled in Cornell's hotel management school, spending a year and a half there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. During this time, he learned about business accounting and real-world applications, which he later credited with helping him transition from academia to entrepreneurship when starting his first company, Linkabit, and then Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. After realizing that one could "make money with math and science" in other parts of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, he sought to transfer to electrical engineering. The dean of Cornell was surprised by his request to transfer from hotel management to electrical engineering, but allowed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## MIT and Early Professorship

After graduating from Cornell, Jacobs pursued a PhD at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. He completed his PhD in a remarkable three years, finishing in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. At MIT, he studied under [[Claude Shannon]], the "father of information theory," who had returned to MIT as a professor after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This mentorship was crucial, as it is considered "extremely unlikely" that Jacobs would have become the influential figure he was without studying under Shannon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Upon completing his PhD, MIT and Shannon immediately asked Jacobs to stay on as a professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He spent five years teaching at MIT, where he taught what is believed to be the world's first course on digital communications to four students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. In this course, he applied Shannon's theories to train practical engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. During this period, he and a fellow faculty member co-wrote the first textbook on digital communications, which is still in use today and regarded as the "Bible of digital communication theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Transition to California and Linkabit

In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical from MIT to work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California, focusing on the U.S. Space Program and satellite communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Here, he met and became fast friends with Andrea "Andy" Viterbi, another MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate working at JPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

After his sabbatical, Jacobs returned to Boston, but shortly thereafter received an offer from a former Cornell professor to start the electrical engineering department at the new UC San Diego (UCSD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Remembering his enjoyable time in California and his friendship with Viterbi, he accepted and moved his family to San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

While a full-time professor at UCSD, Jacobs continued his contracting work with defense contractors and JPL on the U.S. Space Program, typically dedicating one day a week to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. During a flight back from consulting work at NASA Ames with Viterbi and another UCLA professor, Len Kleinrock, they decided to form a "shell company" to manage their consulting work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This company, named "Linkabit" (a play on "linking a bit"), was initially intended only to manage consulting, not to create products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Kleinrock later left Linkabit and went on to become a core founding father of the internet, notably sending the first ARPANET message from UCLA to Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Jacobs and Viterbi continued with Linkabit, focusing on NASA and Navy defense projects, primarily satellite communications, which required highly efficient use of narrow bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. They began building a team of "information theory and wireless signal minds" for defense contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. In 1971, with so much work, Jacobs took a sabbatical from UCSD to organize the company, ultimately never returning to his professorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Linkabit's first commercial project was designing the satellite communication system for Walmart. The retailer's eccentric founder, Sam Walton, wanted to broadcast messages from HQ to all local stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This project was a significant step for Linkabit as it transitioned from subconsulting for defense contractors to bidding on contracts directly and entering the commercial sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

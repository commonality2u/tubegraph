Erwin Mark Jacobs, an American born in 1933, grew up in New Bedford, Massachusetts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. New Bedford was once considered the wealthiest town in America during the whaling era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The Hathaway Manufacturing Company, which later merged with [[entrepreneurial_lessons_from_warren_buffett_and_berkshire_hathaway | Berkshire]], was started in New Bedford 45 years before Jacobs' birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. By 1933, however, New Bedford had moved past its whaling era peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Childhood and Early Interests

Jacobs was raised in a middle-class family in this "scrappy" area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. His father held multiple jobs, eventually running a local eatery called the Boston Beef Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. From a young age, Jacobs demonstrated exceptional aptitude in math and sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He initially wanted to pursue studies in these fields, likely engineering if he had been aware of its existence in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Unexpected Educational Path

Despite his academic gifts, Jacobs' high school guidance counselor advised him that there was "no future for Math and Science in New Bedford" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Given his strong grades, the counselor encouraged him to attend the world-famous [[cornell_school_of_hotel_management_and_its_impact_on_erwin_jacobs | Cornell School of Hotel Management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The intention was for him to learn hospitality management and return to work in the family business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Jacobs did enroll in the hotel management school at Cornell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He later attributed the year and a half he spent there, before transferring to electrical engineering, with helping him in his entrepreneurial ventures, including founding his first company (Linkabit) and later Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This period provided him with practical business knowledge, such as accounting and real-world applications, which he found enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

After discovering that engineering offered financial opportunities with math and science, Jacobs sought to transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. He famously told the Cornell dean he wanted to transfer from hotel management to electrical engineering, a request met with surprise as transfers typically went the other way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Despite initial suspicion, the dean permitted the transfer, recognizing Jacobs' talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Advanced Degrees and Professorship

Jacobs went on to earn a PhD in electrical engineering from MIT, completing the program in just three years, by 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. He studied under Claude Shannon, the "father of information theory," who had returned to MIT as a professor after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This mentorship under Shannon was critical to Jacobs becoming the influential figure he later became <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Upon completing his PhD, Jacobs was invited to stay at MIT as a professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. He spent five years teaching there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. During this time, he taught what is believed to be the world's first course on digital communications to four students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. He also co-authored the first textbook on digital communications, which is still in use today and can be purchased on [[amazons_early_history_and_founding | Amazon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Transition to California and Early Ventures

In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical from MIT and moved to California to work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. At JPL, he contributed to the U.S. Space Program, focusing on communications with satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. It was here that he met Andrew (Andy) Viterbi, another recent MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate who was working at JPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. They quickly became close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

After his sabbatical, Jacobs received a call from a former Cornell professor offering him the opportunity to establish the electrical engineering department at the newly formed UC San Diego (UCSD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Liking his time in California and with Viterbi already there, Jacobs and his family relocated to San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

While a professor at UCSD, Jacobs continued his contracting work with defense contractors and JPL, primarily focusing on the U.S. space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This was initially individual consulting work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. One day, during a flight back from consulting work at NASA Ames in Mountain View, Jacobs, Viterbi, and another UCLA professor, Len Kleinrock, discussed the difficulties of balancing their academic and consulting work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This conversation led them to form a "shell company" called Linkabit to manage their consulting efforts, with no initial intention of creating products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Kleinrock later left Linkabit but went on to be a core founding father of the internet, leading the ARPANET project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Linkabit, primarily led by Jacobs and Viterbi, focused on NASA and Navy defense projects in San Diego, specializing in satellite communications due to the need for efficient bandwidth usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. They began to leverage spread spectrum technology, patented by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil during World War II, to achieve this efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Jacobs found increasing enjoyment in the business aspects of running the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. By 1971, Jacobs took a sabbatical from UCSD to organize Linkabit, ultimately never returning to his professorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. It was during this period that Linkabit shifted from being a sub-consultant to bidding directly on contracts, recognizing the better economics of being a prime contractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This led Linkabit to seek commercial opportunities, with their first major project being the satellite communication system for Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

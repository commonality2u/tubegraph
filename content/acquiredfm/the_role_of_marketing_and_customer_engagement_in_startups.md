Marketing and customer engagement play crucial roles in the growth and sustainability of startups. This article explores these roles, drawing insights from a compelling interview with Eric Yuan, founder of Zoom, and Peter Gassner, founder of Veeva Systems.

## Marketing in Startups

Marketing is often seen as a major driver of growth in startups, yet the approach to marketing can vary significantly based on the company's strategy and market position.

### Delayed Investment in Marketing

Eric Yuan, founder of Zoom, detailed an interesting approach to marketing, where he initially opted not to invest heavily in this area. For the first several years, Zoom did not have a marketing team. Yuan believed that the product itself should be able to speak for its value without extensive marketing efforts. This approach was particularly suited to Zoom because it operated in a mature market where potential users were already familiar with video conferencing solutions. Eric stated:

### Measuring and Optimizing Marketing Spend

Despite the initial lack of a marketing team, as Zoom grew, marketing became a significant focus. Yuan emphasized the importance of measuring and optimizing marketing spend. When the marketing team was eventually formed, Yuan was very hands-on in assessing the return on investment [[venture_capital_and_investment_strategies]]:

> "Even today still, I think it's very tricky [...] when to invest in marketing is very tricky every business is different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.  

Marketing investments, including decisions on spending for SEM (Search Engine Marketing), were closely scrutinized to ensure they provided a strong return [[product_excellence_and_market_fit]]:

> "They told me, give me one dollar, I give 1.50 back... I said no, you should have three dollars back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Customer Engagement

Customer engagement is another vital aspect, closely linked to the marketing efforts. Both Yuan and Gassner emphasized the importance of customer satisfaction and using early feedback to enhance products.

### Building Customer Relationships

An exemplar strategy used by Zoom involved maintaining a strong, positive relationship with its early user base. After an initial surge from a Wall Street Journal article, many users left, but those who stayed became crucial to Zoom's long-term success [[customer_engagement]].

> "Even 100 [users] are good enough... they are the most loyal users [...] double down to make sure they are happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.  

### Consistent Feedback Loop

Eric Yuan's approach included personally engaging with customers, especially when they decided to cancel. He reached out to understand their reasons and sought feedback for improvement, maintaining a direct line to the customer base [[importance_of_partnerships_in_business]]:

> "When they canceled back then... I personally sent them an email why you can serve a service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

The insights shared by Eric Yuan and Peter Gassner underscore the importance of strategic timing and measurement in marketing, as well as the necessity of fostering deep customer relationships in the formative years of a startup. While a delayed marketing team was right for Zoom's early strategy due to its focus on product excellence, the eventual need to engage in strategic marketing was vital for scaling. Conversion of early adopters into loyal users proved essential to spreading value through word of mouth, thereby enhancing both marketing efficacy and customer engagement in the long run [[entrepreneurship_and_venture_capital]].

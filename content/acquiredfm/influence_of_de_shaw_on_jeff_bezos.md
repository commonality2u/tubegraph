Upon graduating college in 1986, [[Jeff Bezos early career and work at startup Primtel|Jeff Bezos]] initially worked for a startup called Fytel, which developed early network technology for high-speed trading applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This experience with early networked computing provided him with a foundational understanding of how technology works and its practical implications, allowing him to "feel the types of applications" that could be built using the infrastructure of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

In 1988, [[Jeff Bezos transition to investment banking|Bezos transitioned into investment banking]], joining Bankers Trust, which later became part of Deutsche Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. During this time, he was likely involved in quantitative trading and finance given his computer science background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. He also befriended Halsey Minor and they almost started a financial newsletter startup together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>; Minor later founded CNET, which, like [[Amazons founding and early years|Amazon]], distributed written content over the budding World Wide Web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Joining DE Shaw

In 1990, a headhunter convinced [[Jeff Bezos decision to leave DE Shaw and start Amazon|Bezos]] to interview at D. E. Shaw, a financial firm founded a couple of years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. [[Jeff Bezos decision to leave DE Shaw and start Amazon|Bezos]] "completely falls in love" with the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

### About David E. Shaw
The founder, David E. Shaw, was a computer science PhD from Stanford in the 1980s, who became a computer science professor at Columbia University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. It's assumed he was associated with the professors who founded Fytel, [[Jeff Bezos early career and work at startup Primtel|Bezos]]'s first employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Shaw was a serious academic, later winning the Gordon Bell Prize and becoming a member of the National Academy of Engineering and Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. His stepfather was a finance professor at UCLA, leading to his interest in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

Shaw left Columbia in 1986 to join Morgan Stanley and started D. E. Shaw in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. His model for the firm was [[Influence of historical figures like Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett|Jim Simons]], who started Renaissance Technologies (RenTec) in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. RenTec's Medallion Fund famously averaged a 66.1% annual return from 1988 to 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

### Culture and Entrepreneurship
While D. E. Shaw operated as a quant hedge fund, they resisted being solely defined by it, viewing themselves as a "group of creative artisans" who invested in and started businesses, coming up with new ideas and viewing the world through different lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This philosophy greatly appealed to [[Jeff Bezos decision to leave DE Shaw and start Amazon|Bezos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

[[Jeff Bezos decision to leave DE Shaw and start Amazon|Bezos]] quickly rose to become the fourth senior vice president at D. E. Shaw, the highest level below David Shaw, and was likely the youngest at the time in his mid-to-late 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. He and David Shaw became "super close," with Shaw likely serving as a mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

### Recruiting and Talent
[[Jeff Bezos decision to leave DE Shaw and start Amazon|Bezos]] was involved in recruiting, bringing in "super smart people of all disciplines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. The firm's motto was to find the smartest people in the world, regardless of their business or finance knowledge, and then find tasks for them, a philosophy similar to Bridgewater today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Several individuals who later became key early [[Amazons founding and early years|Amazon]] employees, such as Jeff Holden and Nicholas Lovejoy, were recruited during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

It was also at D. E. Shaw that [[Jeff Bezos decision to leave DE Shaw and start Amazon|Bezos]] met and married MacKenzie Scott (Tuttle), a Princeton graduate recruited to the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. MacKenzie is technically considered [[Amazons founding and early years|Amazon]]'s first employee, working on accounting and legal operations before the first engineer was hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

### Internet Business Exploration
David Shaw utilized [[Jeff Bezos decision to leave DE Shaw and start Amazon|Bezos]]'s talents, assigning him to lead projects. The first major project was building a "third market business" to allow retail investors to trade off-exchange without high commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>, which arguably served as a predecessor to modern dark pools and payment for order flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

Critically, David Shaw and [[Jeff Bezos decision to leave DE Shaw and start Amazon|Bezos]], with their strong technical backgrounds and connections to individuals starting the internet, became "really excited" about the nascent internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration|Bezos himself had used the internet in college]] when it was still command-prompt based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. Shaw reassigned [[Jeff Bezos decision to leave DE Shaw and start Amazon|Bezos]] to work with him on developing business plans for "internet opportunities within D. E. Shaw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. Their first project was exploring an online retail brokerage for financial trading, similar to E*Trade, possibly as a transformation of the "third market business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. This focus on internet opportunities directly foreshadowed [[Jeff Bezos decision to leave DE Shaw and start Amazon|Bezos]]'s later decision to start [[Amazons founding and early years|Amazon]].

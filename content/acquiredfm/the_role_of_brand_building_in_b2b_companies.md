Traditionally, [[branding_and_marketing_strategies | brand building]] has been reserved for consumer companies, but Bill McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow, emphasizes its crucial role for enterprise software providers like ServiceNow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He believes that for an enterprise company, being a brand-led organization is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.

## Brand as Identity and Vision

McDermott views brand as the company's identity and DNA, representing who they are and what they aim to convey to a broad base of global customers in the simplest way possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. ServiceNow's dream tagline, "The world works with ServiceNow," ties into their aspiration to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century, which necessitates being a "world's company" that makes things work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.

The focus is always on seeing the world through the customer's eyes and understanding their objectives. Being a brand-led company with empathy for the customer is central to ServiceNow's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

## Marketing and Brand Ambassadors

ServiceNow engages in strategic [[branding_and_marketing_strategies | marketing]] initiatives, such as commercials featuring Idris Elba, who serves as their multi-year brand ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. This partnership goes beyond simple endorsement; Elba believes in ServiceNow's mission, demonstrated by their collaboration on projects like the reinvention of Sherbro Island to bring technology, water, and systems that can foster a more prosperous nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. This emphasizes that the brand ambassador not only believes in the brand but also in its capacity to improve people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.

In recent advertisements, Elba highlights ServiceNow's focus on integrating AI across every corner of the enterprise, addressing the common problem of siloed systems within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.

## Elements of an Extraordinary Brand

For a brand to be extraordinary and among the best in the world, McDermott outlines several key components:
*   **Great Products:** Producing the best products globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.
*   **Exceptional Service:** Providing the best service worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **Strong Team:** Bringing the best team to the customer relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>.
*   **Prolific Ecosystem Standards:** Developing partners who are well-trained, committed to the brand, and share the same values and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

McDermott's dream is for ServiceNow to become a top 10 brand globally, acknowledging that enterprise companies are typically less recognized than consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. He credits consumer brands like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft for their strong brands, noting that even those with significant enterprise presence are often known through their consumer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. He particularly praises Apple for the magnificent user experience and the feeling its brand conveys, creating an enormous, complex ecosystem that operates simply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. This approach to [[branding_and_marketing_strategies | brand building]] is not the standard playbook for enterprise companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

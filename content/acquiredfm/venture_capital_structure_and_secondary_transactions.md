The early history of eBay and its financing provides a compelling case study on [[challenges_and_adaptations_in_venture_capital | challenges and adaptations in venture capital]] and the emergence of secondary transactions in funding rounds.

## Early Ventures and Connections
Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, previously worked at a pen computing company called Inc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> Bruce Dunleavy from Merrill Pickard Anderson and Eyre was an investor in Inc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> While the pen computing space, apart from Palm Pilot, did not largely pan out, Inc. pivoted into early e-commerce software enablement and was eventually sold to Microsoft, resulting in a positive outcome for investors and the management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:01:01]</a>. Omidyar, an engineer at Inc., developed a relationship with Bruce Dunleavy during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

After Inc., Omidyar joined General Magic, a company credited with inventing concepts like cloud and mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. His background in pen computing made his move to General Magic logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## The Genesis of eBay
While working full-time at General Magic, Omidyar began "tinkering around" on the early internet in his free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This led to the creation of a collection of internet services he called eBay, an abbreviation for "electronic Bay Area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:16]</a>. Among these services was "AuctionWeb," which ultimately became the core of eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:49]</a>.

Initially, Omidyar hosted auctions for free, but server costs quickly escalated due to high traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:47]</a>. He reluctantly introduced a small listing fee, which users paid by sending checks to his apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:04:02]</a>. This overwhelming response demonstrated "product market fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:06]</a>. Jeff Skoll, a newly minted MBA from Stanford, was brought on as the "business guy" to manage the influx of checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:23]</a>. The decision to charge fees prevented eBay from becoming a non-profit resource like Wikipedia or Craigslist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:41]</a>.

## The Investment Dilemma: Benchmark vs. Knight Ridder
By June 1997, eBay was growing at 10% per month and was profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Despite having cash flow, Omidyar recognized the value of [[venture_capital_dynamics_and_firm_structure | VCS]] and a professional board, based on his experiences at Inc. and General Magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:23]</a>.

Omidyar and Skoll pitched their business to numerous [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | VC firms]] on Sand Hill Road, but nearly all turned them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:33]</a>. Benchmark, however, showed interest, with Bruce Dunleavy, his partner Bob, and later David all contributing to the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:06:06]</a>. Benchmark offered a Series A financing of $6.7 million at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:18]</a>.

A competing offer came from Knight Ridder, a large newspaper conglomerate. This was an acquisition offer of $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:38]</a>. This was a significant sum, especially for a two-person company that was "barely a company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:54]</a>.

## The Untraditional Secondary Transaction
There is historical debate about the exact structure and use of Benchmark's investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:08:05]</a>. What is generally agreed upon is that eBay likely did not burn any of Benchmark's investment, as the company was consistently profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:28]</a>. Benchmark obtained 20% or more equity in eBay, reported as 22.1% at IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:57]</a>.

A key and "highly untraditional" aspect of the deal was the reported provision of equity-backed loans to Omidyar and Skoll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:10:32]</a>. The Washington Post reported that Benchmark structured $750,000 equity-backed loans to each founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:13]</a>.

This effectively served as a secondary transaction, paying $1.5 million to Omidyar and Skoll to incentivize them not to take the Knight Ridder acquisition offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:33]</a>. One Benchmark partner from the time also stated that $3 million of the $6.7 million investment was used as a secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:53]</a>.

This structure was non-consensus at the time, allowing entrepreneurs to "take some money off the table" early, preventing them from selling the company for a lower sum and instead aiming for a much larger outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:54]</a>. This approach was later observed in deals like the Clubhouse funding round, where secondary transactions became more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Monumental Returns and Impact
The deal closed in the summer of 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. By September 1998, just over a year later, eBay went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:41]</a>. Benchmark, having helped recruit Meg Whitman as CEO, saw its $6.7 million investment valued at $400 million at the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:12:17]</a>.

Due to a six-month lockup period, Benchmark could not distribute its shares immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:24]</a>. By the time the lockup expired in spring 1999, their stake was worth over $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:31]</a>. This represented a return of $4 billion on an $85 million fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:38]</a>, with the $6.7 million investment turning into $4 billion in under two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:43]</a>. This alone generated a 47x return on their fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:51]</a>.

If the reported secondary/equity-backed loans were indeed incremental to the equity investment, this could have added another $1 billion kicker to the returns, resulting in an additional 12x return on the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:13:20]</a>. Benchmark distributed at least $4 billion to its limited partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:39]</a>.

Despite the dot-com bust in 2000, which negatively impacted many investments, eBay remained strong, ensuring a confirmed 50x return on the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:14:12]</a>. This success meant that the usual "first one X" return to limited partners before general partners participate in carry was a "rounding error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:31]</a>. Even by conservative estimates, the eBay investment generated $1.5 billion in carry dollars to be distributed among the equal partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:54]</a>. Famously, Benchmark also gave pieces of carry to its assistants, leading to stories of them becoming multi-millionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:13]</a>.

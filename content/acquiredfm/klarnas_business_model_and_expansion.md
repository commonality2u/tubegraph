Klarna is a financial technology company co-founded by Sebastian Siemiatkowski, founded 19 years ago in Stockholm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Initially known as a "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) company, Klarna has ambitions to play a broader role in the payments landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It currently serves 150 million consumers globally, empowering 2 million payments daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Founding Insights and Early Business Model

Sebastian Siemiatkowski was inspired to start a company by the founder of [[IKEAs business model and operational structure|IKEA]], Ingvar Kamprad, and Richard Branson's book about Virgin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. His insight came from a job at an account receivables factoring/collection company during a low economy following the dot-com bubble burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

At the time (around 2003) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, while card payments were prevalent, mail-order businesses traditionally offered a "bill me" option, providing credit for distance selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This allowed consumers to receive and inspect a product before paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. In Sweden, where debit cards were common and credit cards were perceived as dangerous, online shopping carried significant risk for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Siemiatkowski observed that early e-commerce companies were not offering this "open invoice payment method" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> (which later merged into BNPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. He realized that online merchants, particularly smaller ones, were most concerned with the risk of customers not paying and the administrative burden of collections, rather than immediate cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Klarna's initial business model involved underwriting and acquiring accounts receivables from merchants, taking on the risk and administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Crucially, Klarna did not pay the merchants until three weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This, combined with many consumers paying instantaneously, resulted in a positive cash flow for Klarna, effectively being funded by its merchants for the first few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The company quickly became profitable, spending only $30,000 before achieving profitability within about six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This model made [[Plaids business and growth strategies|Klarna's growth and expansion strategies]] highly effective, as merchants saw increased sales and consumers felt more secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

## [[Plaids business and growth strategies|Expansion and Market Evolution]]

Klarna's early geographical expansion focused on neighboring Scandinavian countries like Norway and Finland, driven by merchant demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Next, they targeted Germany and the Netherlands, where a strong tradition of invoice payments already existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

Initially, Klarna believed there was no need for its product in credit-card-prevalent markets like the US and UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. However, around 2015, a small team in the UK identified a significant opportunity for BNPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This was due to a new generation of card users who primarily used debit cards or disliked credit cards, often influenced by poor experiences or the 2007 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. These "self-aware avoiders" were described in a 2014 McKinsey report as a segment not catered to by traditional credit cards, valuing simple, transparent fees, and avoidance of mishaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

This segment's needs aligned perfectly with Klarna's original "pay later" model, which focused on providing safety and trust rather than just credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This insight, which also drove Afterpay's success in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, opened up the US market for Klarna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

### Evolution of Product and Competitive Landscape

For a period between 2010 and 2015, Klarna attempted to [[product_expansion_and_market_exploration|expand its product offering]] by competing with payment service providers (PSPs) like Stripe and Adyen, aiming to "close the loop" by being both merchant acquirer, PSP, and issuer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Klarna Checkout achieved significant success in the Nordics, processing over 50% of online transactions at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. However, they struggled with international expansion, particularly in the US due to Shopify's dominance in checkout services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.

By 2015, recognizing they couldn't compete effectively with Stripe and Adyen on the merchant side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>, Klarna pivoted to focus on the consumer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. This strategic shift involved moving away from being a direct competitor to PSPs and instead integrating with them as distributors of Klarna's product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

Klarna's business model is contrasted with traditional credit card models, which generate high revenue from revolving interest rates and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. While Klarna also offers financing for higher-ticket items, it aims to be more consumer-friendly, offering transparent terms and avoiding tactics that promote over-indebtedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. The company aims to reintroduce options like "press one for debit, press two for credit" at point-of-sale, which were removed by banks because they led to less revolving credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Klarna's debit volume is currently around 35% in some European countries, with an ambition for it to reach 50/50 online and 80/20 in-store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

## Consumer-Focused Strategy and Data Advantage

The pivot to a consumer-focused strategy in 2015 envisioned a future where a "digital financial assistant" would manage personal finances, optimizing services like mortgages automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. To win in this future, Klarna identified two key factors:
1.  **Global Scale**: Being global over local is beneficial as it's a question of volume and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. This necessitated aggressive expansion into more markets, especially the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>.
2.  **Data**: More data enables better advice and services of value to the consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

Klarna possesses a unique advantage in its SKU-level data, which it has collected since its inception as an open invoice business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. Unlike [[Visas business model and economic impact|Visa]] or Mastercard, which typically only receive transaction amounts and merchant names, Klarna knows the exact items purchased (e.g., "this sweater of this color of this size from H&M") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. This data allows Klarna to provide richer transaction history, even displaying images of purchased items to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.

While a traditional four-party network like [[Visas business model and economic impact|Visa]] struggles to implement SKU-level data due to needing banks to update their apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>, Klarna's third-party network (like American Express or PayPal) can make this information visible instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>. Klarna has also invested in its brand, emphasizing "smooth and pink," to build a strong consumer identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.

To increase reach beyond integrated merchants, Klarna developed a browser within its app that allows users to shop with Klarna anywhere online using virtual one-time [[Visas business model and economic impact|Visa]] cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. This browser experience also allows Klarna to collect SKU-level data from these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. This strategy helped Klarna gain traction in the US, outperforming competitors like Afterpay in app downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.

## Financial Trajectory and AI Integration

Klarna was profitable from its early years until 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>. While raising significant capital, much of it was initially through secondary transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. However, with the decision to go "all in" on the US and rapid expansion, Klarna began heavy investment, leading to significant losses for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>. Despite a peak valuation of $46 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>, a subsequent market correction saw its valuation drop, leading to public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

Klarna is now focused on achieving a revenue line that goes up while a cost curve goes down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>, inspired by Elon Musk's cost-conscious approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key enabler of this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. Klarna has reduced its hiring and is actively reapplying and rethinking its organizational structure to do "more with less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.

A notable application of AI at Klarna has been in customer service. By implementing AI, Klarna achieved customer satisfaction levels on par with human agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This led to a dramatic reduction in human customer service interactions by two-thirds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>. While this shift primarily impacts third-party customer service providers who can reassign agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>, Klarna aims to encourage society to consider the broader implications of AI on jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.

Klarna predicts a "revival of fintech" and expects companies that fully integrate AI into their core operations to accelerate ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. These "Tigers" will achieve significantly higher revenue per employee than historical norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>, and be much faster at delivering new services and improving software quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. This will make it increasingly difficult for traditional banks with their slower decision-making and older technology stacks to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.

The intricate and often surprising [[impact_of_history_and_relationships_in_silicon_valley | relationships between tech entrepreneurs and companies]] can lead to significant outcomes, as exemplified by the story of Junglee, Amazon, and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Junglee Acquisition by Amazon and its Aftermath

One of the "craziest" acquisitions involves a company named Junglee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Junglee was a comparison shopping site founded by three Stanford Computer Science PhDs and a business person from Netscape named Ram Shriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Amazon acquired Junglee for approximately $150-$175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Despite the acquisition, the relationship between Amazon and the Junglee team was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Amazon required the Palo Alto-based Junglee team to relocate to Seattle to avoid a tax nexus in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, the Junglee team disliked Seattle, and the acquisition was considered "ill-conceived from the get-go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Within a few months, the entire Junglee team quit Amazon and moved back to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

> Upon returning to Palo Alto, this same Junglee team would eventually start the company that Walmart would acquire, which became Walmart Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This entity is considered a significant reason why Walmart is a strong competitor in e-commerce today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This illustrates how [[history_and_strategy_of_technology_companies | early corporate decisions]] can have long-lasting, indirect impacts on the competitive landscape.

## Ram Shriram and the Genesis of Google's Funding

After the Junglee acquisition, Ram Shriram, the business person from Netscape, maintained connections with his former co-founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Through these connections, Shriram was introduced to two other Stanford Computer Science PhDs: Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Page and Brin were seeking to raise money for their project, BackRub (later PageRank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Recognizing the potential, Shriram invested the first $250,000 in Google and joined its board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This early [[venture_capital_and_founder_relationship_dynamics | investment and board involvement]] highlights the critical role of angel investors and early advisors in [[the_critical_role_of_founders_in_startup_success | startup success]].

## Jeff Bezos's Personal Investment in Google

Despite the Junglee team's departure from Amazon, Ram Shriram and Jeff Bezos remained friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. About six months after Shriram's initial investment, Bezos heard about Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Bezos called Shriram, expressing a desire to meet Page and Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Shriram invited Bezos and his then-wife, MacKenzie, to his house in Silicon Valley for a breakfast meeting with Larry and Sergey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

After the breakfast, Bezos privately told Shriram that he wanted to invest in Google as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Despite the seed round being closed and larger venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital circling for a Series A round, Bezos insisted on investing on the same terms as Shriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Shriram advocated for Bezos, convincing Page and Brin to accept another $250,000 of Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos's personal money at the original seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The subsequent Series A for Google, split between John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and Mike Moritz of Sequoia, valued Google at a $100 million post-money valuation, which was considered "insane for the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Mike Moritz famously commented on the investment, "We've never paid so much for so little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The seed round valuation was estimated to be around $10 million or even lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## The Tremendous Returns of Early Relationships

It is estimated that Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos personally owned at least one percent of Google, even after dilution from the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Google did not raise another venture round, going public solely on that Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Google IPO'd in 2004 with a $23 billion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. At that time, Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos's shares would have been worth approximately $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Over the subsequent 18 years, Google's value increased by 65x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Jeff Bezos has never commented on whether he and MacKenzie sold their Google shares, but they would not have had the opportunity to sell before the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

This personal investment provided Bezos with substantial capital for other ventures, such as investing in "crazy cool clocks and rocket companies and venture funds" like Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This story serves as a prime example of how maintaining [[impact_of_history_and_relationships_in_silicon_valley | relationships]], even after a failed corporate acquisition, can lead to monumental personal and financial opportunities for [[advice_and_insights_for_entrepreneurs_and_founders | entrepreneurs and founders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. It also demonstrates the [[the_impact_of_technology_on_venture_investments | significant impact of technology on venture investments]] and the interconnectedness of Silicon Valley's tech ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

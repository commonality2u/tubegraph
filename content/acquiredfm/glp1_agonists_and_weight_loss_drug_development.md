[[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]], the company behind the sensational [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]] and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, has historically focused almost all its revenue on metabolic health, particularly [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | insulin]] and [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]] for the last 100 years [01:01:19].

## The Rise of GLP1 Drugs
The molecule semaglutide, found in Ozempic and Wegovy, was first trialed by [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] in 2008 for type 2 [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]] treatment, building on research from the early 1990s [02:51:01]. Despite the public perception of these drugs "magically appearing," the fact that GLP1 drugs could reduce food intake was discovered in the mid-1990s [03:08:11]. However, it wasn't until 2021 that clinical trials conclusively demonstrated their effectiveness [03:21:21].

### Understanding GLP1s
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) is a hormone that, when simulated by agonists, generally raises the baseline of the body's ability to secrete [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | insulin]], making a person behave more like someone without [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]] [03:17:19].

GLP1s work primarily by:
*   **Increasing Satiety** The natural GLP1 produced in the gut travels to the brain, triggering a response that signals fullness and reduces hunger [02:16:49]. This can quiet the impulse to fixate on food [02:17:10].
*   **Slowing Digestion** The drug can also slow down the digestive process, making a person feel full for longer as food takes more time to move through the system [02:17:18].

Initial observations suggested that very large amounts of GLP1 could cause rats to stop eating and even starve themselves, an effect that persisted in human trials, though not as dramatically at typical doses [01:58:51]. This effect of reduced food intake and weight loss was not the primary focus during early [[product_development_during_economic_challenges | product development]] for [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]] [01:59:22].

### The Stigma of Weight Loss Drugs
Historically, there has been a significant stigma around weight loss drugs due to past dangerous medications like Fen-Phen [02:00:32]. Fen-Phen, a combination of two previously approved drugs, was rushed to market by [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | Pharma industry]] companies and caused severe heart damage in millions of users [02:02:22]. Prior to this, amphetamines were even used for weight loss in the 1970s [02:01:41]. Researchers also believed it was impossible to create a weight loss drug that was both safe and effective [02:01:30]. This history led most [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | Pharma]] companies to avoid research and [[product_development_during_economic_challenges | development]] in the weight loss category [02:02:55].

As late as 2005, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s CEO stated that obesity was "primarily a social and cultural problem" with "no business for [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] in that area" [02:04:14].

## Key Developments in GLP1 Drug Research

### Liraglutide (Victoza, Saxenda)
Led by researcher Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, a team within [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] persisted in studying GLP1 despite widespread industry and academic skepticism due to its short half-life (about 5 minutes) in the human body [01:46:00]. By the mid-1990s, Knudsen developed a GLP1 analog called liraglutide, which included a fatty acid grafted onto the molecule [01:48:49]. This fatty acid prevented the body from breaking it down quickly, extending its half-life to 13 hours [01:49:59].

Liraglutide, marketed as **Victoza** for [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]] treatment, was approved in 2010 [02:08:05]. It quickly became a "Blockbuster" drug, achieving over $1 billion in sales in its first full year (2011) [02:08:55]. While approved for [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]], many patients, and doctors, began using it off-label for weight loss [02:09:40].

In 2013, a slightly higher dose of liraglutide, marketed as **Saxenda**, was submitted for official weight loss approval [02:11:16]. However, it only yielded an average of 8% BMI reduction, falling short of the "magical 10% weight loss reduction number" that industry researchers believed was necessary for mass market adoption [02:12:03].

### Semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus)
Around 2016, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] began Phase 3 trials for their next-generation GLP1 analog, semaglutide [02:14:53]. Semaglutide offered significant advantages over liraglutide:
*   **Longer Half-Life:** It lasts much longer in the body, requiring only once-a-week injections instead of once-a-day [02:15:39].
*   **Higher Efficacy:** It is twice as effective for weight loss, leading to 15% or more long-term BMI reduction, surpassing the critical 10% threshold [02:16:00].

Semaglutide was approved as **Ozempic** for [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]] in 2018 and quickly hit over $1 billion in revenue in 2019 despite being massively supply-constrained [02:19:25]. In 2021, the official weight loss version, **Wegovy**, received FDA approval [02:20:59]. In its first month, Wegovy saw as many prescriptions as Saxenda had in its entire drug lifetime, reflecting immense demand [02:21:07]. The New York Times called it a "game-changer," noting it could help patients "dodge many of its worst consequences including [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]]" [02:21:42].

[[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] also developed **Rybelsus**, an oral, once-daily pill version of semaglutide for those who prefer not to use injections [02:53:39].

### Eli Lilly's GLP1 Contributions
Eli Lilly, a major [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | insulin]] producer, also played a role in the GLP1 story:
*   **Byetta (Exenatide):** In a completely parallel and unlikely development, American researchers discovered a hormone in the venom of the Gila monster lizard that acted as a GLP1 analog and didn't break down quickly [01:52:16]. This research, conducted in part by Daniel Drucker of the University of Toronto (bringing the story full circle to [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | insulin]]'s discovery) [01:59:54], was licensed to Eli Lilly and became the world's first GLP1 analog drug on the market in 2005, named Byetta [01:54:06]. However, Byetta required two daily injections and was not overwhelmingly more effective than existing oral anti-diabetics [01:54:40].
*   **Mounjaro / Zepbound (Tirzepatide):** Eli Lilly's latest GLP1 drug, tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]] (approved May 2022) and Zepbound for weight loss (approved November 2023), acts as a dual GLP1 and GIP receptor agonist [02:35:11]. This bundling of two hormones makes it potentially more effective for both weight loss and [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | insulin]] production [02:35:35].

## Market Impact and Challenges
The global market for weight loss drugs was only $744 million until 2020, with little effective or safe options [02:03:13]. The arrival of highly effective GLP1s transformed this, with [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s market cap soaring to nearly half a trillion dollars by late 2023 [02:22:11]. In 2023, 69% of [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s revenue came from GLP1 drugs for [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]] and obesity, with only 22% from [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | insulin]] [02:23:20].

### Cost and Access
GLP1 drugs like Ozempic cost over $1,000 per month in the US before insurance, and Wegovy costs over $1,300 per month [02:27:30]. In contrast, in Canada, Ozempic is $147/month, and in the UK, $93/month [02:27:47].

Access in the US is complicated:
*   **Private Insurers:** Due to the average American holding a job for only 3.7 years, private insurers are incentivized to cover treatments that pay back in less than that time, or those with overwhelming employee demand [02:28:34]. The long-term health benefits of weight loss (e.g., preventing future costly complications) are often offloaded onto future insurers or Medicare [02:29:28].
*   **Medicare:** Medicare (for those over 65) is legally prohibited from covering weight loss drugs [02:30:53]. Despite efforts to change this law, it hasn't passed [02:31:01]. This policy stems partly from the historical stigma of obesity as a "lifestyle problem" rather than a disease [02:31:09].
*   **Pricing Complexity:** The US healthcare system involves many middlemen, including Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs) who negotiate rebates with manufacturers, often resulting in complex net pricing far below the sticker price [02:59:44]. These rebates often don't directly benefit the patient [03:10:47].

The high list price combined with the potential for 40% of the US population being obese means payers fear the massive short-term cost of covering these drugs for everyone [02:34:11].

### Side Effects and Adherence
Common side effects of GLP1 drugs include nausea, vomiting, and constipation, which can make some patients feel unwell [02:17:41]. Approximately one in six patients experience side effects severe enough to discontinue the drug [02:17:54]. Additionally, non-adherence is a significant issue; as many as 68% of people stop taking GLP1s after a year [02:39:10]. Reasons include price, changes in insurance coverage, supply constraints, and unmanaged side effects [02:39:17]. When treatment stops, weight regain is common [02:39:41].

One potential downside being studied is that GLP1s may lead to a higher loss of lean muscle mass (around 40%) compared to traditional diet and exercise (25%) [03:35:50]. Concerns about suicidal thoughts have been raised, but current research suggests this is not a major risk [03:36:38].

## Broader Implications for the Pharmaceutical Industry
The [[pharmaceutical_industry_economics_and_innovation | Pharma industry]] is a high-risk, high-return venture business [03:11:46]. The average cost to bring a drug to market is $2.5 billion [03:11:11]. The industry's [[legal_and_patent_strategies | patent]]-driven model means that profits are highly concentrated, with only 10% of drugs making it to market, and one drug often providing half of a company's profits [03:12:39].

The success of GLP1s highlights a shift back to mass-population drugs from specialty drugs that treat rare diseases with extremely high price tags (e.g., millions of dollars per dose) [03:07:34]. This concentration on broad conditions like obesity, which affects a billion people worldwide [01:56:58], offers enormous market potential.

The experience of [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]], which maintained a singular focus on [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | diabetes]] and metabolic health for a century, suggests that long-term focus and iterative [[product_development_during_economic_challenges | product development]] can lead to breakthroughs [02:57:42]. The company's unique ownership by a non-profit foundation, which holds 77% of voting shares [03:36:57], has allowed for a long-term strategic horizon, even rejecting a merger in 2004 that management desired [01:39:50]. This foundation, [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo]] Holdings, is the world's largest charitable foundation by endowment ($120 billion) [02:59:48], actively reinvesting in life sciences research.

The ongoing competition between [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]] and Eli Lilly in the GLP1 space (e.g., [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo Nordisk]]'s semaglutide vs. Eli Lilly's tirzepatide) echoes the historical "blood sport" competition between [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Novo]] and [[novo_nordisks_history_and_corporate_structure | Nordisk]] in the [[insulin_market_and_diabetes_treatment_evolution | insulin]] market [00:40:53]. This competition is expected to drive further innovation and increase supply in the GLP1 market for years to come [02:36:16].# GLP1 Agonists and Weight Loss Drug Development

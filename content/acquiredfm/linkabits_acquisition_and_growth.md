Linkabit, co-founded by Irwin and Andy, developed a video scrambling system for pay TV on cable systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This technology was a key solution for multiple access cable systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Early Innovations
Before Linkabit's solution, individuals with mild technical skills could potentially access early pay TV channels like HBO for free using an Allen wrench <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The company, led by Jacobs, Veteri, and their "Brain Trust," successfully solved this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Their system was adopted by HBO and other major paid TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It's even suggested that the HBO opener, with its scrambled de-scrambling visual, was inspired by Linkabit's technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The M/A-COM Acquisition
In 1980, after operating throughout the 1970s, Linkabit was acquired by M/A-COM (originally Matcom), an East Coast radio technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The sale was for $25 million in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This was considered a "nice early win" for the former academics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Post-Acquisition Growth and Departure
After the acquisition, Linkabit continued to grow significantly within M/A-COM, expanding from over 1,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> to eventually 1,500 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. During this period, other retailers and cable TV channels began adopting Linkabit's solutions, indicating its substantial business presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Despite the growth, the founders remained with M/A-COM for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. In 1985, a leadership change at M/A-COM, an East Coast technology company, prompted Jacobs, Veteri, and their team to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Founding of Qualcomm
After their departure, recognizing the nascent wireless communications industry and sensing a massive opportunity, the founders along with five other top Linkabit engineers decided to start a new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This new venture, founded in July 1985, was named Qualcomm, short for "Quality Communications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This decision, stemming from their [[insights_on_tech_investment_strategies_and_decisions | investment strategies]] and deep technical expertise, allowed them to pursue what would become one of the most brilliant strategic executions in market entry, as noted by Bill Gurley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. They recognized the need for a better, digital approach to cellular networks, which was the core idea behind Qualcomm's formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

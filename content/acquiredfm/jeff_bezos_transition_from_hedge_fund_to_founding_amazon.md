[[jeff_bezos_early_career_and_education | Jeff Bezos early career and education]] provided a foundational understanding of technology and finance that would later inform his entrepreneurial endeavors.

### Early Career and Entry into Finance
After graduating college in 1986, Jeff Bezos initially worked for a startup called Phytel, founded by Columbia computer science professors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This company focused on developing early network technology for high-speed trading applications, a precursor to modern co-located data centers for financial exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Bezos spent two years at Phytel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, gaining valuable experience in early networked computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This exposure helped him understand not just how the technology worked, but also its practical implications for building applications, such as analyzing packet counts and hardware bandwidth for quantitative trading and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

In 1988, seeing the greater financial success of their customers in quantitative trading, Bezos transitioned into banking, joining the investment bank Bankers Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Bankers Trust later became part of Deutsche Bank through mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. During this period, Bezos, with an entrepreneurial inclination, became friends with Halsey Minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, with whom he almost started a financial newsletter startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Minor later went on to found CNET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, both riding the wave of distributing information over the budding World Wide Web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Journey to D. E. Shaw
In 1990, a headhunter convinced Bezos to interview at D. E. Shaw, a financial firm founded a couple of years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Bezos "completely falls in love" with the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

The founder, David E. Shaw, was a Stanford computer science PhD and a former Columbia computer science professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Shaw founded the firm in 1988, drawing inspiration from Jim Simons, who started Renaissance Technologies (RenTec) in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. RenTec's core Medallion fund, composed of private capital from its employees and Simons himself, averaged an astounding 66.1% annual return from 1988 to 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While D. E. Shaw did not match RenTec's performance, it became a legacy in the hedge fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

D. E. Shaw, although known as a quant hedge fund, resisted being defined solely by that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. They saw themselves as a group of "creative artisans" who invested in and started businesses, viewing the world through different lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Rise at D. E. Shaw and Internet Ventures
Bezos quickly ascended the ranks at D. E. Shaw, becoming the firm's fourth Senior Vice President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, and was by far the youngest at that level in his mid to late 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. He and David Shaw developed a very close relationship, with Shaw serving as a mentor to Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

Bezos was heavily involved in recruiting, adhering to the firm's philosophy of finding "the smartest people in the world" regardless of their business or finance knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Many future key early Amazon employees, including Jeff Holden and Nicholas Lovejoy, were recruited during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Notably, Bezos also recruited and later married MacKenzie Scott Tuttle, who would become [[jeff_bezos_and_mckenzie_bezos_financial_growth | McKenzie Bezos]], technically the first employee of Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. She was instrumental in setting up the business's operations, including accounting and legal matters, even before the first engineer was hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Bezos led various entrepreneurial projects within D. E. Shaw. His first major project was building out the "third market business," an idea to create a separate market from exchanges where retail investors could trade without incurring high commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This concept is considered a predecessor to modern dark pools and payment for order flow mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Recognizing the nascent but growing internet, David Shaw reassigned Bezos to focus on identifying and developing internet business opportunities within D. E. Shaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Given their backgrounds, both Shaw and Bezos, who had used the command-prompt-based internet in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, were excited about its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The first internet project they pursued together was an online retail brokerage for financial trading, aiming to compete with firms like E-Trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This project likely evolved from Bezos's earlier work on the third market business, as it made much more sense over the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

### Connecting the Dots: Amazon's Genesis
The deep dive into Bezos's early years, particularly his time at D. E. Shaw, is crucial for understanding Amazon's evolution. As with [[Steve Jobs | Steve Jobs]], one "can't connect the dots looking forward but when you look back through Jeff's past... it makes total sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. In many ways, Amazon is an extension of Jeff Bezos's brain, a company made in his image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For its first decade, Amazon was largely "Jeff Bezos at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Bezos often chuckled at the irony of starting a business leveraging the internet's ability to distribute hypertext, yet choosing to distribute physical booksâ€”an "abstraction layer" where words were printed on paper before being shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Despite the advancement of technology, even today, searching within books digitally remains a challenge due to publisher-imposed digital rights management (DRM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

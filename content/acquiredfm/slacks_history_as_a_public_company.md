Slack, initially positioned as a revolutionary chat platform for enterprises, has had a compelling yet tumultuous journey as a public company. Its tenure in the public markets was a rollercoaster defined by strategic decisions, market interpretations, and its eventual [[slacks_acquisition_by_salesforce | acquisition by Salesforce]].

## The Direct Listing and Market Perception

Slack went public through a direct listing in June 2019, a choice that sparked interest due to its unconventionality for such a high-profile tech company. The expectations riding on Slack's shoulders were profound, especially given its appeal to both startups and large organizations as a central hub for workplace communication.

Despite these expectations, Slack's stock has experienced significant volatility, struggling to meet its introductory day price throughout its time as a public entity. This time as a public company was often marked by the shadow of Microsoft's competing product, Teams. The narrative that Teams could potentially overshadow Slack contributed heavily to its subdued stock performance, despite strong underlying business metrics. This kind of direct competition is reminiscent of [[comparison_of_cloud_competitors_like_microsoft_and_google | competition in other tech arenas]].

## Operational Metrics and Market Dynamics

Slack, as a high-growth SaaS company, consistently reported strong operational metrics. It boasted top-tier gross margins, significant free cash flow improvements, and a growth trajectory that many saw as promising in the long term. For instance, just before the acquisition by Salesforce, Slack reported a quarterly revenue of $235 million, nearing an annual run rate of $1 billion [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">00:38:39</a>].

However, the narrative driven by external comparisons, especially to Microsoft Teams, cast a bearish outlook on Slack in the eyes of many market observers. This narrative overshadowed Slack's achievements, painting it as a company struggling to maintain relevance amidst the rise of alternative collaboration tools, reflecting broader [[comparisons_and_competition_with_other_tech_companies_like_apple_and_google | industry comparisons]].

## Strategic Acquisition by Salesforce

Slack's journey as a public company culminated in its acquisition by Salesforce for $27.7 billion. This acquisition, while offering a substantial premium to Slack's trading price at the time, reflected a strategic alignment where Salesforce aimed to bolster its competitive stance against Microsoft [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">00:07:01</a>]. From Salesforce's perspective, integrating Slack could enhance its own Customer 360 platform, offering a unified communication layer to its enterprise clients. This move aligns with [[salesforces_growth_strategy | Salesforce's growth strategy]] within the tech sector.

For Slack, the acquisition by Salesforce represented an opportunity to leverage Salesforce's robust distribution channels to reach a broader audienceâ€”a feat it struggled to achieve independently [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">01:00:39</a>]. Stewart Butterfield, Slack's co-founder and CEO, remained optimistic that this shift would allow the company to fulfill its long-term vision while navigating the competitive landscape more effectively as part of a larger entity, illustrating challenges similar to those found in [[challenges_and_advice_for_company_founders | strategies for company founders]].

## Conclusion

Slack's period as a public company was characterized by strong operational performance overshadowed by market narratives not entirely favorable to its growth story. Its eventual acquisition by Salesforce marked the end of its independent public journey but opened a new chapter within a larger ecosystem. Despite the challenges, Slack remains a significant player in enterprise communication, influenced by its strategic realignment under Salesforce, a move that may be essential in a tech landscape marked by fierce [[challenges_and_competition_in_the_payment_industry | competition among rivals]].

Mark to market (MTM) accounting is an accounting method that values assets and liabilities at their current market price, rather than their historical cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. This means that unrealized gains or losses are reflected on financial statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

## Enron's Adoption of Mark to Market

Jeff Skilling, a McKinsey consultant, made MTM accounting a non-negotiable condition for joining Enron as the CEO of its new finance division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. He considered it a "lay my body across the tracks issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. Enron became the first non-financial company to adopt this accounting method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.

Normally, for a business delivering gas, costs are accounted for when gas is delivered, and revenue is recognized when customers pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>. However, in a trading business, like stocks, the market value of everything bought and sold should be accounted for, even if not yet sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. Venture Capital firms famously use MTM, where an "up round" set by a third party allows them to account for increased value, even before cash is received from a liquidity event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.

### SEC Approval
Despite initial resistance from Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors, who viewed it as "very borderline" for an operating oil and gas company, Skilling successfully convinced the SEC to approve Enron's use of MTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. Skilling's intellectual purity and compelling arguments were instrumental in this approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. This was a puzzling approval, as the SEC had no direct financial conflict of interest, unlike Enron's auditors and lawyers who were paid substantial fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

## Exploitation and Abuse by Enron

Once MTM accounting was implemented, Enron exploited it to inflate revenues and hide losses.
*   **Inflated Revenue Recognition**: Enron would enter into deals with producers, inflating projections for future oil and gas production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. They would then immediately recognize 20 years of these forecasted cash flows as current revenue on their income statement, often with no associated expenses or immediate cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. This practice was enabled by the SEC, which allowed them to collapse 20 years of future cash flows into current revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>.
*   **Special Purpose Entities (SPEs)**: Enron used SPEs to offload assets that they didn't want on their books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>. These "phony sales" to SPEs, which Enron largely controlled (often owning 97% while only 3% of capital came from outside investors), allowed them to book additional revenue from the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>. This created a "double-dipping" effect where they recognized future cash flows from a project and then recognized more revenue from selling that project to an SPE they controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. All the while, little to no actual cash changed hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.
*   **Lack of Recurring Revenue**: A major flaw of this approach was that it front-loaded all future income into a single moment in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. This meant Enron had to constantly find new, bigger deals each year to show continued "growth" because previous deals yielded no future income statement benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. This created an unsustainable "House of Cards" that was destined to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>.

## Consequences and Regulatory Response

The manipulation of financial statements through MTM and SPEs allowed Enron to artificially inflate its stock price, attracting investors who were unaware of the underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. As long as the stock price rose, questions about profitability, free cash flow, and [[public_vs_private_market_investing | return on invested capital]] were overlooked due to the powerful incentives benefiting all parties involved, including investment bankers and analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

However, as the [[the_impact_of_market_evolution_on_investing | tech bubble]] burst in 2001 and the market tide went out, scrutiny increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Journalists and short sellers, such as Jim Chanos and Bethany McLean, began questioning Enron's opaque financial statements and lack of cash flow, despite reported high profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:57">[01:54:57]</a>. [[Investment Philosophy of Howard Marks and Andrew Marks | Andrew Marks]], guest on the show, notes that poor [[public_vs_private_market_investing | returns on invested capital]] and free cash flow alongside high revenue growth are indicators of potential fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:07">[01:55:07]</a>.

The eventual unravelling of Enron's fraud, including the "Raptor" SPEs that served as toxic hedges collateralized by Enron's own stock, highlighted the dangers of correlated risk and excessive financial leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:59">[03:05:59]</a>.

### Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
In response to Enron and other corporate scandals, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was signed into law in July 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:51">[02:37:51]</a>. SOX introduced several key reforms:
*   **CEO/CFO Certification**: Top management (CEO and CFO) are now required to certify the accuracy of financial information, increasing personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:54">[02:38:54]</a>.
*   **Penalties for Fraud**: More severe penalties were introduced for fraud and tampering with or destroying evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:05">[02:39:05]</a>.
*   **Auditor Independence**: Outside auditors must be more independent, requiring accounting firms to spin off their consulting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>.
*   **Increased Disclosures**: Public companies are now required to disclose all off-balance sheet entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:26">[02:39:26]</a>.

While SOX increased the cost and complexity of being a public company, potentially contributing to the "stay private longer" trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>, it also largely achieved its goal of protecting the public from corporate fraud in public markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:45">[02:41:45]</a>. However, this has shifted the landscape, making fraud more likely to occur in the [[public_vs_private_market_investing | private market]] or international quasi-domestic markets, as seen with Theranos and FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:56">[02:59:56]</a>.

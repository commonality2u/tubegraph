Electronic Design Automation (EDA) is the software used by chip designers to create complex integrated circuits. The field has evolved significantly, with much of the design complexity now embedded within the EDA software itself, enabling the creation of new types of chips that would otherwise be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. EDA serves as essential infrastructure behind the [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI era]] and the semiconductor innovation observed today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI applications]] would not be possible without EDA and the significant optimizations its software performs for chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Early Concepts of AI in EDA

Even at its inception, Synopsys utilized early forms of artificial intelligence. In the mid-1980s, when Synopsys was founded, they developed design tools, one of which was called Socrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This program could automatically design circuits, leading to results that were "astoundingly good" compared to manual design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This pioneering effort used what was referred to as an "expert system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. An expert system involved adding rules to improve circuit design, although it could become complex to manage as more rules were introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This capability, while limited, was "dramatically better than humans" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

The introduction of synthesis software marked a transition from "computer-aided design" (CAD) to "electronic design automation" (EDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Unlike CAD tools that merely assisted human designers, synthesis tools could actively change and optimize a circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Initially, designers were reluctant to trust tools that intervened in their workflow, fearing the introduction of bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

### Modern AI and Machine Learning in EDA

Synopsys began using [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI]] internally to design its own chip design software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. In 2018, Synopsys introduced [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI]] for synthesis and place & route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Initially, users showed resistance, wanting to understand every change the [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI]] made, even though the results were consistently better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This lack of trust persisted for about two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. However, [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI]] is now well-accepted in the EDA industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

The EDA world primarily focuses on "massive optimization problems," dealing with billions of transistors in tiny areas, optimizing for placement, routing, performance, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. This level of optimization is beyond human capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Synopsys utilizes [[machines_analyzing_data_for_decisionmaking | machine learning]] and [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI]] algorithms for this optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Unlike generative [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI]] which might be 90% accurate, EDA requires "absolute correctness in functionality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Designs undergo many verification steps before manufacturing to prevent costly errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

### Impact and Future

The integration of [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI]] in EDA, pioneered by Synopsys starting in 2017, is now used by dozens of customers in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. This technology works on an "unbelievable number of parameters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

The role of [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI]] and [[machines_analyzing_data_for_decisionmaking | machine learning]] is expanding beyond chip design to encompass broader system design and simulation, impacting various end markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI]] is seen as a "huge opportunity to disrupt every market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>.

Simulation, in general, is becoming increasingly important due to the complexity of modern systems and the need to predict behavior before physical testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. Accelerated compute, combined with [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | AI]] techniques, significantly speeds up simulation processes, making it possible to simulate more effectively and efficiently for a wider range of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>.

Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, shared his perspectives on the evolution of podcasting and audiobooks, Spotify's strategic decisions, and the broader creator economy.

## The Nature of Podcasting
Podcasting, as a medium, is impossible to flawlessly execute, yet its beauty lies in the organic conversations that emerge, often resulting in a product different from the initial vision but still great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. Unlike brief journalistic interviews, podcasts offer ample time for elaboration on thoughts and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">00:00:26</a>.

## Spotify's Foray into Podcasting and Audio
Spotify officially welcomed listeners to its podcast, "Acquired," which delves into the stories and playbooks of great technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">00:01:11</a>. Daniel Ek, "the man who saved the music industry," was featured, highlighting Spotify's significant impact:
*   Spotify has paid $40 billion to artists over its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">00:01:32</a>.
*   It is now the largest revenue source for the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">00:01:37</a>.
*   The platform boasts over 500 million monthly active listeners, with more than 200 million paid subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">00:01:41</a>.

Spotify's decision to dive into podcasting was a "seismic shift" in the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">00:01:46</a>. For the "Acquired" podcast, over 60% of their audience is now on Spotify, a significant increase from almost zero four years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">00:02:25</a>. This growth led the hosts to travel to Stockholm to record with Daniel Ek in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">00:02:37</a>.

### Serendipitous Beginnings for Audiobooks
Ek noted that Spotify's journey into audio was somewhat serendipitous, not stemming from a single "genius insight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">00:04:00</a>. A key realization came when music labels in Germany began uploading audiobooks to the platform, as they owned the rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">00:04:51</a>. This showed that users enjoyed consuming content regardless of its specific format, suggesting the platform's versatility beyond music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">00:05:17</a>.

### The "Same App" Strategy
Spotify employees, being big podcast listeners themselves, disliked having to switch apps and struggled with recommendations or device compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">00:05:28</a>. It became clear that podcasters faced similar problems to music creators, and Spotify's existing infrastructure for music—discovery, ubiquity (playing on any device), and the freemium model—could apply to podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">00:05:53</a>.

The most controversial decision was to build podcasts within the same app as music, going against the prevailing "constellation of apps" wisdom at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">00:06:27</a>. However, this allowed for a broader reach, as people not defining themselves as "podcast listeners" would be exposed to the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">00:06:52</a>. The success of this strategy, driven by observed user behavior and first principles thinking, made it "obvious" internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">00:07:13</a>.

### Blurring Lines Between Formats
Ek emphasized that the boundaries between audio formats are blurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">00:11:11</a>. For example, the "Acquired" podcast's long, deep-dive episodes feel more like "conversational audiobooks" than traditional podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">00:10:52</a>.

The primary distinction between audiobooks and podcasts, according to Ek, lies in their business model:
*   **Podcasting:** Predominantly ad-supported audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">00:11:26</a>.
*   **Audiobooks:** Typically paid audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">00:11:32</a>.

Ek believes audiobooks should become much larger, reaching hundreds of millions of listeners, by solving challenges related to business models and discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">00:13:17</a>. He likened the current audiobook market, with its one-off purchases or expensive subscriptions, to the music industry in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">00:13:51</a>. He advocates for a "freemium" model across all media, allowing creators to explore both ad-supported and paid content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">00:15:05</a>.

## Business Models and the Creator Economy
The [[partnership_dynamics_between_brands_and_podcasts | podcasting business model]] holds the potential for greater operating leverage compared to music streaming, where Spotify typically shares 70% of revenue with labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">00:18:01</a>. While contemplating the business side from the outset was crucial for substantial investments, Ek noted that self-owned content models come with their own challenges, such as:
*   **Content moderation:** A significant variable cost (e.g., Meta had over 100,000 content moderators at one point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">00:20:03</a>.
*   **Building an ad network:** Requires scale and sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">00:20:06</a>.

Spotify had a large ad-supported tier (150-200 million users) when it launched podcasting, giving it an advantage in monetization for creators, especially those at "sub-scale" who cannot directly access large advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">00:23:41</a>.

### Creator Challenges and Opportunities
Ek identified attribution as a major problem in the new creator economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">00:31:38</a>. Creators often over- or under-invest in different platforms due to a lack of understanding about what truly drives growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">00:32:02</a>. He advised diversifying presence to avoid vulnerability to algorithm changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">00:32:12</a>.

The **Spotify home feed** was designed to merchandise content differently for music versus podcasts/audiobooks, acknowledging that a song is a 3-minute commitment, while a podcast requires a much larger time investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">00:33:08</a>. Trust and rapport with a creator become crucial for longer content engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">00:34:07</a>.

Spotify's goal is to be the best partner for creators, offering low-friction ways to monetize and customize their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">01:15:04</a>. This contrasts with platforms like Twitter, where direct monetization for creators is not standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">01:14:35</a>. The future will likely see more options for creators beyond binary on/off monetization models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">01:18:06</a>.

Ek noted that the music industry is healthier than ever due to streaming, despite big artists earning less from streaming than from CD sales in their heyday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">01:22:09</a>. This necessitates creators figuring out a new "constellation of revenue streams" (e.g., live events, merchandise, additional businesses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">01:21:57</a>.

## Global Cultural Trends and AI's Impact
Ek observed a broader trend of global culture, where niche genres can develop into significant global phenomena, as seen with reggaeton (e.g., Bad Bunny) and K-Pop (e.g., BTS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">00:49:26</a>. These artists demonstrate how culture can transcend language barriers and resonate deeply with diverse audiences globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">00:52:06</a>.

Regarding [[Podcast_production_and_content_creation | audio podcast and YouTube channel content]], Ek believes AI will dramatically lower the barrier to entry for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">01:03:08</a>. He shared a personal anecdote of using ChatGPT to quickly set up a coding environment after a decade away, highlighting AI's potential to simplify complex workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">01:03:51</a>. While millions already record music, hundreds of millions play instruments, and AI could enable more of them to create professional-sounding content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">01:05:05</a>.

However, the rise of AI-generated content also raises concerns about authenticity. Platforms like Spotify will need to play a role in verifying that content was created by the original creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">01:13:14</a>. Ek also mentioned Spotify's AI DJ feature as an example of a high-quality AI product that is seeing significant reach and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:55">01:30:55</a>.

## Spotify's Growth Strategy and Culture
Spotify's [[history_and_growth_of_the_acquired_podcast | history and growth]] has involved "stacking S-curves" on top of each other, meaning intentionally changing strategies to acquire each new segment of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:36">01:26:36</a>. This means that if you "zoom in on that exponential curve it actually is like a lot of different linear curves stacked on top of each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">01:17:10</a>.

Ek emphasized the importance of **intentional culture building** for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">01:27:40</a>. He noted that many companies, including early Spotify, inadvertently adopt parts of other successful cultures, leading to a "Frankenstein monster" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">01:31:34</a>. The key is to be deliberate about what culture you are building and to iterate and improve on it, rather than just copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">01:29:47</a>.

Spotify has a culture of "happily releasing something that's not great" with the right strategy, then iterating to make it great (e.g., early podcasting, audiobooks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">01:30:26</a>. This contrasts with a culture of only releasing perfect products. Understanding when to apply each approach is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:22">01:32:22</a>. Being outside of Silicon Valley in its early years allowed Spotify to develop its distinct culture from first principles rather than through "osmosis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">01:34:30</a>.

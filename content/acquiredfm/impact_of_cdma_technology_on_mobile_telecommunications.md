[[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA technology and its impact]] has been a foundational element in the development of modern mobile telecommunications, leading to significant market dominance and financial success for companies like Qualcomm.

## Early Adoption and Market Dominance (2G Era)

[[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] was adopted as a major 2G standard for the subsequent generation of phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Its market penetration was substantial:
*   In the U.S., [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] achieved 57% market share in the 2G space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   In countries like South Korea, it commanded a 100% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] also secured a massive market share in China, as the country began adopting mobile technology for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The first [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] networks went live in the U.S. and internationally in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Financial and Business Impact

The strategic decision to focus on [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] technology was pivotal for Qualcomm. Today, 85% of Qualcomm's revenue, primarily from its semiconductor business, would not exist without this decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Qualcomm currently stands as the largest fabless semiconductor company globally, surpassing Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Qualcomm's revenue saw rapid growth in the early years of [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] adoption:
*   1995: $383 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   1996: $814 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

Despite this growth, Wall Street initially viewed Qualcomm's stock unfavorably because the capital-intensive manufacturing operations and joint ventures tied up all the company's profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The stock remained largely flat until January 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Strategic Shift in 1999
In 1999, Qualcomm made significant strategic changes to its business model:
*   **Infrastructure Business Sale:** In March 1999, Qualcomm sold its infrastructure business (base stations) to Ericsson, previously a competitor. This was part of a settlement deal resolving various lawsuits between the two companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This move allowed Qualcomm to shed capital-intensive manufacturing operations that were draining free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Mobile Phone Business Sale:** In December 1999, Qualcomm sold its mobile phone business to Kyocera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

These divestitures transitioned Qualcomm into a model focused on selling semiconductor designs (QTC - Qualcomm [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] Technologies Group) and licensing patents (QTL - Qualcomm Technology Licensing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This new model emphasized high-margin revenue from licenses to its patent portfolio and high-margin semiconductor designs, as they did not fabricate the semiconductors themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Stock Performance in 2000
Following the strategic shifts, Qualcomm's stock experienced an extraordinary surge. In the year 2000, during the height of the tech bubble, Qualcomm was the single best-performing stock, appreciating by 2621% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This represented a 26.2x return in the public markets in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Evolution into 3G and Beyond

### 3G and CDMA's Continued Dominance
The next generation of cell phone networks, 3G, was characterized by an industry debate between GSM and [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] standards, especially in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Ultimately, virtually all 3G networks adopted [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] technology worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

This widespread adoption was due to [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]]'s vastly superior performance for data speeds and broadband internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Since most data (website downloads, iMessages, tweets) is digital information, it lent itself perfectly to [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]]'s digital-centric infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Leadership Transition and 4G Preparation
In 2005, Irwin Jacobs retired as CEO of Qualcomm, and his son, Paul Jacobs, who held a PhD in electrical engineering and had spent his entire career at Qualcomm, took over as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Also in 2005, Qualcomm acquired Flarion Technologies for $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Flarion held numerous patents that would become essential for 4G technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This acquisition was seen as a way to "refill the pot of missiles" (patents) that Qualcomm could use to maintain its licensing business model for future generations of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

While [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] was a significant advancement, it was a 20-year-old technology by 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. 4G would largely be based on OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing), which was more efficient than [[cdma_technology_and_its_impact | CDMA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Although Qualcomm initially resisted OFDMA, the Flarion acquisition and subsequent pivot allowed them to continue their business model by owning many of the patents required for 4G and LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### The Smartphone Era and Snapdragon
Under Paul Jacobs' leadership (2005-2013/2014), Qualcomm began building the Snapdragon line of mobile Systems-on-a-Chip (SoCs) and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. This positioned them well for the modern smartphone era, as Snapdragon became the dominant high-end chip for Android phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Qualcomm now earns an average of about $20 for every smartphone sold worldwide, including Apple iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## Litigation and Value Capture
Around 2009, Qualcomm's reputation began to shift. While recognized as pioneers and true inventors who reinvest a significant portion of revenue into R&D, they also became known as "value capture pioneers" due to their aggressive patent licensing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This led to significant litigation, including lawsuits from companies like Apple and antitrust challenges from the FTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

> [Qualcomm] make them sound so evil. I mean, they did invent it all so they do have a right to monetize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
> The FTC sued them for Anti-Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Costco's private label, Kirkland Signature, is a cornerstone of its business model, renowned for its quality and value, and holding a significant place in global retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It is considered one of the largest consumer package brands in the world by revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Origin and Philosophy
The concept of a house brand at Costco has roots in its predecessor, FedMart, which developed its own "FM brand" for popular products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. The modern Kirkland Signature brand was created around the time of the Costco-Price Club merger in the mid-to-late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:45">[01:33:45]</a>. The name "Kirkland Signature" originated from Costco's corporate headquarters being located in Kirkland, Washington at the time of the brand's inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>.

The philosophy behind Kirkland Signature is to offer products of a certain bar of quality that are sufficient for Costco members, often at a lower price than comparable branded items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. It's an opportunity for Costco to create value for members, rather than solely to capture more margin for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:15">[01:36:15]</a>. This contrasts with other retailers that use house brands primarily for higher profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>. While most products sold at Costco have a strict maximum markup of 14% over their supplier cost, Kirkland Signature items have a slightly higher allowance, up to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>.

Kirkland Signature benefits from Costco's strategy of maintaining a very low SKU count (Stock Keeping Unit), typically around 3,800 different items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. This limits competition on the shelves within product categories, often presenting Kirkland as one of only two or three, or even the sole, option for a given product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>.

## Scale and Impact
The scale of Kirkland Signature is immense. It generated $52 billion in sales annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>, which even without including Kirkland Signature gas, surpasses the total revenue of Nike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This makes Kirkland Signature the largest consumer package brand by revenue in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Kirkland Signature sales account for nearly a quarter of Costco's total top-line revenue of $230 billion, and closer to a third if including gas sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:51">[01:37:51]</a>.

Examples of Kirkland Signature's reach and impact include:
*   **Wine and Liquor** Consumers often praise Kirkland Signature wines and spirits, noting their quality despite the low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:40">[01:35:40]</a>.
*   **Batteries** Kirkland Signature batteries are recognized as being made by reputable manufacturers, ensuring quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>.
*   **Mixed Nuts** Costco's buyers work directly with farmers and suppliers to "clean up the supply chain" and offer high-quality products like their fancy mixed nuts at a better price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:20">[02:30:20]</a>. Costco sells one-third of the world's jumbo cashews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:37">[02:32:37]</a>.
*   **Rotisserie Chickens** Costco made the strategic decision to vertically integrate its chicken processing, building its own facility in Fremont, Nebraska, and working with local farmers to control quality and pricing. This ensures a consistent supply of value-priced chickens, 130 million of which are sold as rotisserie chickens annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:32">[02:27:32]</a>.
*   **Hot Dogs** The famous $1.50 hot dog and soda combo, while not explicitly Kirkland Signature, highlights Costco's commitment to loss leaders that drive traffic and reinforce their value proposition, stemming from the early days of Price Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The widespread success of Kirkland Signature has, somewhat unintentionally, turned it into a recognizable brand that consumers associate with a certain level of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>. This unique "anti-brand" identity fuels a passionate following and contributes to Costco's "earned media" through social media, such as TikTok, where members constantly share their finds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:22">[02:17:22]</a>.

Windows 95, codenamed "Chicago" during its development, aimed to create an operating system for the "every man" â€“ one that was easy to use and offered a high quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:40">[03:16:40]</a>. This code name stood in contrast to other ambitious, far-flung internal projects like "Cairo," which never shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:51">[03:17:51]</a>.

## Origins and Development

Microsoft had been hedging its bets in the operating system space. While the company was officially all-in on [[microsofts_partnership_with_ibm_and_development_of_msdos | IBM's]] OS/2 vision, a smaller, less prestigious team, often seen as "misfits," was working on Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a>. Windows 1.0, released in November 1985, was considered a "half step" between a command-line interface and a true graphical user interface (GUI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:39">[02:38:39]</a>. It featured tiled, non-overlapping windows and only achieved 5% penetration of the [[microsofts_partnership_with_ibm_and_development_of_msdos | DOS]] installed base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>.

The situation changed dramatically with Windows 3.0, released in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:45">[02:48:45]</a>. This version was unexpectedly loved and doubled its penetration in the first six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:17">[02:49:17]</a>. The success of Windows 3.0, and the subsequent 3.1, led to a pivotal decision by Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer to bet the company on Windows, shifting it from Plan B to Plan A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>. This marked a moment where Microsoft internally began to truly believe in their self-direction, rather than being dictated by partners like [[microsofts_partnership_with_ibm_and_development_of_msdos | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:03">[02:53:03]</a>.

## Technical Aspects

Windows 95 represented a significant technical leap. While earlier versions were often described as graphical environments running *on top* of [[microsofts_partnership_with_ibm_and_development_of_msdos | MS-DOS]], Windows 95 itself was a true 32-bit operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:31">[03:28:31]</a>. It performed its own "heavy lifting" and had its own file system, though it could still use [[microsofts_partnership_with_ibm_and_development_of_msdos | DOS]] in fallback situations for older applications or drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:12">[03:28:12]</a>. This change was reflected in marketing, which transitioned from "operating environment" to "operating system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:49">[03:28:49]</a>.

Key innovations included true multitasking and a refined GUI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>. The iconic Start Menu, a new feature, was widely appealing, simplifying how users interacted with their computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## The Global Launch Event

The launch of Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, was a massive, ridiculous, and insane day in Redmond, Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:05">[03:18:05]</a>. Microsoft set up tents, flew in journalists, and created a movement around the operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:09">[03:18:09]</a>. Jay Leno co-hosted the tightly scripted 90-minute launch event with Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:30">[03:18:30]</a>. The Rolling Stones' "Start Me Up" was famously licensed as the official theme song, a testament to the unprecedented scale of the marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:14">[03:19:14]</a>.

It was an "unabashed celebration of software," marking a peak moment of pure joy in technology before widespread skepticism and legal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:08">[03:19:08]</a>. Across the world, people lined up around the block to buy the operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:41">[03:20:41]</a>. Landmarks like the CN Tower and the Tower of London were lit up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:49">[03:20:49]</a>. The marketing was so successful that Coca-Cola, known for its iconic campaigns, reached out to Microsoft to learn their strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:06">[03:21:06]</a>. Windows 95 was launched concurrently worldwide in eight languages, continuing Microsoft's early commitment to internationalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:30">[03:21:30]</a>.

## Market Impact and Success

Windows 95 quickly became a commercial success, selling a million copies in its first week and 7 million in its first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:46">[03:26:46]</a>. This monumental launch was supported by an installed base of 75 million Windows users even before the release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>.

Financially, the impact was immediate and substantial. In fiscal year 1995 (ending June, before the launch), Microsoft had $5.9 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:56">[03:26:56]</a>. This jumped to $8.7 billion in fiscal 1996 and $12 billion in fiscal 1997, making Microsoft the first software company to surpass $10 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:02">[03:27:02]</a>.

By January 1993, Microsoft had already surpassed [[microsofts_partnership_with_ibm_and_development_of_msdos | IBM]] in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:43">[02:55:43]</a>. The success of Windows 95 cemented Windows as Microsoft's flagship product, a position it would hold for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:21">[03:26:21]</a>.

## Comparison with Mac

While the Mac pioneered many GUI elements, it operated on a much smaller scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:27">[03:22:27]</a>. Apple's strategy of being completely integrated (hardware and software) led to a better computing experience for some users, but it did not scale to the same mass market as Microsoft's model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:28">[03:24:28]</a>. Microsoft's approach of focusing on software and distributing it across many OEMs allowed them to achieve massive scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:48">[03:24:48]</a>.

Microsoft also learned from competitors. For example, while their own Multiplan spreadsheet failed to outperform Lotus 1-2-3 in the [[microsofts_partnership_with_ibm_and_development_of_msdos | DOS]] era, Microsoft's Excel for Mac (the world's first graphical spreadsheet program) was positioned to win on the new GUI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:39">[02:27:39]</a>. Excel also incorporated features and keyboard shortcuts from Lotus 1-2-3 to ease the transition for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:52">[03:50:52]</a>. This strategy of being "not first to market" but excelling at learning and adapting, along with strong distribution through OEMs, was a key factor in their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:19">[03:51:19]</a>.

Microsoft's ability to capitalize on the "zero marginal cost of software" and the massive secular growth of the personal computer market, combined with their position as the "choke point" for the entire industry, allowed them to achieve unprecedented success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:13">[03:40:13]</a>.

YC Continuity is a multi-stage fund at Y Combinator (YC) that primarily focuses on growth-stage investments, specifically Series B and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. It functions as an extended support system for YC-backed companies beyond their initial accelerator phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

## Formation and Mission

YC Continuity was launched in July 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. The idea originated from YC alumni founders who expressed a desire for YC to continue supporting them with investments and programs beyond the 12-week accelerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. At the time, the median time to IPO was 11 years, and there were fewer than 10 funds capable of writing $100 million-plus checks, creating a supply-demand imbalance for growth capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. YC's overarching mission is to help more founders start companies and build enduring businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.

YC founders view YC as a "parent," not merely an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. This means they often first approach their YC partner with urgent issues, even years after graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>. YC Continuity aims to [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | earn the right to win]] investments by prioritizing the success of YC companies over fund returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.

## Structure and Operations

YC Continuity operates as a multi-stage fund within YC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. It is run by managing partners Anu Hariharan and Ali Rowghani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Investment decisions are made by a three-person investment committee, consisting of Hariharan, Rowghani, and one early-stage YC partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.

The fund is not a high-velocity investor, having made only 35 investments in seven years, which is less than one percent of the 3,500 companies that have gone through YC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>. This is partly because Continuity was initially a "startup within YC," honing its investment strategy, and has historically been undercapitalized relative to the success of YC companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

YC Continuity invests globally, with investments in India, London, Latin America, and the Middle East, reflecting YC's mission to enable entrepreneurship worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

Initially, YC was self-funded by its founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. As investment amounts grew (from $20,000 per batch initially to $100,000-$125,000 for founders to live in Mountain View), YC brought in external Limited Partners (LPs), primarily university endowments, to fund its early-stage and late-stage funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>.

## Post-Batch Programming

Beyond capital, YC Continuity provides extensive post-batch programming, offering 10 times more support today than in 2012 or 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. Programs include:
*   **Series A Program** Helps companies prepare to raise Series A funding, including pitch decks, term sheet negotiation, and investor identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.
*   **Post-A Program** A six-week program that re-batches companies to provide new peer groups and brings in [[insights_into_investing_and_business_development | scale founders]] to teach topics like recruiting, hiring engineers, and adapting to changes in a CEO's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
*   **Growth Program** An eight-week program focused on how to scale as a CEO, covering hiring executives, performance management, and culture. Scale founders and executives from successful YC companies like DoorDash's CEO Tony Xu teach these sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

The YC community largely operates on WhatsApp, facilitating communication and support among founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>.

## YC's "University Model"

YC is often compared to a university for startups, with the accelerator as the undergraduate program and Continuity as the graduate school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. YC accepts applications without requiring personal connections, was the first to mass-produce investments in batches, and believes in the power of group settings to motivate founders and facilitate learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

Despite its scale (around 400 companies per batch, akin to a liberal arts college), YC's acceptance rate remains below three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. YC aims to keep the bar high by ensuring founders are working on the right problems with unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>. This approach has allowed YC to provide opportunities to founders who might not have had a chance elsewhere, as seen with companies like Airbnb, Coinbase, and DoorDash, which faced skepticism early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>.

## YC's Power and Competitive Advantage

YC's primary power and competitive advantage lies in its ability to assess founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. They possess extensive data and pattern recognition, enabling them to identify promising founders, often within the first two minutes of a 10-minute interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

At the growth stage, YC Continuity focuses on three key founder qualities as [[longterm_qualitative_judgments_in_venture_capital | leading indicators]] for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>:
1.  **Speed and Iteration:** How fast founders ship, iterate, and learn from early decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.
2.  **Hiring Ability:** The founder's effectiveness in hiring engineers and convincing incredible executives to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.
3.  **Clarity of Thought:** The ability to articulate a clear vision for the company's path to becoming a multi-billion dollar business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.

This approach means [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | YC invests based on inputs]] rather than solely on trailing metrics, believing that if these inputs are strong, the business results will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. They also leverage the collective knowledge of their successful alumni to teach best practices and influence company building, providing invaluable "color" that is hard to obtain outside YC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

## Future Outlook

In an A+ scenario, YC aims to be a lifelong partner to its companies, with Continuity further strengthening the YC community through comprehensive programs extending even to pre-IPO stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>. YC's ambition is to scale to support 1,000-2,000 companies per batch in the future, especially as the remote world demonstrates that talent and companies can emerge from anywhere globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:34">[01:22:34]</a>.

However, the biggest risk, or "F scenario," for YC would be to "mess up the YC community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>. YC's strength lies in its strong network effects and community values, and any mistake with the community could cause its power to decelerate quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>.

From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Nike, founded by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, has a rich and complex history, evolving from a small-scale shoe distribution company to the world's largest apparel business outside of the luxury sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The company currently generates over $50 billion in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. A central question in understanding Nike's success is whether it was driven more by breakthrough product innovation or profound marketing and brand positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Foundational Narratives

Much of Nike's early [[pelotons_history_and_founding_narrative | history and founding narrative]] is chronicled in several key books:
*   *Shoe Dog* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
*   *Just Do It* by journalist Donald Katz (who later founded Audible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   *Swoosh* by JB Strasser (wife of Rob Strasser, Nike's first head of marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

### The Co-Founders: Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight

**Bill Bowerman**
Bill Bowerman became the head track coach at the University of Oregon in July 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Described as a legendary, eccentric figure, he was a World War II major who even negotiated a German battalion's stand down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. He was known for extreme measures, once rigging his mailbox with explosives to deter mail carriers who kept knocking it over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Bowerman became arguably the most successful track coach in American history, coaching the first American sub-four-minute milers and several Olympic teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. He was innovative, focusing on rest for his runners and teaching himself to be a cobbler to modify and build athletic shoes for his athletes, using them as "guinea pigs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. His experiments included using exotic materials like snakeskin, deer hide, or fish skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

**Phil Knight**
Phil Knight was a middle-distance runner recruited by Bowerman to the University of Oregon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The son of a well-known University of Oregon alum and newspaper publisher, Phil majored in journalism and was an "okay" runner, despite running a 4-minute, 13-second mile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. He is characterized as one of the most introverted CEOs covered by Acquired, yet possessed an "unbelievably driven" and competitive spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This competitive drive became a founding element of Nike's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### The Genesis of Blue Ribbon Sports

After graduating from Oregon, Phil Knight attended Stanford Business School, graduating in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. In his final term, he wrote a business plan for what would become Blue Ribbon Sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. His thesis was inspired by the Japanese camera market, where companies like Nikon were undercutting German giants like Leica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. He saw a similar opportunity in the athletic goods market, dominated by German companies like Adidas and Puma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. At the time, the market for running shoes was small, and American companies like Converse were stuck in the canvas shoe era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

The **Adidas** (founded by Adolf "Adi" Dassler) and **Puma** (founded by Adi's brother Rudy Dassler) brands emerged from a bitter family feud after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Adi Dassler was known for making track cleats for Olympians, notably Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

In 1963, Phil Knight traveled to Japan and discovered the Tiger brand shoes, made by Onitsuka in Kobe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. On a whim, he visited their office and presented himself as an American businessman with a company called "Blue Ribbon Sports," seeking to import their shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. The name "Blue Ribbon Sports" allegedly came from his childhood track ribbons, though another story suggests it was inspired by a Japanese whiskey brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Knight exaggerated the potential US market for running shoes, claiming it could be $1 billion (it was actually much smaller, perhaps $100-200 million, but would later grow to $130 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

Onitsuka agreed to send samples, which arrived almost a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. Phil Knight secured a deal to be the distributor for the Western United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. He quit his accounting job, started selling shoes out of his car at track meets, and hired his first full-time employee, Jeff Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. Johnson was a key figure, evangelizing the brand, designing shoes, and setting up retail and manufacturing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. At the time, running was not a popular activity; runners were often mocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.

### Early Growth and Challenges

Blue Ribbon Sports generated $8,000 in revenue in 1964, doubling to $16,000 in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. However, the profit margins were very thin (around $1.75-$2 per pair after commissions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>, making it difficult to finance inventory for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

Phil Knight approached Bowerman for a partnership, and Bowerman, who had previously tried to work directly with Adidas to improve shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>, agreed to a 49% stake in Blue Ribbon Sports in exchange for $500 and his expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. This partnership was crucial, as Bowerman's reputation and innovative drive were significant assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

The company faced constant financial struggles, as traditional banks in Portland were risk-averse and only loaned based on book value (assets minus liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. Phil Knight's philosophy was "life is growth, business is growth, you grow or you die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>, often pushing the company's debt-to-assets ratio to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. This constant pressure to grow to avoid collapse ingrained growth as a core necessity in Nike's DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>.

Phil Knight eventually taught accounting at Portland State, where he met Penny Parks (who became his wife) and **Carolyn Davidson**, an art student he hired for $2 an hour to do design work for brochures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

### Innovation and the Birth of the Nike Brand

In 1967, Bowerman developed an idea for a running shoe with breathable nylon uppers, a significant innovation over leather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. Onitsuka was receptive, leading to the creation of the **Cortez** shoe, initially named "Aztec" until Adidas revealed their "Azteca Gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. The Cortez became a major hit and remains a lifestyle shoe today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

Also in 1967, Bowerman published a book called *Jogging: A Physical Fitness Program for All Ages*, inspired by a trip to New Zealand where he discovered the concept of jogging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. This book and a subsequent *Life* magazine profile of Bowerman and his jogging clubs are credited with starting the fitness movement in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. Nike was at the forefront of this wave, benefiting from and contributing to its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. The character Forrest Gump famously wore Nike Cortezes while running across America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

By 1970, Blue Ribbon Sports had grown to over half a million dollars in annual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. However, their relationship with Onitsuka became strained, especially as Onitsuka started exploring other US distributors and offered to buy out Blue Ribbon Sports at book value (effectively zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. Phil Knight secretly began exploring other manufacturing options.

In 1971, Knight learned about Japanese trading companies and secured financing from **Nisho Iwai** (now Sojitz, a $40 billion company today), which offered to finance all of Blue Ribbon's inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. This relationship was crucial, as Nisho Iwai could also connect Blue Ribbon with direct manufacturing relationships in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>. Onitsuka, realizing this threatened their position, opposed the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

The split with Onitsuka led to Blue Ribbon Sports seeking to manufacture their own shoes. They needed a logo for soccer cleats to be produced in Mexico. Phil Knight tasked Carolyn Davidson with designing a mark similar to Adidas's stripes. She created the **swoosh** for just $35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. Phil famously said, "I don't love it, but maybe it'll grow on me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. Years later, she received 500 shares of company stock, now worth over $7 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

The name **Nike** came from Jeff Johnson, who suggested it in a dream, referring to the Greek goddess of victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>. This was initially intended to be the model name for a football cleat, not the company name, and importantly, it was conceived *after* the swoosh design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>. The first "Nike" branded shoes were football cleats made in Mexico that cracked in cold weather, an inauspicious start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

After securing financing from Nisho Iwai and ending the Onitsuka relationship, Blue Ribbon Sports partnered with the Nippon Rubber Factory in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>. This factory could quickly replicate existing shoes and produce various models, including the Wimbledon, Forest Hill, Blazer, Bruin, and Marathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>. Phil Knight also famously requested bright orange boxes for the shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08">[01:28:08]</a>. Nike Inc. was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Ribbon Sports in 1971 to handle manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:42">[01:28:42]</a>.

Bowerman's next innovation was the **Waffle Trainer**, inspired by pouring polyurethane into his wife's waffle iron (which he ruined and is now a historical artifact at Nike) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. The waffle sole provided incredible grip on artificial surfaces, leading to early success with the University of Oregon football team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:35">[01:32:35]</a>. The Waffle Trainer became Nike's first big hit and hinted at the future of lifestyle sneakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

In 1972, Blue Ribbon's first full year selling Nike's own shoes, they achieved $3.2 million in revenue, a significant leap from half a million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>.

## The Nike Playbook Emerges

Nike's early playbook developed through several key strategies:

1.  **Inventing Sports Marketing:** Beyond initial sponsorships, Nike employed Steve Prefontaine (a legendary runner holding multiple American records) as "National Director of Public Affairs" for $5,000/year, allowing him to wear Nike shoes while maintaining amateur status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a>. This was described as "perfect results count, not a perfect process. Break the rules, fight the law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:45">[01:38:45]</a>.

2.  **The Futures Program:** To solve financing issues, Phil Knight introduced the "Futures program" in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:36">[01:39:36]</a>. Retailers would receive a 7% discount if they committed and paid for orders six months in advance, effectively shifting financing from banks to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:15">[01:40:15]</a>. This solidified Nike's strategy as a wholesaler for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

3.  **Global Outsourcing of Manufacturing:** As the Japanese economy grew and the yen's value fluctuated, Nike expanded manufacturing to Taiwan, South Korea, China, Indonesia, and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a>. This allowed for cheaper production, though it later led to significant [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_nike | challenges and controversies faced by Nike]] regarding labor practices (e.g., child labor, toxic glues) in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:54">[01:43:54]</a>. Nike initially mishandled these accusations by claiming they didn't make shoes, but later worked to clean up their act by implementing new standards, publishing supplier lists, and investing in non-toxic glues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:21">[01:45:21]</a>.

In 1974, with "limiters off," Nike's revenue soared to $8 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:44">[01:48:44]</a>. They also won their legal battle against Onitsuka, which was ordered to pay Blue Ribbon $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:02">[01:49:02]</a>. This legal victory brought **Rob Strasser** (played by Jason Bateman in the movie "Air") into Nike's orbit as their lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:27">[01:49:27]</a>.

Strasser, an imposing figure nicknamed "Rolling Thunder," quickly became Nike's head of marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:25">[01:50:25]</a>. He systematically expanded athlete sponsorships, signing "half the NBA" for minimal cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:13">[01:51:13]</a>. He also hired Sonny Vaccaro to build the college basketball program, signing coaches at major schools like UNLV, Georgetown, and Texas to be "Nike coaches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:55">[01:51:55]</a>. This cemented Nike's [[nikes_business_and_marketing_strategy | business and marketing strategy]] of using athlete endorsements as "billboards" to build brand recognition, rather than just selling specific sports shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:17">[01:54:17]</a>.

In 1977, Nike officially changed its name from Blue Ribbon Sports to Nike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>. They also brought in **Frank Rudy**, a former NASA engineer and inventor of **Air Sole technology** (the literal nitrogen airbag in shoe midsoles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:06">[01:58:06]</a>. Phil Knight was initially skeptical but was won over when he learned Adidas had rejected the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:27">[01:58:27]</a>. Rudy received royalties for each Air Sole shoe sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:24">[01:59:24]</a>.

Around this time, Rob Strasser, frustrated by internal dynamics, famously typed and distributed the **"Nike Principles"** memo in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>. These 10 principles included:
1.  Our business is change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:11">[02:00:11]</a>
2.  We are on offense all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:41">[02:00:41]</a>
3.  Perfect results count, not a perfect process. Break the rules, fight the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:45">[02:00:45]</a>
4.  This is as much about battle as about business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:53">[02:00:53]</a>
5.  Assume nothing. Make sure people keep their promises. Push yourselves, push others. Stretch the possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:56">[02:00:56]</a>
6.  Live off the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>
7.  Your job isn't done until the job is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:06">[02:01:06]</a>
8.  Dangers: bureaucracy, personal ambition, energy takers vs. energy givers, knowing our weaknesses, don't get too many things on the platter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:13">[02:01:13]</a>
9.  It won't be pretty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:23">[02:01:23]</a>
10. If we do the right things, we'll make money damn near automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>

These principles reflected Nike's aggressive, competitive culture and its emphasis on growth as a necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:53">[02:05:53]</a>.

## The Michael Jordan Era and Beyond

By 1979, Nike's sales reached $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:37">[02:07:37]</a>. In December 1980, Nike went public, the same week as Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:48">[02:07:48]</a>. Its market cap was around $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a>, and Phil Knight, who owned 46% of the company, became one of the richest people in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:35">[02:08:35]</a>.

Following the IPO, Nike experienced a downturn. Phil Knight went on sabbatical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:20">[02:09:20]</a>, and the company largely missed the broader fitness boom, focusing too heavily on running while aerobics gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>. Reebok, founded in 1980, capitalized on the aerobics fad and eclipsed Nike in sales by 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:54">[02:10:54]</a>.

In 1984, facing challenges, Nike signed a young basketball player from North Carolina, **Michael Jordan**, then the third pick in the NBA draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:40">[02:14:40]</a>. The deal, spearheaded by Rob Strasser, was revolutionary: a $2.5 million minimum guaranteed payout over five years, but more importantly, a 5% royalty on gross revenue from Air Jordan sales (shoes and merchandise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:57">[02:17:57]</a>. Unlike Converse's deals with stars like Magic Johnson and Larry Bird ($100,000/year), Nike created a signature shoe for Jordan and offered him a share of the upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:50]</a>. Jordan also received royalties on incremental sales across the entire Nike basketball line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:08">[02:20:08]</a>.

Jordan initially preferred Adidas, but their offer couldn't compare to Nike's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>. In its first year, the **Air Jordan 1** sold $126 million, far exceeding the goal of $3 million over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Jordan earned $6.3 million from Nike in 1985, matching his entire seven-year Bulls contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>.

The success was fueled by a marketing stunt: the NBA banned Jordan's black and red Air Jordan 1s (prototypes known as "Breds") for violating uniform rules, and Nike created a famous commercial implying the shoes were "banned" for being too good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:37">[02:28:37]</a>. This created massive demand and buzz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:50">[02:29:50]</a>.

However, Nike also "stuffed the channel" in the first year, leading to a hangover in years two and three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:30">[02:31:30]</a>. Sales dipped, compounded by Jordan's foot injury and the unpopular, stiff **Air Jordan 2s** (made in Italy from premium leather, priced at $100 compared to the AJ1's $65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:48">[02:32:48]</a>.

During this period, Rob Strasser's relationship with Phil Knight deteriorated. Strasser, alongside designer Peter Moore, became increasingly rogue, leading a new "new products division" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:47">[02:33:47]</a>. In 1987, after a major conflict, Strasser left Nike with Moore and eventually became CEO of Adidas America, an "intolerable betrayal" for Phil Knight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:35">[02:35:35]</a>. Tragically, Strasser died eight months later at age 46 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:40">[02:35:40]</a>.

Jordan was unhappy with Strasser's departure and considered leaving Nike. To retain him, Nike's design group, led by **Tinker Hatfield** (an architect and former Bowerman runner) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:58">[02:38:58]</a>, developed the **Air Jordan 3** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:51">[02:40:51]</a>. Hatfield met directly with Jordan, incorporating his feedback for a softer, mid-cut shoe with elephant print leather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:46">[02:39:46]</a>. Crucially, the Air Jordan 3 notably featured the **Jumpman logo** on the tongue instead of the swoosh, a concession to keep Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:24">[02:41:24]</a>.

This led to a renegotiated deal for Jordan, extending his contract for seven more years with a higher guarantee ($18 million) and solidifying the **Jordan brand** as its own sub-segment within Nike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:26">[02:42:26]</a>. The Jordan brand has grown exponentially, reaching $6.6 billion in revenue in FY22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:25">[02:45:25]</a>, with Michael Jordan earning over $300 million annually from royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:35">[02:45:35]</a>. This success was amplified by the rise of ESPN and SportsCenter, providing constant visibility for athletes like Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:23">[02:47:23]</a>.

In 1988, Nike launched the iconic **"Just Do It"** campaign, further cementing its cultural impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:01">[02:48:01]</a>. The 1990s saw Nike's market cap hit $10 billion by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:53">[02:48:53]</a>, but the early 2000s were challenging due to labor controversies and losing athletes like Kobe Bryant to Adidas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. However, Kobe later paid $8 million to leave Adidas and join Nike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>.

## Modern Evolution and Business Strategy

In 2003, Nike acquired Converse for $309 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:49">[02:50:49]</a>, and in 2003, LeBron James signed with Nike directly out of high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:31">[02:51:31]</a>.

A significant shift occurred in 2006 when Tim Cook joined Nike's board, influencing their digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:56">[02:51:56]</a>. This led to the launch of **Nike+iPod**, a clunky but foundational product that helped Nike understand direct engagement with customers through technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:13">[02:52:13]</a>. This evolved into their mobile apps (e.g., Nike Run Club, Training Club, SNKRS), which now boast 500 million quarterly users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:28">[02:54:28]</a>. Nike also shifted its acquisition strategy from brands (like Starter or Cole Haan) to technologies that extend their brand and customer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:47">[02:54:47]</a>.

Around 2013-2014, Nike initiated a major strategic pivot towards **direct-to-consumer (D2C)** sales, reducing reliance on wholesale retailers and operating their own e-commerce and retail stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:05">[02:55:05]</a>. Today, 40% of their $50 billion business is D2C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:27">[02:51:27]</a>. They also embraced personalization through platforms like Nike by You (formerly NikeiD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:32">[02:56:32]</a>.

The rise of sneakerhead culture and the secondary market for limited-edition shoes (valued at billions of dollars) highlights Nike's cultural impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:13">[02:57:13]</a>. Nike intentionally prices these coveted shoes accessibly (e.g., $150-300), even though they instantly resell for thousands, choosing to forego direct profit from the secondary market to maintain brand attainability and ubiquity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:06">[02:59:06]</a>.

In 2018, Nike launched the controversial yet impactful **"Dream Crazy"** campaign with Colin Kaepernick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:01">[03:02:01]</a>. This ad, focused on "standing for something," demonstrated Nike's willingness to take a stance on social issues, even alienating some consumers, to align with a set of values and resonate deeply with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:12">[03:04:12]</a>. This campaign, despite Kaepernick's distance from active sport and Nike's core shoe sales, was a pinnacle of Nike's brand halo strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:01">[03:05:01]</a>.

Following internal leadership issues and controversies in 2019, John Donahoe (formerly CEO of ServiceNow and eBay) was brought in as CEO to reset the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:54">[03:06:54]</a>. Nike also underwent a major reorg, shifting from a sport-focused structure to a men's, women's, and kids' segmentation, reflecting their retail interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:33">[03:51:33]</a>.

## Current State and Outlook

### Financials and Market Presence
Nike's [[Nikes_financials_and_market_presence | financials and market presence]] are immense:
*   **Revenue:** $51 billion, growing 10% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:30">[03:20:30]</a>.
*   **Market Share:** More than twice the size of Adidas, and Adidas is more than three times the size of the next competitor (Skechers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:17">[02:56:17]</a>.
*   **Sales Breakdown:** 60% wholesale, 40% direct-to-consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:35">[03:21:35]</a>.
*   **Gender Split:** Men's sales (51%) are dominant, while women's sales ($8.6 billion, 21%) alone are larger than Lululemon's entire revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:43">[03:20:43]</a>.
*   **Product Categories:** Footwear is almost 3x the apparel business by revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:36">[03:38:36]</a>.
*   **Profitability:** 44% gross margin, 12.5% operating margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:03">[03:22:03]</a>. (Compared to luxury brands like Hermes at 71% gross margin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:30">[03:22:30]</a>.
*   **Cash Position:** $10.7 billion in cash and equivalents, no longer constrained by capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:04">[03:23:04]</a>. They pay increasing dividends and spend $4 billion annually on "demand creation" (marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:55">[03:23:55]</a>.
*   **Basketball Dominance:** Near monopoly in basketball shoes, with 86% share in performance basketball and 96% in lifestyle basketball a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:59">[03:25:59]</a>.

Nike is the official uniform supplier for the MLB, NFL, and NBA, paying hundreds of millions for the swoosh to appear on game-day jerseys, even if they don't directly sell most replica jerseys (which are often made by Fanatics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:03">[03:28:03]</a>.

### Power and Playbook Summary

*   **Scale Economies:** Nike's primary power derives from its massive scale economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:06">[03:08:06]</a>. Its size allows it to dominate athlete sponsorships, make massive marketing investments, and control manufacturing capacity, outcompeting smaller rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:51">[03:09:51]</a>.
*   **Brand:** While not a "luxury" brand in terms of pricing power (Nike shoes are generally comparably priced to competitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:59">[03:13:59]</a>, Nike's brand is incredibly strong, inspiring fierce loyalty and pervasive cultural recognition (e.g., the swoosh is tattooed on more bodies than any other company logo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:32">[03:15:32]</a>.
*   **Strategic Leverage:** Early Nike's [[nikes_business_and_marketing_strategy | business and marketing strategy]] was built on "betting the farm" with debt financing and unconventional deals, maintaining high ownership for Phil Knight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:58">[03:35:58]</a>.
*   **Brand Halo Strategy:** Nike creates "Pinnacle products" for elite athletes, fostering an "athlete's dream" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:24">[03:37:24]</a>. This brand prestige then "seeps out" to the broader public, who buy accessible Nike products to participate in the "dream" and show their alignment with the brand's values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Athletes are effectively Nike's "Netflix shows" and "Billboards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:21">[03:39:21]</a>.
*   **Commodity Differentiation:** While some lower-priced Nike shoes (like the Monarch) could be seen as commodities, the brand's power and association with elite performance differentiate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:55">[03:42:55]</a>. Phil Knight stated, "We're a marketing company, and the product is our most important marketing tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:40">[03:44:40]</a>.
*   **Athlete-Centric Approach:** Nike's decision to focus on athletes (like signing Michael Jordan and maintaining loyalty to Tiger Woods) rather than just celebrities (like parting ways with Kanye West, which led to Adidas's significant losses from the Yeezy brand) has been a key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:37">[03:47:37]</a>.

## Bear and Bull Case

### Bear Case
*   **Leadership Transition:** The CEO John Donahoe, an external hire, leads a period of reorganization, potentially losing the company's historical obsession with individual sports and athlete journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:33">[03:51:33]</a>.
*   **Competition in Niches:** While Nike remains dominant overall, smaller brands like Hoka and On Running are gaining significant market share in specialized areas like running trainers, signaling a potential loss of focus in specific categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:53">[03:52:53]</a>.
*   **D2C Strategy Reversals:** Recent moves to reopen wholesale partnerships (e.g., Macy's, Foot Locker) to clear excess inventory could indicate a backtracking on their D2C strategy, causing concern among investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:12">[03:54:12]</a>.
*   **China Market Slowdown:** The Chinese market, a crucial consumer base, faces a slowdown for major brands and a potential shift towards native Chinese brands, compounded by geopolitical complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:39">[03:54:39]</a>.

### Bull Case
*   **Durable Scale Economies:** Nike's massive scale and financial strength allow it to continue investing heavily in brand building and product development, creating a durable competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Ubiquitous Brand:** The Nike brand holds profound meaning for billions globally, reinforced by its media strategy, local market deployment, and manufacturing at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:35">[03:56:35]</a>.
*   **Basketball Dominance:** Nike Basketball and the sneakerhead culture remain the core driving force and pinnacle of the brand's "Halo" effect, showing no signs of slowing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:02">[03:57:02]</a>.

Nike's journey exemplifies how an unwavering focus on growth, bold marketing, strategic partnerships, and continuous innovation can transform a business from a small-scale distributor into a global cultural phenomenon.

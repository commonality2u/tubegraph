Starbucks' global expansion journey is a testament to its unique business model and deeply ingrained culture, enabling it to succeed where many other food and beverage concepts have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Today, Starbucks operates in over 80 countries with 39,000 stores worldwide, demonstrating a remarkable ability to scale across diverse markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Early International Considerations and Strategic Approach
Initially, Starbucks did not spend any money on traditional marketing, instead building its reputation through word-of-mouth and the iconic presence of its cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. The company strategically leveraged partnerships like becoming the official coffee of United Airlines and selling beans in [[international_expansion_and_future_growth_potential_for_costco | Costco]], which acted as free billboards and surprising touchpoints for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. This approach allowed Starbucks to expand brand awareness and acquire customers without significant marketing expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.

When considering international markets, Starbucks adopted a cautious approach, focusing on one market at a time to ensure success before compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. A key decision from early on was to never franchise in the traditional sense, as it was believed this would dilute the company's unique culture and ability to elevate the customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a>. Instead, Starbucks opted for joint venture (JV) partnerships, especially in non-English speaking countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>.

## Japan: A Pioneering Market
Starbucks quickly wrote off Europe for initial expansion, deeming it too challenging to enter as an American company in an already established coffee culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>. Focus then shifted to Japan, despite initial board resistance and a consultant's report labeling it a "non-starter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. The consultant's concerns included the local culture's aversion to walking with coffee cups, the existing smoke-filled *doour* coffee stores, Starbucks' no-smoking policy, and unfavorable real estate economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>.

However, a handwritten letter from a Japanese restaurateur named Eugis son, who was enamored with Starbucks, led to the formation of a joint venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. Starbucks' first Japan store opened in August (a hot and humid month) in Ginza, Tokyo, with an unexpected line of 200 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:24">[01:32:24]</a>. The immediate success, highlighted by a college student ordering a "double tall latte" in English, demonstrated a unique anticipation and desire for the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>. The iconic Starbucks cup quickly became ubiquitous in Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>.

## China: Overcoming Significant Challenges
Starbucks entered China in 1999, initially with a partner that proved unsuccessful due to misaligned values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>. The company bought out the partner and became company-owned, but struggled for almost a decade, losing money and facing internal pressure to exit the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:48">[01:38:48]</a>. China presented enormous challenges as a tea-drinking culture with no morning coffee business and different eating habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

The turning point came with Belinda Wang, an "extraordinary operator" from Singapore and Hong Kong, who took control of the China business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>. Wang advocated for decentralization, arguing that decisions about breakfast menus or other local adaptations could not be made by those in Seattle unfamiliar with Chinese culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:44">[02:16:44]</a>. This strategic shift, combined with initiatives like providing health insurance for employees' parents and grandparents (which intrigued the Chinese government), was instrumental in building Starbucks' presence in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Today, China accounts for 18% of Starbucks' revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a>, with a new store opening every 15 hours in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>.

## Italy: Full Circle with Respect
Starbucks waited 50 years to enter Italy, the very country that inspired its coffee bar concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:16">[02:31:16]</a>. The company believed it had to "earn the right" to enter, waiting until it could present itself in the best possible way, specifically through its high-end [[Innovation and community at Starbucks | Roastery]] concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:09">[02:32:09]</a>. The first Roastery in Milan was opened in a former post office, a location secured through an unlikely connection with Blackstone, the building's owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:44">[02:34:44]</a>.

Starbucks' success in Italy, where espresso is the number one beverage in its stores, is attributed to respecting Italian coffee culture while offering a superior, modern experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:32">[02:37:32]</a>.

## Challenges of Global Scale
Despite its success, global expansion and ubiquity present ongoing challenges for Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. The company strives to ensure that growth doesn't become "intoxicating" and doesn't lead to losing sight of its "secret": internal culture and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Starbucks maintains that it must keep "getting smaller as we're getting bigger" to preserve intimacy and trust with customers and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. The worst outcome for Starbucks would be to become a "utility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:39">[01:52:39]</a>.

The rise of [[Amazons_strategy_and_challenges | mobile order and pay]] (which accounts for 33% of orders today) has been a double-edged sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:14">[01:58:14]</a>. While creating "unbelievable convenience" and a more efficient business model (e.g., holding $1.8 billion in customer-loaded gift cards), it has also "deteriorated" the "third place" experience and "sense of community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:18">[02:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:47">[02:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:37">[02:03:37]</a>. This technological refinement was not adequately anticipated, leading to crowded stores and customer dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:59">[02:01:59]</a>. Howard Schultz believes this issue continues to be a "major Achilles heel" for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:08">[02:00:08]</a>.

Early in the speaker's career, a significant challenge to profitability was rigidity in investment practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When tasked with managing money in the bond department at Citibank, he was asked to understand and start a fund for [[history_and_development_of_high_yield_or_junk_bonds | high yield bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This area was widely avoided, with most [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies_in_bond_markets | investment organizations]] having rules against purchasing bonds rated below A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The speaker observed that when there are "no other bidders" at an auction, it's generally a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This highlights the importance of open-mindedness and evolving one's thinking in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Historical Perspective and Initial Resistance

Around the time the speaker began investing in [[history_and_development_of_high_yield_or_junk_bonds | high yield bonds]], Michael Milken was also interested in low-rated bonds, having graduated from Wharton the same year the speaker graduated from Chicago (1969) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Milken reportedly found a famous book by Hickman, which discussed bond experiences from 1900 to 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This book indicated that the lower a bond's rating, the higher its actual rate of return, not just its promised yield but its realized total return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Despite defaults and bankruptcies, including those during the Great Depression, the excess yield received was more than sufficient to offset credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This finding was a key "aha moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

At that time, it was virtually impossible to issue a low-rated bond, as they were deemed "non-investment grade" or "speculative grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Big banks and investment banks (which were separate entities then) did not underwrite them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Moody's manual even defined a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This perceived unsuitability for investment existed "regardless of price," a stance the speaker found illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## The Life Insurance Analogy

The speaker experienced an epiphany around 1981-82 during a financial cable show interview when asked how he could invest in bonds knowing some would default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. His spontaneous answer used the analogy of life insurance companies:
> "The most conservative companies in America are the life insurance companies how can they insure people's lives when they know they're all going to die?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>

The answer lies in four points:
*   **Awareness of Risk**: The risk is known and not a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Analyzable Risk**: The risk can be analyzed, for example, by sending a doctor to assess health for a policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Diversifiable Risk**: The risk can be diversified across a broad portfolio, not concentrating on high-risk individuals or groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Well-Paid Risk**: The companies are adequately compensated for the risk they take, pricing policies with a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

The speaker noted that this approach is precisely what was applied to [[history_and_development_of_high_yield_or_junk_bonds | high yield bonds]], allowing them to make money "steadily and safely investing in the worst public companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Contrasting Market Perceptions: High Yield vs. Nifty 50

The speaker's career began in 1969 at Citibank's investment research department, which was known for investing in the [[contrast_between_high_yield_bonds_and_traditional_investments_like_the_nifty_50 | Nifty 50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The [[contrast_between_high_yield_bonds_and_traditional_investments_like_the_nifty_50 | Nifty 50]] were considered the "best and fastest growing companies in America," believed to be so good that nothing bad could happen and "there was no price too high" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

This was the "polar opposite" of the market perception for [[history_and_development_of_high_yield_or_junk_bonds | high yield bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>:
*   **[[contrast_between_high_yield_bonds_and_traditional_investments_like_the_nifty_50 | Nifty 50]]**: "no price too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   **[[history_and_development_of_high_yield_or_junk_bonds | High Yield Bonds]]**: "no price low enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

Both of these extreme stances proved to be incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Investors who bought the [[contrast_between_high_yield_bonds_and_traditional_investments_like_the_nifty_50 | Nifty 50]] in 1969 and held them for five years "lost almost all [their] money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This was primarily because they were priced too high, with many selling at 60-90 times earnings, compared to the normal S&P P/E ratio of 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

While some [[contrast_between_high_yield_bonds_and_traditional_investments_like_the_nifty_50 | Nifty 50]] companies were genuinely strong, many were overvalued, and some perceptions of their invincibility were illusory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Examples include IBM (which faced challenges), Xerox (which lost market share to imports and needed a new business model), and Simplicity Patterns (which became obsolete due to [[changing_consumer_behavior_in_investment_evaluation | changing consumer behavior]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The concept of disruption was often overlooked, and "moats were considered inviolent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This led to significant losses, with many companies in the [[contrast_between_high_yield_bonds_and_traditional_investments_like_the_nifty_50 | Nifty 50]] experiencing declines of over 90% from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

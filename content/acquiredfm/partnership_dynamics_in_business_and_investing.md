## Enduring Partnerships: The Munger-Buffett Model

Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett have maintained a "beautiful partnership" for half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Their enduring relationship is attributed to several factors:
*   **Shared Values** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>: Both Munger and Buffett desired to keep their families safe and perform well for their investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Warren Buffett continues to prioritize the safety of Berkshire's shareholders above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Conservative Approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>: They deliberately chose not to use more leverage, even if it could have tripled their capital, to avoid "screwing up their basic shelter position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Mutual Enjoyment and Complementary Roles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>: It helps if partners like each other and enjoy working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Successful partnerships often thrive when individuals are skilled in different areas, leading to a natural division of labor where "each one likes what he's doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Proximity**: While Munger acknowledges that not living in the same city *may* have helped their partnership endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, he notes that they spent a lot of time together when they were younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   **Early Success**: Munger suggests that early, "low hanging fruit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a> and "wonderful early years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> are crucial for long-term success in investing.

### Challenges and Lessons from Past Ventures
Berkshire Hathaway faced "close misses" and "terrible problems" in its history, such as the situation with Solomon Brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a> and the Buffalo Evening News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. Munger states that they had to deal with "real terrible problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>, highlighting the difficult nature of building a lasting enterprise.

## Investment Firm Dynamics: VC vs. Berkshire

Charlie Munger views [[venture_capital_dynamics_and_firm_structure | venture capital]] as "very poorly done" in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. He believes that many venture capitalists are "not great investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a> and are too focused on fees and selling to the highest bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

### Fees and Alignment
Munger criticizes the high fees (e.g., 2 and 20, or 3 and 30) charged by many private funds, arguing they are "not getting a good return" for endowments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. He advocates for fee structures where the fund managers earn significantly less on additional capital, forcing fees down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

> "The world is full of XG Goldman sax partners that formed the private fund and they manage a billion dollars or something like that and they charge two points off the top plus the and that enables them to make very handsome loadings themselves but the endowments are not getting a good return." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>

### Investor-Manager Relationships
In contrast to venture capital, Berkshire Hathaway's model fosters strong, long-term relationships with the companies it acquires. Berkshire's operating companies know they are "not trying to discard them to the highest bid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This "Buy and Hold" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>, or "Buy and Keep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, creates a reputation for staying with things, which helps in fostering trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

> "The ordinary rule is that people in the business doing the work, they more than not they hate the Venture capis they don't feel they their partner trying to help them to come think they're only taking care of themselves and so on and so on and they don't like them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>
>
> "That's not true in berer you see our people they know we're not trying to discard them to the highest bid see if some investment banker offers us 20 times earnings or some lousy business we don't sell. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>"

## Leadership and Partner Dynamics in Companies

### Costco's Leadership
Costco's success is attributed to its "magic of the business model and culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>, combined with "very reliable, hardworking, determined execution for 40 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

Costco's initial leadership, particularly the relationship between Jeff Brotman (very smart but not a retailer) and Jim Sinegal, involved a "big internal struggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> where Sinegal insisted on being CEO, leading to Brotman moving aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

### BYD's Leadership
Munger highlights the genius of BYD's CEO, describing him as a "fanatic that knows how to actually make things with his hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>, a natural engineer, and a "get done type production executive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. This individual's determination allowed BYD to succeed despite Munger and Buffett advising against entering the car business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a> and the company making "huge mistakes" early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Wisdom in Partnerships

Munger emphasizes the difficulty of investing, stating it is "very hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a> and "not a bit easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>, contrary to what some investment advisors might suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. Building great things requires intense effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>.

*   **Patience and Conviction**: When a truly exceptional investment opportunity arises, which might only happen "maybe five, six times in a lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>, one must "bet heavily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Developing this conviction requires "a lot of reading and thinking and visiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This principle is a cornerstone of [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | traditional investing principles]].
*   **The Value of Luck**: Munger believes that "unusually good results" in business typically combine intelligence, hard work, and significant luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. The way to increase chances of good luck is to "start early and keep trying a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. This perspective aligns with principles of [[complexity_investing_principles]].
*   **Aging and Perspective**: Munger states that at 99, he believes investing is "just so hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>, a sentiment he knew at 70 but has since intensified. He also cites Peter Kaufman's saying: "a young man knows the rules and an old man knows the exceptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>.

> [On the hot dog price at Costco] "Anybody else would have raised the price of hot dogs a long time ago. They just don't do it. They just know that it's like half famous and people bring their kids in... they know they've got something going there that's worth extra money to and they just don't destroy it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>

*   **Family Advice**: For building families, Munger advises getting along with everyone, helping through tough times, and having trust, particularly concerning the education of children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. He echoes the idea that "the best way to have a great spouse is to deserve one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. This can be viewed as an extension of [[equality_and_partnership_in_venture_capital | equality and partnership in venture capital]] to personal life.

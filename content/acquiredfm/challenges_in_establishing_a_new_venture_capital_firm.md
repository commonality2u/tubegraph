Establishing a new [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital firm]], particularly one built on a revolutionary model, presented significant challenges in the mid-1990s. The story of Benchmark Capital's founding members illustrates the deeply ingrained resistance to change within the traditional [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | venture capital industry]] and the audacious vision required to overcome it.

## The Push for Equal Partnership

The impetus for a new firm stemmed from a profound dissatisfaction with the existing [[venture_capital_partnership_models | venture capital partnership models]] prevalent in Silicon Valley. A 1995 *New York Times* article, though oddly focused on the "politics of Silicon Valley venture farms," quoted an anonymous source regarding Merrill Pickard's split: "if Meryl Pickard had divided the rewards more equitably they wouldn't have split up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This sentiment was echoed by Robert Cagle, then a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI), who observed, "today the power is much more distributed since the young Robert Kegel nobody can claim that they are making all the money for the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. He noted a "resentment in the air among the younger partners of venerated Silicon Valley Adventure farms at this time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, implying that while power was *said* to be distributed, the reality at firms like TVI and Merrill Pickard was otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Bob Cagle, who grew up in Flint, Michigan, from a blue-collar background and was the first in his family to attend college (General Motors University, then Stanford Business School) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, had a strong conviction about fairness. After a successful 10-year tenure at TVI, where he spearheaded investments in companies like Synopsys, Avant, and Viosoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, he felt that senior partners still controlled "all the economics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. He developed "an almost religious fervor that anything other than an equal partnership was just like morally wrong for a [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital firm]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, driven by a sense of fairness and the desire for "proper rewards for proper work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. He believed this so deeply that he was willing to leave TVI if it couldn't convert to an equal partnership model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Ultimately, internal discussions at TVI failed to reach a resolution, leading the senior partners to "declare victory" and effectively dissolve the firm, managing out existing funds and board seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Dave Marquardt, a key figure at TVI known for his role in the Microsoft investment, went on to found August Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Recruiting Challenges and Resistance

In early 1994, with TVI dissolving, Bob Cagle approached Bruce Dunleavy, a former intern of his at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and a rising "Young Turk" at Merrill Pickard who had invested in Palm Pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Bob proposed starting a new firm together based on the equal partnership principle, anticipating the rise of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Bruce, while honored, initially declined, citing a lack of the "Microsoft money" safety net that Bob had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

However, a few months later, the "bug of equal partnership" also infected discussions at Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Bruce and fellow young partner Andy Ratcliffe pushed for equal economics within their firm, but those conversations likely met the same resistance as at TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

With their backs against the wall and having "burned the boats" from their previous firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, Bob, Bruce, and Andy began to recruit additional partners. This proved to be a significant hurdle:
*   **Industry Inertia**: When they approached other young General Partners (GPs) across Silicon Valley, the prevailing reaction was, "you guys are freaking nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Many established GPs saw no reason to leave their successful firms for such a radical idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   **Capacity and Diversification Concerns**: Bruce was particularly pragmatic, noting that "just the two of us... We're not gonna have enough capacity to be able to create like an actual portfolio that makes sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. They needed enough investment capacity for diversification, especially given their desired [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | venture capital strategies]] of eight to ten board seats per person and no investments without board seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Credibility with Limited Partners (LPs)**: A small team of two or three would also face credibility issues when talking to LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Bruce admitted that during this period, he too "started thinking maybe we were a little nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## Building the Team

Despite the initial skepticism, they successfully recruited Andy Ratcliffe from Merrill Pickard, bringing their core team to three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Realizing the difficulty in attracting established venture GPs, Bruce suggested looking outside the traditional venture mold to bring in "entrepreneurial DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This led them to Kevin Harvey, an entrepreneur who had started two companies, one acquired by Apple and another, Approach Software (where Bruce had been on the board), sold to Lotus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Harvey was eager to join, finding it "way easier than starting another company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

With Bob, Bruce, Andy, and Kevin, they had four partners, but aimed for at least five for a viable firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. They found their fifth co-founder in Val Vaden, another Stanford Business School alumnus who had experience in software company buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. By the end of 1994, this group of five—Bob, Bruce, Andy, Kevin, and Val—was ready to raise their first fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

The audacious name they chose for their firm, "Benchmark Capital," was a direct reflection of their aspirations to set "a new Benchmark for performance in this industry and how [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]] is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, stemming from their challenges and deeply held beliefs.

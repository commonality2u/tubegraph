## Introduction

At 99 years old, Charlie Munger, who would turn 100 on January 1st, shared his perspective on the last 99 years of human history. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> The conversation covered various topics, including Costco, his history investing in retailers, building great partnerships, issues in global securities markets, the concept of investing versus gambling, and current [[investment_strategy_and_personality_alignment | investment opportunities]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>

## On Investing

### Investing vs. Gambling

Munger is critical of modern financial practices that blur the line between investing and gambling:
*   **Sports Betting**: He views the proliferation of sports betting as detrimental, comparing it to dog tracks, racetracks, and casinos, stating they are "of course not" good for America. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>
*   **Retail Stock Trading**: Munger believes that for many Americans, retail stock trading is akin to gambling because they "don't really know anything about the companies" and "just gamble on going up and down price." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   **Taxation**: If he were in charge, Munger would implement a tax on short-term gains with no offset for losses, aiming to "drive this whole crowd of people all of business." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>
*   **Algorithms**: He described Renaissance's early algorithm as recognizing human trend-following behavior, programming computers to automatically buy on "up up" days and sell before the end of the second day, generating consistent daily checks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> Modern algorithms, he states, exploit the knowledge of what index funds have to buy, achieving returns through "huge leverage," which he would not personally undertake if already wealthy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>

### The Costco Case Study

Costco is a company Munger deeply admires and has publicly championed.
*   **Discovery**: Munger was introduced to Price Club by Rod Hills, who knew Sol Price. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> Munger was impressed by Sol Price, describing him as a "very intelligent man" who started the Government Employees Discount Company at age 39. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>
*   **Investment**: Munger invested in Price Club by buying stock in the market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> He joined Costco's board at Warren Buffett's suggestion, as Buffett preferred "shorter plane rides to director's meetings." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>
*   **Warren's View on Retail**: Munger tried to convince Warren Buffett to buy out Carrefour's stake in Costco, but Buffett declined because he "doesn't like retailing" due to its difficulty and the high rate of failure for formerly mighty retail businesses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> Despite this, their prior retail investment in Diversified was profitable, largely due to repurchasing their own undervalued stock during a "valuation vacation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>
*   **"Know You're Right" Opportunities**: Munger refers to Costco as one of the few times in a lifetime "when you know you're right and you know you have one that's really going to work wonderfully." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a> These opportunities are rare, maybe "five six times in a lifetime," and people often "go broke" by thinking it's easy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>
*   **Costco's Winning Formula**:
    *   **Lower Prices**: "They really did sell cheaper than anybody else in America." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>
    *   **Efficient Stores**: Big, efficient stores with large, 10-foot-wide parking spaces. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>
    *   **Customer Focus**: Kept out low-volume customers and offered special benefits like reward points for executive memberships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
    *   **Capital-Light Model**: They had "no investment in them" as suppliers waited for payment, and payments were scheduled after sales. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> This effectively meant no inventory sitting on their books. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a> This creates "automatic leverage" without debt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>
    *   **Low SKU Count**: This virtue was also utilized by other businesses like Home Depot and Floor & Decor, which copied the Costco model. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a> Munger believes the "miscellaneous stuff" added by imitators will "eventually kill you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>
    *   **Strategic Locations**: Costco specialized in "good locations where the rich people live," an approach Walmart neglected due to being "too wedded by the ideas they already had." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>
    *   **Hot Dog Price**: The famous $1.50 hot dog price is an "exception" that Costco maintains because it's "like half famous" and people bring their kids for it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a> It exemplifies the central norm of "don't raise the market, get it low and keep it there forever." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>
    *   **Growth Rate**: Costco's 10% annual growth is limited by the difficulty of opening new stores, managing new managers, and integrating new politics, rather than capital constraints. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>
    *   **Audience**: Sol Price knew early on that he "always wanted the rich man trying to save money." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>

### Brand Power and Pricing

Munger emphasizes the enduring value of strong brands:
*   **See's Candies**: Berkshire Hathaway's acquisition of See's Candies for $20 million was pivotal. They quickly discovered they could raise prices by 10% annually without losing volume, leading to decades of profit without requiring new capital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a> The opportunity arose because the family needed liquidity for death taxes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>
*   **Heinz Ketchup vs. Kraft Cheese**: Munger highlights the difference in pricing power: people are willing to pay more for Heinz ketchup because of its unique flavor on a fried potato, but not for Kraft cheese. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a> This is due to "trade secrets" in unique sauce flavors, which can lead to near-monopolies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>
*   **Luxury Brands**: Companies like Hermes and LVMH have built their brands over centuries, creating a level of trust that makes them enduring. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>
*   **Scarcity**: He advises against looking for opportunities to buy such rare brands because the chances are "so low." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>

### The Modern Investment Landscape

Munger believes finding great investment opportunities is increasingly difficult.
*   **Harder Than Ever**: "It's very difficult to invest money well" and "impossible to do time after time after time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a> He believes it was "plenty hard" at 70, but now knows "how hard it is." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>
*   **Too Much Capital**: There's "so much capital and so much competition," a stark contrast to the "cigar butt era." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>
*   **"Low-Hanging Fruit" is Gone**: The easy money is "almost non-existent" or "very small." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>
*   **Concentration in Big Tech**: The concentration of capital in a few big tech companies like Apple is a "natural outcome" of "human nature and competition." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>
*   **Self-Insure**: Munger advises that once wealthy enough, one should self-insure "practically everything" to avoid paying for the "stupidity" of others and the insurance company's overhead. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a> He carries no fire insurance and only auto insurance because it's legally required. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>

### International Opportunities

*   **Japanese Trading Houses**: Munger considers Berkshire's investment in Japanese trading houses a "no-brainer," an idea that comes "maybe two, three times a century." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a> They offered "5% dividends" while interest rates in Japan were "half a percent per year for 10 years," creating a "huge flow of cash with no investment, no thought, no anything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a> Berkshire's unique credit allowed them to borrow at these rates, enabling what felt like "God just opening a chest and just pouring money into it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>
*   **China**: Munger is willing to have "some China risk" in his portfolio because he believes the Chinese economy has "better future prospects" over the next 20 years than almost any other big economy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a> Additionally, "the leading companies of China are stronger and better than practically any other leading companies anywhere" and are "available at a cheaper price." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>
*   **BYD**: Munger is a big fan of BYD, the Chinese electric vehicle and battery maker, despite the company's aggressive growth making him "nervous." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a> He describes BYD's founder as a "genius" with a PhD in engineering who can figure out how to make any part. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a> Munger and Buffett tried to dissuade BYD from entering the car business, calling it a "graveyard," but the founder ignored them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a> Munger differentiates BYD's founder from Elon Musk, stating the BYD founder is "closer to ground zero" and better at "actually making things with his hands." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a> The investment in BYD, which started at $270 million and grew to $8 billion, is a "venture capital type investment" that happened to be a thinly traded public company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>

### Investment Philosophy

*   **Bet Heavily**: "When you know you have an edge you should bet heavily." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a> This is counter to what is taught in business school. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>
*   **Conviction**: Developing conviction comes from "a lot of reading and thinking and visiting." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>
*   **Intelligence, Hard Work, Luck**: Unusually good results in investing require all three: "very intelligent, they worked very hard, they were very lucky." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a> Luck can be cultivated by "start[ing] early and keep[ing] trying a long time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>
*   **Buy and Hold**: Berkshire's reputation for never selling a "halfway decent business" helps them, contrasting with others who might sell to the highest bidder. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>
*   **Avoid Fund Structures**: Munger dislikes the "two and twenty" or "three and thirty" fee structures of private funds, stating that many "don't want to make money by screwing your investors." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a> He notes that endowments are starting to push back on these fees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>
*   **"Cigar Butt" vs. Great Companies**: He studies two kinds of companies: "crap companies" that are "really cheap" (Ben Graham style) and "brand companies" that are "good" if acquired at the right price during "few rare occasions" when they're cheap. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>
*   **EBITDA Criticism**: Munger considers EBITDA a "criminal" metric, arguing that taking depreciation out of earnings for a capital-intensive business like a truck company is "lying about the earnings." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a> He expresses strong dislike for John Malone's "extreme manipulations" related to tax avoidance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>

## On Partnerships

### The Buffett Partnership

Munger's 50-year partnership with Warren Buffett is a cornerstone of his career.
*   **Similarities**: They shared similar goals: keeping their families safe and doing a good job for their investors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a> Warren "still cares more about the safety of his shareholders than he cares about anything else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>
*   **Leverage**: Munger believes that Berkshire could have used "a little bit more leverage" to achieve three times greater returns without significantly more risk, but their priority was "never to give them at least chance of screwing up our basic shelter position." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>
*   **Geographic Separation**: Not living in the same city "may have helped" their partnership endure, as time spent together became "special rather than being common." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>
*   **"Close Misses"**: They fondly remember "the close misses where we were dealing with real terrible problems," such as the Solomon Brothers scandal or the "holy war" with the Buffalo Evening News, where they took risks that could have led to big losses or bad publicity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>

### General Advice for Partnerships

*   **Mutual Affection and Enjoyment**: "It helps if you like one another and enjoy work together." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>
*   **Complementary Skills**: Many successful partnerships work because "one's good at one thing and one's good at another," leading to a natural division of labor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>
*   **Culture and Execution**: The success of a business like Costco is a "culture plus model" that requires "very reliable, hardworking, determined execution for 40 years." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>

## On [[the_culture_and_dynamics_of_venture_capital_partnerships | Venture Capital]]

Munger is highly critical of the modern venture capital industry:
*   **Gambling**: He states that VC deals often get "so hot" and require quick decisions, leading to "all just sort of gambling." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>
*   **Poorly Done**: He believes the role of venture capital in society is "very poorly done." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>
*   **Founders' Disdain**: A common outcome is that "people in the business doing the work...hate the venture capitalists" because they feel VCs are only "taking care of themselves" rather than truly partnering to help. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>
*   **Attracting the "Wrong People"**: The industry attracts "wrong people" who are "a lot like investment bankers deciding which hot new area they're going to get in." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>
*   **Contrast with Berkshire**: Berkshire Hathaway's permanent holding company model ensures that their operating companies "know we're not trying to discard them to the highest bid." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a> This "buy and hold not only mentality but demonstration is the key thing that aligns investors with managers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>

## Looking Back and Forward

*   **Difficulty of Investing**: Munger reiterates that "it's very difficult to invest money well," and it's "not a bit easy" to get consistently good results. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>
*   **Not Easy Now**: While it was "a lot easier" in the past, it's "harder now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>
*   **Market Conditions**: The world is "damn near" out of good opportunities, and "everything in the whole world is overpriced." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>
*   **Unpleasant Outcome**: If the current trends continue, the "natural end" is "an unpleasant blow up of some kind." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>
*   **Predictability**: Most businesses today face "a lot of change and threat in their future," unlike specialized industrial companies or monopolies in the past (like newspapers). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>

## Personal Reflections

*   **Life Choice**: Munger states that he would likely go into the investment business again because "it suits my nature," but he would prefer to operate with his own money rather than managing a fund for others due to the freedom it provides. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>
*   **Marriage and Family**: His advice on building families is to "get along with everybody," "help them through their tough times," and foster trust. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a> The best way to have a great spouse is to "deserve one." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>
*   **Learning**: He cites an old saying from Peter Kaufman: "a young man knows the rules and an old man knows the exceptions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>
*   **Enjoyment**: Munger states he and Warren have had "about the same amount of fun all the way through" their partnership. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a> Even at 99, he finds "practically everything is fun, even politics." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>
*   **One Success is Enough**: "You only have to get rich once you do not have to clap this mountain four times you just have to do it once." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>

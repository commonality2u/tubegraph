[[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]] has faced numerous challenges and legal disputes throughout its history, ranging from intense industry battles to complex antitrust lawsuits and internal corporate struggles.

## Early Business Hurdles
In its early days, before focusing primarily on cellular technology, [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]] and its predecessor, Linkabit, faced significant business hurdles. Linkabit's first commercial project involved building a satellite communication system for Walmart, which helped them transition from consulting to a product/contract-focused company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

When [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]] was founded in 1985, they knew their ambitious goal of bringing digital cellular networks to the masses was a "massive opportunity," but also that they couldn't do it immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>. They started by bootstrapping with consulting work, much like Linkabit did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

A major financial challenge emerged with the development of OmniTrax, their mobile satellite network for commercial trucks. To fund this, [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]] merged with its customer, Omnet, in 1988, raising $3.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>. This merger significantly diluted the equity of the original founders and employees, with many feeling "pretty bitter" about giving up half the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.

## The "Holy Wars of Wireless"
In the late 1980s, [[Qualcomms role in the development of wireless technology standards | Qualcomm]] entered what became known as the "Holy Wars of Wireless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>. The US cellular industry was looking to upgrade from analog 1G to digital 2G networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Europe was already adopting TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) as its standard through Ericsson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>.

However, [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]]'s founders, having developed and patented CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>, believed TDMA would not meet the capacity requirements for the growing popularity of cell phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. They went on a roadshow to pitch CDMA to individual carriers, facing skepticism because their technology was considered "crazy" and required sophisticated processing power that seemed unfeasible for mobile devices at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>.

A crucial factor in their favor was the US government's non-mandatory approach to industry standards, unlike Europe's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>. This allowed [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]] to convince carriers based on the economic advantage of CDMA â€“ 3 to 5 times more efficient, leading to lower costs and higher subscriber capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>.

## Financial and Business Model Pressures
Despite the eventual success of CDMA, [[Qualcomms business model and patent strategy | Qualcomm]]'s stock was "basically flat" and Wall Street "kind of hates it" up until 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:19">[01:34:19]</a>. This was because its capital-intensive manufacturing operations, through joint ventures with Nortel and Sony, were tying up all the company's profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:24">[01:34:24]</a>.

To address this, [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]] made a strategic decision to divest its manufacturing businesses in 1999. They sold their infrastructure business (base stations) to Ericsson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>. This sale was part of a settlement deal following lawsuits that had "popped up between the two companies along the way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:12">[01:35:12]</a>. Employees transferred to Ericsson were "so freaking pissed" they lost their [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] stock options that they filed a class-action lawsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>. In December 1999, [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]] sold its mobile phone business to Kyocera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:14">[01:36:14]</a>. This established their future business model: selling high-margin semiconductor designs (QTC) and licensing their vast patent portfolio (QTL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>.

## The Paul Jacobs Era and Diversification Challenges
Under Paul Jacobs's leadership (2005-2013), [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]]'s strategic initiatives included a major push into IoT (Internet of Things) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>. However, this period is "viewed at a very light" as IoT "didn't really become a thing" at that time, making it a "lost era for [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:07">[01:43:07]</a>. A notable failure was their $2 billion investment in Mirasol, a reflective display technology, which yielded "zero customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:57">[01:45:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:07">[01:46:07]</a>. [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]] has historically "failed at everything that was not a phone" when straying too far from its core competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>.

## Major Antitrust and Patent Disputes
Starting around 2009, [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] began to be widely seen by customers and media as "value capture pioneers," leading to increased litigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>.

Key legal disputes include:
*   **Broadcom Lawsuit (2009):** [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] lost a lawsuit to Broadcom and was forced to pay $900 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:42">[01:45:42]</a>.
*   **Chinese Licensing Dispute (2015):** [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] faced a major licensing dispute with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:35">[01:50:35]</a>.
*   **Activist Investor (2015):** Jana Partners, an activist investor, tried to split [[Qualcomms business model and patent strategy | Qualcomm]]'s licensing and chip businesses, arguing the former was just "printing cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:57">[01:50:57]</a>. [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] resisted this split, keeping the businesses together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:57">[01:50:57]</a>.
*   **Broadcom Hostile Takeover Attempt (2018):** Broadcom attempted a hostile takeover of [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]] at a valuation of $103 billion, financed by $106 billion in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:58">[01:50:58]</a>. The Trump Administration intervened, blocking the deal due to national security concerns related to Broadcom's ties with Huawei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>. This was seen by some as [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] "calling in a favor" due to its strong government relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>.
*   **FTC and Apple Lawsuits (2017):** Both the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Apple sued [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:38">[01:50:38]</a>. They alleged that [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] was abusing its market position as the dominant smartphone modem supplier to "force manufacturers into paying excessive fees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>. Apple claimed [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] was charging "exorbitant fees" for patent licenses, estimated at $17 per phone *plus* the cost of the baseband chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:20">[01:53:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>. [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]]'s patent licensing model, requiring payment of "fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory" (FRAND) terms for industry-standard patents, was at the core of these disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:21">[01:55:21]</a>. Apple also revealed that [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] had stipulated that if Apple ever used a competing supplier, they would owe [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:29">[01:54:29]</a>. The lawsuit settled in 2019, with Apple agreeing to continue using [[Qualcomms role in the development of mobile system on a chip | Qualcomm]]'s radios and paying $4.5 billion for a six-year patent license deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:54">[01:59:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:10">[02:00:10]</a>.

[[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]] has also faced numerous lawsuits from other countries and companies, including China, South Korea, the EU, and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:28">[02:14:28]</a>. Critics argue that [[Qualcomms litigation and regulatory challenges | Qualcomm]]'s aggressive patent monetization strategy, enabled by the US patent system, has created a de facto monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>.

## Modern Challenges and Future Outlook
Despite these challenges, [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]] continues to thrive, with revenue growth of 32% and earnings growth of 47% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:57">[02:09:57]</a>. However, it faces new challenges:
*   **Low-End Competition:** Companies like MediaTek have surpassed [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]] in unit shipments for low- and mid-end Android phones by offering cheaper baseband modem chips and systems on a chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:34">[02:13:34]</a>.
*   **Customer Backlash:** [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]]'s aggressive licensing practices have "poked the bearer" enough to motivate major customers like Apple and Samsung to develop their own in-house radio and system-on-a-chip solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:57">[02:14:57]</a>. While Apple still uses [[Qualcomms role in the development of mobile system on a chip | Qualcomm]]'s chips for the 2023 iPhone, the company anticipates "almost zero dollar" from Apple in its chips business after that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:52">[02:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:25">[02:01:25]</a>.
*   **Diversification Risk:** While [[Qualcomms transformation and business model evolution | Qualcomm]]'s CEO is now pitching a broader growth story in IoT, automotive, and RF front ends (collectively the "intelligent connected Edge") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:12">[02:04:12]</a>, these are areas where [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]] has historically struggled outside of phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>. The success of this strategy is crucial for [[Qualcomms history and founding story | Qualcomm]]'s next decade of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:54">[02:23:54]</a>.

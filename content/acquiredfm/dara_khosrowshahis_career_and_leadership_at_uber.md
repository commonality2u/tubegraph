## Introduction
Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Uber, has had a remarkable career trajectory, marked by significant leadership roles and transformative decisions. His journey from leading Expedia to steering the helm of Uber has not only showcased his ability to drive complex operations but also his capacity to guide a company through substantial strategic transitions.

## Early Career and Expedia Leadership
Before joining Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi held the position of CEO at Expedia from 2004 to 2017, a tenure spanning 13 years. During his time at Expedia, he was instrumental in expanding the company's footprint in the online travel space, navigating it through challenging times, including the 9/11 aftermath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Expedia's acquisition by IAC, led by Barry Diller, was a critical event in his career. It unfolded during a tumultuous time marked by [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_global_market | global uncertainty and shifting market dynamics]]. The deal was agreed upon before September 11, 2001, and faced potential collapse due to the subsequent economic distress following the attacks. However, under Diller's and Khosrowshahi's leadership, the acquisition went ahead, reflecting their belief in the enduring value of travel, despite short-term crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Transition to Uber
In 2017, Dara Khosrowshahi made the high-profile move from Expedia to Uber, amid a period of intense scrutiny and internal turmoil for the ride-sharing giant. His decision to take on the role was influenced in part by conversations with leaders like Daniel Ek, who emphasized the potential impact and importance of leading Uber at that juncture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

Upon assuming the CEO position, Khosrowshahi's initial focus was on stabilizing Uber and steering it towards profitability. His background as a "mature operator" was critical in addressing Uber's substantial operational challenges, especially given the [[challenges_and_dynamics_within_venture_capital_firms | high-profile controversies]] and financial losses the company was experiencing prior to his leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

Moreover, Khosrowshahi has been involved in high-stakes negotiations and restructuring.

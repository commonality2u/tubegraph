The choice of [[investment_strategy_and_personal_suitability | investment strategy]] can significantly benefit from aligning with an individual's personal skill set and temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:08">[04:08:08]</a>. Rather than forcing a "square peg in a round hole," successful investors often gravitate towards approaches that naturally suit their capabilities and personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:49">[04:10:49]</a>.

## Public vs. Private Markets and Personal Suitability

In public markets, a vast amount of information is readily available, making it challenging to gain a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Private markets, being less liquid, can offer more opportunities for advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### The Shift to Early Stage Private Investing (Venture Capital)

One investor notes that while venture capital is not necessarily "super inefficient" and competition for promising companies is fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, the transition to early-stage private market investing (venture capital) was driven by a specific alignment of skills and interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
*   **Suitability for long-term qualitative judgments:** Venture investing involves making qualitative judgments about the future, visualizing what a business could become in 10 years if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This contrasts with the analysis typical of public markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Probabilistic Endeavor:** Venture is a probabilistic endeavor where the average outcome is often a loss of capital, but a portfolio of such bets can yield great returns by finding "extremely high expected value investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Engagement with Founders:** A love for "hunting for Founders" and working with them is also a significant motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Tolerance for Permanent Capital Loss:** Unlike traditional value investing principles that emphasize avoiding permanent capital loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, venture capital is inherently characterized by it, as many investments will fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The investor acknowledges they would not be adept at managing a portfolio where all companies perform uniformly well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Optimism and Future-Orientation:** This approach is suited for an optimist who enjoys thinking about what a company "could be if it works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:15">[06:17:15]</a>.

### Applying Traditional Lenses to Venture Capital
Applying traditional investing principles, such as those from [[value_investing_vs_growth_investing | Buffett investing lenses]], to venture capital involves envisioning a company's potential future value if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:44">[04:21:44]</a>. This includes:
*   Visualizing what the business could look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:48">[04:40:48]</a>.
*   Forecasting potential financials, even when a company is in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:24">[04:51:24]</a>.
*   Assessing future competitive "moats" and capital requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a>.
*   Considering the likelihood of competition and future [[evolution_of_markets_and_investment_strategies | evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:54">[05:00:54]</a>.

This [[insights_on_tech_investment_strategies_and_decisions | qualitative judgment about the future]] provides a [[the_role_of_skill_and_luck_in_investing_and_decision_making | knowledge advantage]] where readily available current data does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:03">[05:18:03]</a>.

## Other Examples of Skill Set Alignment

### Quantitative Skills and Conservative Personality
One investor's career shift from equities to bonds in 1978 was driven by a desire to avoid repeatedly choosing between similar public companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This move played to his quantitative skills and conservative personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. He notes that starting a venture capital fund would have been a "disaster" for him, as he is neither an optimist nor a futurist, and is "financially something of a chicken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:35">[03:50:35]</a>.

### Distressed Debt Investing
Another example is investing in distressed debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This strategy involves buying the debt of bankrupt companies, with the understanding that while the debt may not be repaid in full, partial repayment or creditors acquiring the company can still yield value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. This strategy suited the partners involved but "wasn't the right thing for Andrew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:07">[07:19:07]</a>.

### Diverse Investment Styles
Different investment styles can be incredibly valuable:
*   **Optimism for Growth:** As seen in venture, being an optimist and focusing on potential future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:15">[06:17:15]</a>.
*   **Pessimism for Value:** Another valid approach is finding companies that are "clearly sucks but it doesn't suck as much as everyone thinks" or are dying slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. This requires a different, equally valuable skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:46">[06:35:46]</a>.

The overarching lesson is to find the [[investment_strategy_and_personal_suitability | type of thing that suits you]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:48">[06:14:48]</a>.

NZS Capital, a hedge fund founded by Brenton Johns and John Bathgate, bases its public equities [[Investment Strategy and Decision Making | investment strategy]] on complexity theory, a concept that originates from the Santa Fe Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. This approach stems from the recognition that traditional economic models, often based on normal or Gaussian distributions, fail to accurately describe the real world, particularly financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

## Understanding Complexity Theory

Complexity theory posits that the world operates as a complex adaptive system, leading to emergent behavior where predicting the future is often useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. Instead of focusing on exact outcomes, the theory emphasizes adaptability and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

This perspective was heavily influenced by Eric Beinhacker's "The Origin of Wealth" and Mitch Waldrop's "Complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. At the Santa Fe Institute, physicists observed that economic theories, unlike hard sciences, often failed to work in practice, prompting a deeper look into how complex systems govern reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. NZS Capital found the biological systems vein of complexity theory more applicable to [[Investing strategies and approaches | investing]] than traditional economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

## NZS Capital's Investment Philosophy

NZS Capital's [[investment_strategy_and_decision_making | investment philosophy]] is derived from the pain of frequently being wrong as investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Their approach prioritizes adaptability and resilience, recognizing that complex adaptive systems are governed by power laws, not normal distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>.

### Resilience

Resilience in investing, for NZS Capital, means focusing on durable, long-term, slow-compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

*   **Ant Colony Analogy**: Companies, like ants, should optimize for longevity and resilience rather than just short-term productivity. Half the ants in a colony studied by Deborah Gordon at the Santa Fe Institute were idle, not focused on productivity, but on the colony's long-term survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. This contrasts with Wall Street's obsession over quarterly earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Compounding**: Even a 15% growth rate, if maintained for 15 years, can nearly double the return compared to 10 years, highlighting that significant value is created in the "out years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Allocation**: Resilient positions typically make up over half the portfolio (around 15 names) and have a low turnover of about 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.
*   **Company Characteristics**: Companies in this category often exhibit mission criticality, high switching costs, significant scale (benefitting from power laws), and strong network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond Moats**: NZS Capital avoids companies that extract maximum economics through "moats" and customer lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. Instead, they seek "non-zero sum" outcomes (NZS Capital's namesake) where the company creates more value than it takes for all stakeholders (employees, customers, society, environment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. This concept aligns with Michael Porter's revised thinking on "shared value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Example: Apple vs. TSMC**: While Apple has strong moats, its aggressive value capture from partners (e.g., App Store fees) makes it less resilient in NZS Capital's view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>. In contrast, TSMC, despite its monopoly in advanced chip manufacturing, maintains lower margins than many customers, fostering a long-term, trust-based platform for massive value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>. This "leaving money on the table" for customers buys the company "duration" of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:18:00">[50:18:00]</a>.

### Optionality

Optionality focuses on investments with asymmetric upside, even if the predictions are less certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>. This is akin to venture capital investing, where a few big wins drive overall returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>.

*   **Portfolio Allocation**: Optionality accounts for just under half the portfolio (around 40 names), with a maximum position size of 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>. This part of the portfolio turns over more quickly as investors accept being wrong often and move on quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:53:00">[45:53:00]</a>.
*   **Managing Uncertainty**: The goal is to maximize the probability of getting lucky, rather than relying on high batting averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:00">[42:23:00]</a>. NZS Capital's internal culture promotes calling out bias and avoiding "conviction," which they view as overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:54:00">[41:54:00]</a>.
*   **Examples**: A company like Peloton before the pandemic was considered optionality; as its business matured and became more "durable," it could be trimmed or considered for the resilient bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:17:00">[48:17:00]</a>.

### Root Moats

"Root Moats" (Resilience with Out-of-the-Money Optionality) combine both principles. These are companies with a strong, resilient core business that also have significant optionality layered on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>.

*   **Examples**: Amazon (for AWS optionality on top of its retail resilience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a> and eBay (for PayPal optionality on top of its marketplace resilience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>. These positions can be bumped up to 7-8% of the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a>.

## Power Law Distributions in Investing

NZS Capital strongly emphasizes that markets are governed by power law distributions, not normal distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>.

*   **Critique of Traditional Risk Models**: Most financial risk models assume normal distributions, which implies that extreme events (like "three standard deviation events") are exceedingly rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>. However, in reality, such events occur much more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:52:00">[36:52:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Ergodic Systems**: This discrepancy is explained by the concept of non-ergodic systems, where the "time average" (an individual's experience over time) does not equal the "ensemble average" (the average experience across many participants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:29:00">[35:29:00]</a>.
*   **Coin Flip Example**: In a coin-flipping contest where winning is +$50 and losing is -$40 (a positive expected return), on average, a group of players would see a positive return. However, most individual players would go bankrupt, while a few would become massive winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. This illustrates why the focus should be on preparing for outliers, not average outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>.
*   **Implications**: Since a few outliers drive most of the value creation, [[judgment_and_decisionmaking_in_investments | investing]] strategies must be optimized around these extreme events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a>. This explains the need for diversified optionality bets, as seen in venture capital where only a few companies provide the bulk of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>.

## Semiconductors through a Complexity Lens

NZS Capital dedicates about a third of its portfolio to semiconductors, viewing them as the "new oxygen" of the information age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:58:00">[56:58:00]</a>. They categorize semiconductor investments into resilient and optionality buckets:

*   **Resilient Semiconductor Companies**:
    *   **Catalog/Analog Microcontrollers**: Companies like Texas Instruments (TI) and Microchip. These businesses have broad product catalogs (e.g., TI with 100,000 parts), long part lifespans (30-40 years), high margins, and are difficult to replicate due to their breadth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>. They serve diverse markets from water meters to coffee makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:40:00">[56:40:00]</a>. TI's operating margins, for instance, are higher than Microsoft's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:33:37">[1:33:37]</a>.
    *   **Semiconductor Capital Equipment**: Companies like ASML, Lam Research, Applied Materials, and Tokyo Electron are considered resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:18:00">[57:18:00]</a>. They are crucial components of the semiconductor ecosystem, necessary for manufacturing chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:21">[1:22:21]</a>.
    *   **EDA Software**: Cadence Design Systems (a long-held position) and Synopsys form a high-quality duopoly in chip design software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:33">[1:03:33]</a>.

*   **Optionality Semiconductor Companies**:
    *   **Digital Companies**: NVIDIA, due to valuation and market context, is held in the optionality tail, despite being a major digital company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:08:00">[57:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Emerging Technologies**: Cree, an early leader in silicon carbide (an alternative to silicon used in electric vehicles and renewable energy), is an optionality play. Its success depends on whether silicon carbide becomes a massive platform, moving from a $1 billion to a $30 billion market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:42:00">[57:42:00]</a>.

### Key Dynamics in the Semiconductor Industry

*   **TSMC vs. Samsung**: While both are leading foundries, TSMC's pure-play foundry model (not competing with its customers) makes it a more trusted and resilient partner for chip designers like Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:40">[1:17:40]</a>. Samsung, being vertically integrated and producing its own consumer electronics, can face conflicts of interest with its foundry customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:01">[1:18:01]</a>.
*   **Moore's Law**: The "spirit of Moore's Law" continues to drive performance for the next 10-15 years through Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, new transistor architectures (like Gate-All-Around), advanced packaging (chiplets), and system-level performance optimizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:29:56">[1:29:56]</a>. This requires the entire ecosystem to innovate collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:31:55">[1:31:55]</a>.
*   **Open Innovation Platform**: TSMC's "Open Innovation Platform" acts as a collaborative ecosystem, akin to a "GitHub for semiconductor IP," enabling the industry to collectively drive innovation forward. This contrasts with Intel's historical closed system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:36:46">[1:36:46]</a>.
*   **Vertical Integration Challenges**: In the semiconductor industry, it's incredibly difficult to excel at multiple layers of the stack (e.g., manufacturing equipment, foundry, chip design) simultaneously due to the demands of Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:51">[1:18:51]</a>. Companies typically add value on top of the previous layer rather than vertically integrate across them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:41:55">[1:41:55]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Collaboration**: The semiconductor industry is a "super organism" where a handful of companies (e.g., ASML, Lam, Applied Materials, KLA, TSMC, Samsung) collectively drive progress. ASML's development of EUV systems was even financed by its customers (Intel, TSMC, Samsung) buying a 25% stake in 2012, demonstrating the ecosystem's interdependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:44:11">[1:44:11]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Risk**: The concentration of advanced chip manufacturing in Taiwan (especially TSMC) presents a significant geopolitical risk. Its disruption would set back the Western world's technology progress by 5-10 years. However, NZS Capital notes that such an event would impact the entire US market, making TSMC's stock performance a secondary concern in that scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:51">[1:19:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

The core tenet of NZS Capital's approach is to embrace the non-linear, unpredictable nature of complex systems. By combining resilient, slow-compounding assets with diversified optionality bets, they aim to create a portfolio that is robust to unknown futures and positioned to benefit from extreme, outlier events, rather than trying to make precise predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:52:12">[1:52:12]</a>. This philosophy emphasizes the [[importance_of_learning_and_adaptation_in_investing | importance of learning and adaptation]] and recognizing the power law nature of returns, where small, long-term compounding can yield tremendous value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:50:55">[1:50:55]</a>. The firm's culture actively discourages overconfidence and encourages admitting mistakes quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:53:00">[45:53:00]</a>.

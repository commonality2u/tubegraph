The journey from part-time podcasting to making it a full-time vocation is not only a career milestone but also a life-altering decision. David and Ben, hosts of the popular podcast "Acquired," have undergone this significant shift, leading to profound implications for their show, their careers, and their personal lives. In this article, we explore their transition, the motivations behind it, and the impacts it has had on both their professional paths and on "Acquired" as a franchise.

## The Decision to Transition

David and Ben have been creating the "Acquired" podcast for over eight years, initially starting as a side project. The decision to transition to full-time podcasting came as a result of the show's exponential growth. David captures this sentiment by noting, "Acquired has been such a slow burn over the last eight plus years that there was not like an obvious moment to do it. So it was one of these moments where you sort of look back and you're like 'Whoa, how am I not spending all of my waking time and energy on this?'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Impact on the Quality of the Podcast

One of the most immediate impacts of this transition is the potential for the quality of the podcast to improve. Both hosts have committed to ensuring that the show remains their top priority. David states, "The show is the most important thing. Acquired is the show. That is what Ben and I love doing. That is why Ben and I are full-time podcasters now and all of our effort is going to go into the show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.

This renewed focus allows them to delve deeper into research, refine their storytelling, and ultimately produce more engaging content. Ben stresses the aim to make each episode memorable and unique: "We're going to make the same number or fewer of even better episodes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

## Impacts on Personal Lives

Transitioning to full-time podcasting has also impacted their personal lives, offering more flexibility and time for their families. The shift has allowed both hosts to balance their professional commitments with personal ones, particularly as they both navigate the challenges and joys of parenthood. Ben reflects on this change by saying, "The life that myself and my family enjoy is because of what you and I have built" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>.

## Influencing the Podcast Industry

The move signals a broader trend in the podcast industry towards recognizing podcasting as a viable full-time career. By prioritizing content quality and deepening listener engagement, David and Ben are setting a standard for independent podcast creators looking to transition from part-time to full-time commitments. During discussions on their strategy, they stress the significance of maintaining the integrity and uniqueness of each episode, a testament to their dedication to their craft and their audience.

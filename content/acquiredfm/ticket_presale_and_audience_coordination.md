Attendees of the upcoming [[acquired_live_show_at_radio_city_music_hall|Acquired Live Show at Radio City Music Hall]] are encouraged to secure their tickets through a dedicated presale [00:02:31]. The event is designed to be accessible to as many people as possible, with ticket prices kept within a narrow range, approximately $100-120 [00:03:31]. These funds are not for profit, but will instead be allocated towards event production, including set design and compensating the hundreds of crew members required to stage the show [00:03:49].

## Securing Your Tickets

To gain access to the presale for tickets, interested listeners should sign up at `acquired.fm/nyc` [00:02:29]. Presale access will become available a few weeks before tickets are released to the general public [00:02:33]. Given the unknown speed at which tickets will sell, signing up for the presale is advised [00:03:13].

## Audience Size and Demand

The event at Radio City Music Hall, which seats 6,000 people, is expected to draw significant interest [00:02:40]. The previous [[chase_center_live_show_event|Acquired Live event at Chase Center]] saw over 6,000 attendees [00:02:45]. Since then, the podcast's listener base has grown [00:02:49]. Notably, New York City represents a larger listener base for Acquired than the Bay Area, a fact that surprised even the hosts [00:02:54]. This count also excludes listeners from the entire Northeast Corridor, including Boston, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia [00:02:58].

## Group Seating and Coordination

Tickets for the Radio City Music Hall event will be assigned seats, characteristic of a theater setting [00:03:18]. Attendees planning to attend with friends, co-workers, or as a company group are advised to begin coordinating their ticket purchases now to ensure they can secure seats together [00:03:21].

The [[venture_capital_partnership_models | equal partnership model]] in venture capital, notably championed by Benchmark Capital, emerged from a desire for fairness and equitable distribution of rewards among partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:11">[03:09:11]</a>. This model posits that anything other than an equal partnership is "morally wrong" for a [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital firm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:19">[03:17:19]</a>.

## Origins with Bob Cagle

The concept of an equal partnership model was strongly advocated by Robert Cagle, a partner at Technology Venture Investors (TVI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Cagle, who grew up in Flint, Michigan, in a working-class family associated with General Motors, harbored resentment towards the "privilege" of older generations in venture capital firms who controlled the firm's economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. He believed in a future where power was more distributed and no single individual could claim to be making all the money for the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

Cagle's conviction stemmed from a deep sense of fairness and a belief in proper rewards for proper work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. He also acknowledged the economic motivation, feeling that senior partners were "taking his money" despite his contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

### Dissolution of Technology Venture Investors (TVI)

In 1995, a New York Times article highlighted tensions within Silicon Valley venture firms, quoting an anonymous source suggesting that if Meryl Pickard had "divided the rewards more equitably," they would not have split up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This sentiment reflected the growing resentment among younger partners in venerated firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

At TVI, Cagle's agitation for an equal partnership model did not lead to a resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Faced with internal disagreements over equitable economics, especially among senior partners who had made substantial money from investments like Microsoft, the firm decided to "declare victory" and dissolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. The firm's partners continued to manage existing funds and board seats, with Dave Marquardt, another TVI partner, going on to found August Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

Notably, even before the formation of Benchmark, Marquardt's [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | investment style]] at TVI shared foundational similarities with Benchmark's approach. He believed venture business was an "intensely personal relationship business" that didn't scale well, and that [[venture_capital_and_founder_relationship_dynamics | companies should handle their own value-added services]] like PR and marketing. His view was that the CEO is ultimately responsible and accountable, with VCS serving to support and be steady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

## Formation of Benchmark Capital

Unable to convert TVI to his desired model, Bob Cagle sought to establish a new firm based on equal partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

### Initial Recruitment Challenges

Cagle first approached Bruce Dunleavy, a former intern of his from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and a rising "Young Turk" at Merrill Pickard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. Cagle proposed starting a new firm together, emphasizing the equal partnership idea and the emerging internet opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. Dunleavy, though honored, initially declined due to lacking the financial safety net of someone like Cagle, who had benefited from the Microsoft deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

However, internal discussions about the next fund at Merrill Pickard mirrored the issues at TVI, with the "bug of equal partnership" infecting the waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Bruce Dunleavy and his colleague Andy Ratcliffe advocated for equal economics within Merrill Pickard, but likely received a similar lukewarm reception as Cagle had at TVI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

### Building the Team

Despite initial rejections from other established GPs in Silicon Valley, who often viewed the idea as "nuts," Cagle and Dunleavy persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. Their "back was against the wall," compelling them to make the venture work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

They recruited Andy Ratcliffe from Merrill Pickard, bringing the team to three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. Recognizing the difficulty in attracting more traditional venture capitalists, Bruce suggested bringing in someone with "entrepreneurial DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. This led to the recruitment of Kevin Harvey, an entrepreneur who had successfully sold two companies, including Approach Software which Bruce had invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. Harvey found the idea of joining a firm "way easier than starting another company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

The four initial partners were Bob Cagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, and Kevin Harvey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. They sought a fifth partner for viability and sufficient "investment capacity" to build a diversified portfolio, as they aimed for 8-10 board seats per person with no investments without board seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. They recruited Val Vaden, who had experience in venture capital and later in software company buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. By the end of 1994, the five founding partners were in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.

### The Name: Benchmark Capital

The firm was given the audacious name "Benchmark Capital," signaling their aspiration to set a new [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm_strategies_and_culture | benchmark for performance]] and how [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital is done]] in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>.

## Core Tenets of the Equal Partnership Model

The [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm_strategies_and_culture | Benchmark equal partnership model]] encompasses two key aspects:
1.  **Equal Carry:** Each partner in a given fund receives equal carry, meaning an equal share of the profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
2.  **Management Company Ownership:** All current General Partners (GPs) own the management company without having to pay for it; it is always "just given" to the current equal GPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional models where ownership might transition through complex processes, as speculated with Kleiner Perkins and John Doerr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

This [[partnership_dynamics_in_business_and_investment | model reflects a religious devotion to equality and fairness]], coupled with a "absurd amount of self-confidence" from its founders to take on the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. The founders, particularly Bob Cagle, believed so deeply in this philosophy that it was worth leaving established firms to realize this dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

Novo Nordisk is a pharmaceutical company that has specialized in metabolic health for the last 100 years, primarily focusing on insulin and diabetes [00:01:24]. It is unique among large pharmaceutical companies for its concentration in this single category [00:01:16]. As of late 2023, Novo Nordisk has become Europe's largest company, surpassing LVMH [00:02:16].

## The Discovery of Insulin

The story of Novo Nordisk begins in 1921, in Toronto, Canada, with the discovery and extraction of the pancreatic hormone insulin [00:05:31]. The laboratory group at the University of Toronto Medical School involved physician Frederick Banting, medical student Charles Best, a chemist, and laboratory head John Macleod [00:06:02]. Insulin regulates the absorption of glucose from the blood into the body, and its insufficient production leads to diabetes [00:05:46].

In 1921, Type 1 diabetes (juvenile diabetes) was the dominant form of the disease, affecting families whose children faced a death sentence with little hope [00:07:06]. The prevailing wisdom for sufferers was a "starvation diet" of 200-500 calories a day, an attempt to prolong life until a cure could be found [00:07:45].

Banting and Best successfully extracted a substance they called insulin from dog pancreases, and miraculously, human diabetes patients at severe end-of-life stages experienced recovery when injected with it [00:09:46]. This discovery was one of the most important advances in modern medicine, occurring decades before the popularization of antibiotics [00:08:35].

Initially, the process of refining insulin was discovered, lost, and then rediscovered [00:11:54]. The new insulin substance was not a cure, but a treatment that required regular injections, as often as every few hours in the early days, to sustain life [00:10:56]. The University of Toronto, protective against commercial exploitation of medical breakthroughs, licensed exclusive production and development rights for one year to Eli Lilly, a large American drug company based in Indiana [00:13:14]. Eli Lilly was also required to share any manufacturing advances back with the University of Toronto [00:15:26].

Eli Lilly found an abundant supply of animal pancreases from cow and pig meat production centers in the American Heartland, which were typically waste products [00:14:15]. This insulin moment greatly accelerated Eli Lilly, making it one of the first leading American and international pharmaceutical companies [00:16:16].

## Danish Origins: Nordisk Insulin

The 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of insulin was awarded to Banting and Macleod, not Best, a decision later acknowledged by the Nobel Committee as a mistake [00:06:25]. The actual nomination for the prize was put forth by August Krogh, the 1920 Nobel Prize winner from Copenhagen, Denmark [00:17:01].

August Krogh, an animal biologist and later a founder of Novo Nordisk, was compelled to find a solution for diabetes because his wife, Marie Krogh, was diagnosed with the disease in 1920 [00:19:12]. Marie Krogh herself was a physician, the first woman in Denmark to earn a doctorate in medicine [00:19:30].

During August Krogh's international lecture tour in 1922, he and Marie met with Elliot Joslin in Boston, the inventor of the starvation diet and a leading diabetes physician [00:21:26]. Joslin informed them about the insulin discovery in Toronto, news that had not yet reached Europe [00:21:47]. The Kroghs contacted Macleod, who invited August to observe the insulin production process in Toronto [00:22:22].

The University of Toronto's insulin committee granted Krogh and Marie, along with their Danish physician Hans Christian Hagedorn, the rights to bring insulin production to Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Denmark) [00:23:30]. Notably, at this time, drugs could not be patented in Denmark, making the legal binding of such rights irrelevant there [00:23:50].

Upon their return to Copenhagen, the Kroghs and Hagedorn immediately began extracting insulin from cow pancreases at August Krogh's lab [00:24:30]. By the summer of 1923, partnering with August Kongsted, owner of the Lion Chemical Factory, they successfully produced enough insulin for human trials [00:27:17]. Hagedorn then resigned his medical post to focus full-time on this project [00:28:36].

In 1924, Krogh, Hagedorn, and Kongsted agreed to establish a new, independent institution to produce and distribute insulin throughout Europe [00:33:22]. They structured it as an operating company, 100% owned and controlled by a nonprofit foundation, with themselves as board members and Hagedorn as day-to-day head [00:34:07]. This unique corporate structure, still largely in place today, significantly impacts the company's incentives and product development [00:34:20]. The foundation's dual mission was to produce insulin and sell it at cost in Scandinavia to maximize public health benefit, and to export it elsewhere at market prices, using those profits to fund further diabetes research [00:35:47]. The company was named Nordisk Insulin, meaning "Nordic Insulin" [00:37:16].

## The Birth of Novo and Bitter Rivalry

Among the first employees of the insulin project were brothers Harold and Thorvald Pedersen, engineers and tinkerers [00:37:35]. Harold built mechanical devices for the experiments, and Thorvald, a seasoned factory operations manager and trained pharmacist, was brought in to scale mass production [00:38:05]. However, within six months, a schism emerged between Hagedorn and Thorvald over who was in charge, leading to Thorvald's firing [00:39:15]. Harold resigned in solidarity [00:39:49].

Utilizing the fact that drugs could not be patented in Denmark, the Pedersen brothers, undeterred, went on to found a new insulin company down the street in Copenhagen, Insulin Novo [00:40:40]. For the next 65 years, Nordisk and Novo would engage in fierce, head-to-head competition [00:40:53].

### Innovation Driven by Competition
This intense local competition drove significant innovation:
*   **Liquid Insulin**: Novo quickly developed shelf-stable liquid insulin, a significant improvement over Nordisk's solid tablets that patients had to dissolve [00:47:23]. Novo sold it at half the price per dose due to its more efficient production process [00:47:48].
*   **Longer-Lasting Insulin (NPH)**: Nordisk retaliated by developing a new, longer-lasting form of insulin called Protamine Insulin, or NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn), named after HC Hagedorn who led its research [00:48:26]. This stable form required fewer daily injections [00:48:54]. Nordisk licensed NPH to other pharmaceutical companies globally, including Eli Lilly, but famously refused to license it to Novo [00:49:03].
*   **Improved Protamine Insulin**: Novo, undeterred, worked around Nordisk's patents and developed their own improved version of protamine insulin [00:49:52]. This led to a lawsuit that went all the way to the Danish Supreme Court, where Hagedorn himself represented Nordisk and won [00:50:59].

### World War II and Novo's Ascendance
As World War II began in 1939, Denmark was invaded and occupied by the Nazis in April 1940 [00:51:29]. Insulin production in Denmark continued unimpeded due to the lack of destruction [00:52:44]. Nordisk's strategy relied on international licensing revenue from Allied countries, which ceased overnight due to the occupation, effectively putting them into hibernation mode [00:52:55]. Novo, however, had been scaling production across Europe [00:53:42]. Under Nazi direction, Insulin Novo became the official insulin provider for all of Nazi-occupied Europe, massively expanding its production and supply [00:53:49]. While ethically complicated, this move prevented millions of diabetics in Europe from dying [00:55:16]. After the war, the Danish state required Novo to repay most of the war-time profits [00:55:46].

Regardless, Novo emerged from the war as a scaled pharmaceutical company and the largest producer of insulin in Europe [00:56:06]. This provided the resources to build robust scientific and R&D divisions, rivaling Nordisk's pre-war stature [00:56:17]. Novo subsequently developed Lent Insulin in the 1970s, a slower-acting basal insulin that stabilized blood sugar throughout the day [00:56:30]. Eli Lilly licensed this Lenta insulin from Novo, making it part of their flagship offerings [00:58:13]. Novo also introduced MC insulin (monocomponent insulin) in the 1970s, the first 100% pure, zero-antibody potential insulin [00:59:50].

Novo diversified into the enzymes business (e.g., laundry detergent enzymes), which was capital-intensive and less profitable [01:00:50]. In the 1970s, the enzyme market crashed, leaving Novo short on capital for crucial capex upgrades needed for its insulin business [01:02:02].

## The Merger: Novo Nordisk (1989)

In the early 1970s, Novo approached Nordisk about a merger, but the offer was rejected [01:02:44]. Nordisk's new CEO, Henry Brennum, a "lumber guy" with no prior Pharma experience, convinced his board that the new MC insulin technology presented a "golden opportunity" for Nordisk to re-enter the market aggressively [01:03:14]. He saw that Novo would be delayed in transitioning to MC insulin due to capex issues [01:04:31]. Brennum pushed Nordisk to use its capital reserves to rebuild production capacity, hire a global salesforce, and directly enter the American market, which was the largest for diabetes [01:04:50]. This bold strategy worked, with Nordisk's sales growing at 30% compounded annually throughout the 1970s [01:07:07]. By 1980, Nordisk, though still smaller than Novo, became the number three global player in insulin, behind Eli Lilly and Novo [01:07:19].

### The Recombinant DNA Revolution
A pivotal moment arrived in 1980 when Genentech and Eli Lilly partnered to genetically engineer human insulin using recombinant DNA [01:14:46]. This breakthrough not only eliminated the reliance on animal pancreases (which by 1980, required 1 million animals annually for 30,000 patients [01:26:30]), but also produced human insulin chemically identical to that produced naturally by the body [01:15:25]. Insulin was the first drug to be genetically engineered, launching the biotech market [01:15:05].

The announcement in 1980 created a "bombshell" in the industry [01:18:02]. Novo, having previously turned down Genentech, scrambled to catch up [01:16:51]. They attempted to chemically modify pig insulin to be identical to human insulin, a costly endeavor that ultimately failed to offer significant clinical advantages [01:17:11]. Despite this, Novo used the hype to conduct a successful US IPO with Goldman Sachs in 1980, raising $100 million [01:19:10].

Nordisk, meanwhile, took a "wait and see" approach on human insulin itself, but invested heavily in building its own recombinant DNA capabilities for production [01:19:41]. This strategy paid off, and by 1984, Nordisk became the number three global player in insulin, passing Hoechst [01:20:15]. Nordisk also listed shares on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, allowing outside investors while the foundation retained majority control [01:20:42]. By the end of the 1980s, Nordisk held 20% global market share in insulin, closing in on Novo's 30% [01:20:58].

In January 1989, with both companies on a much more equal footing and recognizing the increasing importance of scale for R&D, trials, approval, and market negotiation due to genetic engineering, the Novo Nordisk merger was finally announced [01:21:20]. The two operating companies and their respective foundations merged [01:32:32]. The final ownership ratio was approximately 62% Novo and 38% Nordisk [01:32:49]. The combined company instantly held roughly $1 billion in insulin revenue and 50% global market share [01:33:27].

At the time, Wall Street expected Novo Nordisk to be a stepping stone for a further merger or sale into one of the new, large diversified global Pharma conglomerates [01:35:05]. Novo Nordisk management agreed with this plan [01:35:32]. However, over the next 15 years, various merger negotiations fortunately failed to materialize [01:36:09]. Unbeknownst to many, the company continued to compound on the tailwinds of the expanding insulin market, fueled by the treatment of Type 2 diabetics and the increased supply from genetic engineering [01:36:26]. Revenue and profit compounded at 20%+ annually [01:36:44]. By the end of 2003, annual revenue reached over $4 billion, almost solely from insulin, as the enzyme business (Novozymes [01:01:30]) had been spun out in 2000 [01:37:07].

## The GLP-1 Revolution

In 2004, Novo Nordisk management reached a deal to combine with Swiss company Serono [01:37:27]. This time, the Novo Nordisk Foundation board, the ultimate shareholder, blocked the merger, arguing that the company was already thriving and did not need to merge to maintain its competitive position [01:38:39]. This decision proved prescient, as it allowed Novo Nordisk to independently pursue a project that would transform the company [01:40:47].

This project was led by Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, a scientist who joined Novo in 1989 [01:44:01]. In the early to mid-1990s, Knudsen's team investigated glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone involved in insulin production [01:45:57]. The challenge was that natural GLP-1 only remained active in the body for about five minutes [01:46:51]. Despite industry abandonment of GLP-1 as a drug candidate, Knudsen persisted [01:47:19].

Facing an ultimatum from management in the mid-90s, Knudsen developed liraglutide, a GLP-1 analog with a fatty acid grafted onto the molecule [01:48:41]. This fatty acid allowed the GLP-1 to bind to albumin, a large protein in the bloodstream, protecting it from degradation and quick clearance in the kidney, extending its half-life to 13 hours [01:49:50]. This breakthrough paved the way for a once-a-day drug [01:50:32].

### The Gila Monster and Initial GLP-1s
Unbeknownst to Knudsen and in a parallel effort, two American researchers in the VA hospital system discovered that a hormone in the venom of the Gila monster lizard also acted as a long-lasting GLP-1 analog [01:51:51]. Daniel Drucker, a researcher at the University of Toronto (bringing the story full circle) [01:53:28], experimented with the venom [01:53:05]. This discovery led to the development of Byetta (exenatide), which Eli Lilly licensed and brought to market in 2005 as the world's first GLP-1 analog drug for type 2 diabetes [01:54:06]. Byetta was effective, but required two injections per day, making it less convenient than oral alternatives like Metformin [01:54:40].

### Victoza, Saxenda, Ozempic, and Wegovy
In 2007, Novo Nordisk's liraglutide entered Phase 3 human clinical trials for type 2 diabetes [01:55:45]. These trials confirmed liraglutide's superior efficacy and once-daily injection convenience over Byetta [01:58:29]. Crucially, during animal trials and later human trials, Knudsen had observed that very large amounts of liraglutide caused rats to stop eating, indicating an effect on appetite [01:58:48]. This weight loss effect persisted in human trials [01:59:08].

Despite the strong stigma against weight loss drugs (exacerbated by past disasters like Fen-Phen [02:01:36]) and Novo Nordisk's then-CEO's official position in 2005 that "obesity is primarily a social and cultural problem" with "no business for Novo Nordisk" [02:04:19], Knudsen and her team pushed the company to pursue a parallel FDA approval for liraglutide as a weight management drug [02:06:09].

The immense commercial opportunity in the obesity market (100 million medically obese people in the US alone, and over a billion worldwide [02:07:07]) and the chronic nature of the disease, requiring lifelong treatment, quickly shifted management's perspective [02:07:29].

*   **Victoza (liraglutide for diabetes)**: In early 2010, Victoza was approved by the FDA for diabetes [02:08:05]. It became an enormous hit, reaching over $1 billion in sales in its first full year (2011) [02:08:51]. Much of its success was due to off-label use for weight loss, as doctors could prescribe it at their discretion [02:09:40].
*   **Saxenda (liraglutide for weight loss)**: In late 2013, Novo Nordisk submitted a slightly higher-dose version of liraglutide, named Saxenda, for official weight loss approval [02:11:16]. While a hit, generating good sales, it yielded an average of only 8% BMI reduction, just below the perceived "magical" 10% threshold for market tipping [02:12:01].
*   **Ozempic and Wegovy (semaglutide)**: Around 2016, Novo began Phase 3 trials for their next-generation GLP-1 analog, semaglutide [02:15:02]. Semaglutide had several key benefits:
    *   **Once-weekly injection**: Much longer-lasting in the body, requiring only one injection per week, a massive convenience benefit over daily injections [02:15:34].
    *   **Higher efficacy**: Twice as effective as liraglutide for weight loss, showing 15%+ long-term BMI reduction, which exceeded the 10% "magical threshold" [02:15:54].
    *   **Mechanism**: Semaglutide works by causing a feeling of satiety in the brain and slowing digestion, reducing hunger and calorie intake [02:16:49]. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, leading about one in six patients to discontinue the drug [02:17:41].

Ozempic, the diabetes marketing product for semaglutide, hit the market in 2018 [02:19:16]. In 2019, its first year, it generated over $1 billion in revenue, despite being massively supply-constrained [02:19:24]. In 2021, Wegovy, the official FDA-sanctioned weight loss version of semaglutide, was approved [02:19:18]. Its launch saw more prescriptions in just over one month than Saxenda had in its entire lifetime [02:21:07]. The New York Times called semaglutide a "game-changer," noting its effectiveness against obesity and potential to help patients avoid complications like diabetes [02:21:42].

Novo Nordisk's market capitalization soared, from over $100 billion in 2020 to flirting with the half-trillion dollar mark in late 2023 [02:22:11]. Revenue increased from $20 billion in 2019 to $30 billion in 2022, with a 30% year-on-year increase in the first three quarters of 2023, still facing significant supply constraints [02:22:49].

As of 2023, 51% of Novo Nordisk's revenue comes from diabetes-focused GLP-1 drugs, and an additional 18% from obesity-related GLP-1s, totaling 69% from GLP-1 products [02:23:20]. Insulin now accounts for 22% of revenue, and rare diseases make up 9% [02:23:41]. Novo Nordisk makes about $10 billion a year in net income, with gross margins around 84%, higher than typical big Pharma companies [02:24:03].

## The Novo Nordisk Foundation

The Novo Nordisk Foundation is the single largest charitable foundation in the world, with an endowment of over $120 billion [02:59:30]. It holds majority control of Novo Nordisk (77% of voting shares, 28% of economic shares) and Novozymes [01:36:57]. The foundation's formal objectives are stability and supporting scientific and humanitarian causes, not growth [03:01:21]. It distributes billions in grants to life sciences research [03:03:05].

Executives and board members at Novo Nordisk are not primarily incentivized by stock price performance, as they are not given stock options as part of their compensation [03:03:53]. This structure encourages a long-term focus, distinguishing Novo Nordisk from other pharmaceutical companies [03:06:03].

## Market Dynamics and Societal Impact of GLP-1s

The US sticker price for Ozempic (diabetes) is over $1,000 per month, and Wegovy (weight loss) is over $1,300 per month [02:27:30]. In Canada, Ozempic is $147/month, and in the UK, $93/month [02:27:47].

In the US, private insurers' coverage is influenced by short time horizons (average job tenure of 3.7 years), incentivizing coverage only for benefits that pay back quickly or are in high demand [02:28:30]. Medicare (for those over 65) is legally prohibited from paying for weight loss drugs, a ban rooted in the stigma that obesity is a lifestyle problem, despite scientific evidence to the contrary [02:30:53]. If GLP-1s prove to reduce long-term complications like heart attacks, strokes, and kidney disease, there could be a significant ROI for Medicare to cover them [02:32:34].

Payers are concerned about the short-term cost implications of covering GLP-1s, given that 40% of the US population is obese and the list price is over $12,000 per person annually [02:34:06].

### Competition and Future Outlook
Other major pharmaceutical companies are developing their own GLP-1 drugs. Eli Lilly's Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is a GLP-1 and GIP agonist, approved for diabetes in May 2022 and for weight loss (Zepbound) in November 2023 [02:35:08]. This dual-hormone approach shows even greater efficacy in weight loss [02:35:39]. The market for GLP-1 drugs is expected to continue to expand significantly, with room for multiple competitors [02:36:13]. Novo Nordisk has its own next-generation GLP-1s in the pipeline, such as CagSema [02:36:35].

The pharmaceutical industry, historically driven by patents ([[founder_stories_and_historical_business_lessons | cornered resource]]), sees GLP-1s as a new "super cycle" [02:45:40]. Patents cover not only molecules (semaglutide patent expires in 2032 [02:45:48]) but also delivery mechanisms, ensuring continued defensibility [02:47:25]. Scale economies are also crucial in R&D, production, and go-to-market strategies [02:48:42].

The current average cost to bring a drug to market is $2.5 billion [03:11:11]. Pharma is a high-risk, high-return "venture business," where only a small fraction of drugs recoup their R&D costs, and a few "blockbusters" generate the majority of profits [03:11:46]. Novo Nordisk's concentration in metabolic disorders, a market other companies avoided, allowed them to capture significant value [03:07:29].

Novo Nordisk massively outperforms its peers in return on invested capital (ROIC) [03:25:46]. The company's century-long focus and long-term time horizon are often credited for their success in discovering and developing these breakthroughs [03:06:22].

Potential long-term risks for GLP-1s include studies showing increased lean muscle mass loss compared to traditional weight loss, and narratives around suicidal thoughts (though regulators have not confirmed this as a major risk) [03:35:50].

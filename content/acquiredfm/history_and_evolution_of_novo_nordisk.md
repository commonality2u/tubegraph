Novo Nordisk, the company behind the sensational diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, holds a unique position as Europe's largest company by market capitalization, surpassing LVMH in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This pharmaceutical giant is distinct in that the vast majority of its revenue is concentrated in metabolic health, having been "the insulin and diabetes company" for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Perhaps even more surprising, it is owned and controlled by a nonprofit foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

The company's story began in an era before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and widespread pharmaceutical consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

## The Discovery of Insulin (1921)

The story of Novo Nordisk begins with the discovery and extraction of the pancreatic hormone insulin in Toronto, Canada, in 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. A laboratory group at the University of Toronto Medical School, comprising physician Frederick Banting, medical student Charles Best, a chemist, and laboratory head John Macleod, successfully isolated insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

At the time, Type 1 diabetes was a death sentence, with the common wisdom being a "starvation diet" to prolong life until a cure was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. The discovery of insulin was "one of if not the most important advance in like all of modern medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

Using dog pancreases, Banting and Best extracted insulin and successfully injected it into human diabetes patients, leading to "miraculous recoveries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. However, insulin was not a cure; patients needed regular injections to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. The process for refining insulin was initially documented, then briefly lost, and then rediscovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

There was an "extreme culture at the University of Toronto" to prevent anyone from making too much money off this medical breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. Despite this, the university licensed production and development rights to Eli Lilly, a large American drug company, giving them a one-year exclusive license to mass-produce insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Eli Lilly utilized abundant cow and pig pancreases from slaughterhouses in Indiana for production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

## Founding of Nordisk Insulin (1923)

The 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of insulin was controversially awarded to Banting and Macleod, not Best, a decision the Nobel committee later essentially admitted was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. The nomination was put forth by August Krogh, a 1920 Nobel laureate from Copenhagen, Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:01]</a>. Krogh, an animal biologist, would later found Novo Nordisk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.

Krogh's involvement stemmed from his wife, Marie Krogh, a physician and the first woman in Denmark to earn a doctorate in medicine, being diagnosed with diabetes in 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>. During his international lecture tour in 1922, August and Marie learned about insulin from Elliot Joslin at Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. August visited Macleod's lab in Toronto and secured rights to bring insulin production to Scandinavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>.

Back in Copenhagen, August and Marie, along with physician Hans Christian Hagedorn and industrialist August Kongsted (owner of the Lion Chemical Factory), began extracting insulin using the Toronto method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. By summer 1923, they successfully conducted human trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:59:00">[27:59:00]</a>. Hagedorn resigned his medical post to focus full-time on the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>.

In 1924, Krogh, Hagedorn, and Kongsted established Nordisk Insulin, an independent institution set up as an operating company 100% owned and controlled by a nonprofit foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>. This unique structure, where the foundation's dual mission was to produce insulin at cost in Scandinavia and fund further diabetes research from international profits, is still the corporate structure of Novo Nordisk today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:20:00">[34:20:00]</a>.

## The Birth of Novo and Fierce Competition

Among Nordisk's first employees were brothers Harold and Thorvald Pedersen, who were engineers and tinkerers involved in setting up the insulin production line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[37:34:00]</a>. Thorvald, a pharmacist and factory operations manager, clashed with Hagedorn, leading to his firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a>. Harold resigned in solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:49:00">[39:49:00]</a>.

Undeterred, the Pedersen brothers leveraged Denmark's non-patentable drug laws at the time and founded a new insulin company down the street, Insulin Novo, in 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. For the next 65 years, Nordisk and Novo engaged in "Blood Sport" competition, driving innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:53:00">[40:53:00]</a>.

The insulin market was unique due to its chronic nature, requiring lifelong daily injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. Early insulin was "barbaric by modern standards," requiring patients to dissolve tablets in boiled water and inject with large glass syringes multiple times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>.

Novo quickly innovated, introducing shelf-stable liquid insulin, which was also cheaper per dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:23:00">[47:23:00]</a>. Nordisk retaliated with a new, longer-lasting form of insulin called Protamine Insulin (NPH), developed by Hagedorn himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>. Nordisk licensed NPH globally but refused to license it to Novo, leading to a lawsuit that Nordisk won in the Danish Supreme Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:00]</a>.

## World War II and Post-War Developments

The rivalry was overshadowed by World War II in April 1940, when the Nazis occupied Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:29:00">[51:29:00]</a>. Nordisk's international licensing revenue ceased, putting the company into "hibernation mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>. Novo, however, became the "official Nazi sanctioned insulin provider for all of Nazi occupied Europe," massively expanding production and supply throughout Continental Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:42:00">[53:42:00]</a>. After the war, the Danish state required Novo to repay most of its war profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:46:00">[55:46:00]</a>.

Novo emerged from the war as a scaled pharmaceutical company and Europe's largest insulin producer, building up its scientific and R&D divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>. They developed "Lent Insulin," a slower-acting, longer-lasting insulin, which Eli Lilly licensed for the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:30:00">[56:30:00]</a>. In the 1970s, Novo introduced MC insulin (monocomponent insulin), the first 100% pure insulin, which became the international standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:50:00">[59:50:00]</a>.

Seeking diversification, Novo ventured into the enzymes business (which later spun out to become Novozymes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50:00">[01:00:50:00]</a>. However, a market crash in the 1970s left Novo with capital issues for its insulin expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02:00">[01:02:02:00]</a>.

## The Merger of Novo and Nordisk (1989)

In the early 1970s, Novo approached Nordisk for a merger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45:00">[01:02:45:00]</a>. Nordisk, then led by Henry Brenham (a former lumber company head), rejected the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15:00">[01:03:15:00]</a>. Brenham saw the new MC insulin as an opportunity for Nordisk to rebuild its production capacity and enter the American market directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09:00">[01:04:09:00]</a>. Throughout the 1970s, Nordisk's sales grew at 30% compounded annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07:00">[01:07:07:00]</a>, making it the world's number three insulin producer by 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15:00">[01:20:15:00]</a>.

By 1980, the global insulin market was about $500 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:39:00">[01:08:39:00]</a>. The market for diabetes treatment was about to explode due to the rise of Type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08:00">[01:09:08:00]</a>.

A major turning point came in 1980 with Genentech and Eli Lilly's partnership to produce human insulin through recombinant DNA and genetic engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46:00">[01:14:46:00]</a>. This innovation eliminated reliance on animal pancreases and allowed for chemically identical human insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27:00">[01:25:27:00]</a>. Novo's attempt to chemically modify pig insulin into human insulin failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11:00">[01:17:11:00]</a>. However, the excitement around biotech led Novo to conduct a successful US IPO in 1980, raising $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10:00">[01:19:10:00]</a>.

By the late 1980s, Novo and Nordisk were on more equal footing (30% vs. 20% global market share in insulin respectively) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:58:00">[01:20:58:00]</a>. In January 1989, the two companies finally merged, including their foundations, forming Novo Nordisk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24:00">[01:22:24:00]</a>. Novo held 62% and Nordisk 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:49:00">[01:32:49:00]</a>. The combined entity had roughly $1 billion in insulin revenue and 50% global market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00:00">[01:32:00:00]</a>.

Despite being a "specialized dwarf" compared to consolidating Pharma giants, Novo Nordisk's management initially planned for a further merger or sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20:00">[01:34:20:00]</a>. However, none of these potential mergers materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:09:00">[01:36:09:00]</a>. The company inadvertently compounded on the tailwinds of the expanding insulin market and the increased supply from genetic engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26:00">[01:36:26:00]</a>. By 2003, annual revenue reached over $4 billion, primarily from insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07:00">[01:37:07:00]</a>.

In 2004, a deal to merge with Swiss company Serono was blocked by the Novo Nordisk Foundation board, which felt the company did not *need* to merge to maintain its competitive position, citing its strong growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40:00">[01:37:40:00]</a>. This decision proved prescient.

## The GLP-1 Revolution: Ozempic and Wegovy

Unbeknownst to many at the time, a small team of researchers within Novo Nordisk, led by Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, was working on a promising project: GLP-1 agonist drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01:00">[01:41:01:00]</a>. Knudsen, who joined Novo in 1989, began researching GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) in the early to mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00:00">[01:45:00:00]</a>.

The challenge was that natural GLP-1 only remains active in the body for about five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51:00">[01:46:51:00]</a>. Despite industry abandonment, Knudsen persisted, facing an ultimatum from management in the mid-90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:19:00">[01:47:19:00]</a>. She developed Liraglutide, a GLP-1 analog with a fatty acid attached, extending its half-life to 13 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41:00">[01:48:41:00]</a>. This made it a potential once-a-day drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:28:00">[01:50:28:00]</a>.

In parallel, two American VA hospital researchers discovered that a hormone in the venom of the Gila monster lizard was also a long-lasting GLP-1 analog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:59:00">[01:51:59:00]</a>. This discovery led to the development of Byetta, which Eli Lilly licensed and brought to market in 2005 as the world's first GLP-1 analog drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00:00">[01:51:00:00]</a>. However, Byetta required two injections per day and was not overwhelmingly more effective than existing orals like Metformin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:37:00">[01:54:37:00]</a>.

In 2007, Novo Nordisk's Liraglutide entered Phase 3 clinical trials, and in early 2010, it received final approval as Victoza, a diabetes treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:05:00">[02:08:05:00]</a>. Victoza was a "Blockbuster drug," achieving over a billion dollars in sales in its first full year (2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:45:00">[02:08:45:00]</a>. This success was partly due to off-label use for weight loss, as doctors could prescribe it at their discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:53:00">[02:09:53:00]</a>.

Despite initial corporate skepticism about weight loss drugs (with a CEO stating in 2005 that "obesity is primarily a social and cultural problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:07:00">[02:04:07:00]</a>), Knudsen and her team pushed for a weight management indication. In 2007, Novo began trials for a higher-dose version of Liraglutide for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:09:00">[02:06:09:00]</a>. This was driven by the enormous commercial opportunity in the obesity market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:29:00">[02:06:29:00]</a>. In 2013, Novo submitted Saxenda (the weight loss version of Liraglutide) for approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16:00">[02:11:16:00]</a>. While Saxenda was a hit, its average 8% BMI reduction didn't meet the "magical 10% weight loss reduction number" for widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:11:00">[02:12:11:00]</a>.

In 2016, amidst flatlining stock and an insulin pricing scandal, Novo Nordisk's CEO resigned, and Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:01:00">[02:14:01:00]</a>. Around this time, Novo began Phase 3 trials for their next-generation GLP-1 analog: Semaglutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:08:00">[02:15:08:00]</a>.

Semaglutide offered several benefits over Liraglutide:
*   **Once-weekly injection:** Due to a much longer half-life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:34:00">[02:15:34:00]</a>.
*   **Twice as effective for weight loss:** Yielding 15%+ long-term BMI reduction, surpassing the 10% threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00:00">[02:16:00:00]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** It naturally increases the body's ability to secrete insulin, and it travels to the brain to signal satiety and slow digestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:46:00">[02:16:46:00]</a>.

Ozempic (diabetes marketing product) launched in 2018 and immediately became a huge hit, doing over a billion dollars in revenue in its first year despite being supply-constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:22:00">[02:19:22:00]</a>. Wegovy (weight loss marketing product) received FDA approval in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:18:00">[02:19:18:00]</a>. The New York Times called it a "GameChanger," as it was the first drug shown to be effective enough to help patients "Dodge many of its worst consequences including diabetes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:42:00">[02:21:42:00]</a>.

Novo Nordisk's market cap went vertical, reaching over $400 billion by summer 2023, and flirting with half a trillion dollars, while revenue climbed from $20 billion in 2019 to over $30 billion in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:11:00">[02:22:11:00]</a>. Today, 69% of their revenue comes from GLP-1 drugs, marking a significant transition from being solely an insulin company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:20:00">[02:23:20:00]</a>.

## Current State and Future Outlook

Novo Nordisk is a highly profitable company, making about $10 billion a year in net income, with gross margins around 84% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:01:00">[02:24:01:00]</a>. Despite the high sticker price of Ozempic ($1,000+) and Wegovy ($1,300+) per month in the US, the net price is significantly lower due to rebates and insurance coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:30:00">[02:37:30:00]</a>.

The company's focus on metabolic disorders (85% of revenue) is remarkably concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:50:00">[02:56:50:00]</a>. Its unique foundation ownership structure, emphasizing "stability and supporting scientific and humanitarian causes," has profoundly impacted its strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03:00">[03:00:03:00]</a>. The Novo Nordisk Foundation, through Novo Holdings, has an endowment of $120 billion, making it the single largest charitable foundation in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:48:00">[02:59:48:00]</a>.

Eli Lilly has emerged as a key competitor with its GLP-1/GIP drug, Mounjaro (diabetes) and Zepbound (weight loss), which shows promise of being as or more effective than Semaglutide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00:00">[02:35:00:00]</a>. This competition is expected to drive further innovation and supply in the GLP-1 market, similar to the historical development of insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:13:00">[02:36:13:00]</a>.

GLP-1 drugs are showing potential benefits for other indications beyond diabetes and obesity, including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, and kidney disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:02:00">[02:26:02:00]</a>. Novo Nordisk also has an oral version of Semaglutide, Rybelsus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:37:00">[02:53:37:00]</a>.

### Broader Societal Context
The market for weight loss drugs was historically tiny due to stigma and a history of ineffective or dangerous products like Fen-Phen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:35:00">[02:00:35:00]</a>. However, the scientific understanding of obesity as a disease (due to hormonal imbalances) rather than purely a lifestyle problem has gained ground since the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54:00">[02:00:54:00]</a>.

The US healthcare system is complex and expensive, with costs rising significantly as a percentage of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14:00">[03:14:14:00]</a>. Insurance companies' short time horizons (average job tenure of 3.7 years) create misaligned incentives regarding coverage for chronic diseases like obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:34:00">[02:28:34:00]</a>. Medicare Part D is legally prohibited from covering weight loss drugs, a reflection of the lingering stigma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53:00">[02:30:53:00]</a>.

The pharmaceutical industry operates as a high-risk, high-return venture business. Drugs cost an average of $2.5 billion to bring to market, and most approved drugs do not even earn back their R&D costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:03:00">[03:10:03:00]</a>. The industry relies on "Blockbuster drugs" (those achieving $1 billion+ in annual revenue) to subsidize failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00:00">[03:09:00:00]</a>. Pharma's returns on invested capital (ROIC) are comparable to other industries, but top-performing companies like Novo Nordisk significantly outperform the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:55:00">[03:25:55:00]</a>.

The success of GLP-1s, with their long-term usage and potential to address a vast patient population, represents a "super cycle" in pharmaceutical development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:12:00">[03:33:12:00]</a>.

In June 1997, prior to its formal establishment, [[pierre_omidyars_background_and_ebay_founding | Pierre Omidyar]] began working on what would become eBay [00:00:00]. Omidyar, an engineer, was employed full-time at General Magic when he started tinkering with the early internet in his free time [00:02:04]. He launched a collection of internet services under the umbrella name "eBay," short for "electronic Bay Area" [00:02:13]. The website was initially basic, featuring various content and programmatic elements [00:02:24]. One key link on the site was "Auction Web," which eventually became the primary focus and identity of eBay [00:02:43].

## Initial Operations and Unforeseen Growth

Initially, Omidyar hosted auctions for free, with no established business model [00:03:41]. However, the platform garnered so much traffic that his server costs escalated significantly [00:03:45]. This financial pressure led him to reluctantly ask users to pay a small listing fee to cover operational expenses [00:03:48]. Famously, users would send checks directly to his apartment, and he was deluged with payments, indicating strong product-market fit [00:03:59].

## Monetization and Business Development

The unexpected flood of checks highlighted the need for a dedicated business function. Omidyar brought in Jeff Skoll, a Stanford Business School MBA, to manage the incoming payments and effectively "open the checks and cash them" [00:04:11]. This early monetization strategy, driven by necessity, distinguished eBay from other early internet phenomena like the Linux Foundation or Craigslist, which either remained non-profit or took longer to establish robust business models [00:04:29]. Unlike Jeff Bezos, who started Amazon with a full business plan, Omidyar's eBay began as a side project that organically evolved into a profitable venture [00:03:00].

By the time it sought external investment, eBay was growing at 10% per month and was already profitable, generating cash flow from its listing fees [00:07:11]. This profitability meant the company didn't immediately "need the money" from investors [00:05:10]. However, Omidyar, drawing on his experience from previous ventures like Inc and General Magic, recognized the value of venture capitalists (VCs) and a professional board in scaling the company [00:05:14].

## Investment and Acquisition Offers

Despite its profitability, many VCs on Sand Hill Road initially turned down eBay's pitch [00:05:27]. [[the_role_of_benchmark_and_its_partners_in_ebays_success | Benchmark Capital]], particularly Bruce Dunleavy, Bob Kagle, and David Beirne, showed interest [00:05:37]. They extended a term sheet for a $6.7 million Series A financing at a $20 million pre-money valuation [00:06:10].

Concurrently, eBay received a competing acquisition offer of $50 million from Knight Ridder, a major newspaper conglomerate [00:06:32]. This offer was compelling, especially for a two-person company that was barely formalized [00:07:33]. To incentivize Omidyar and Skoll to reject the acquisition and continue building the company, [[the_role_of_benchmark_and_its_partners_in_ebays_success | Benchmark]] reportedly structured equity-backed loans totaling $1.5 million ($750,000 each) to the founders [00:09:07]. While details vary and remain somewhat debated, this "secondary" transaction was highly unconventional at the time, allowing entrepreneurs to take some money off the table without selling their company outright [00:09:57]. This move ensured that the founders had a personal financial incentive to grow eBay into a much larger enterprise [00:10:47].

## Post-Investment Success

The [[benchmarks_investment_in_ebay | Benchmark investment]] closed in the summer of 1997 [00:11:29]. Within a little over a year, in September 1998, eBay went public [00:11:37]. During this period, [[the_role_of_benchmark_and_its_partners_in_ebays_success | Benchmark]] and David Beirne were instrumental in recruiting Meg Whitman from Hasbro to serve as CEO [00:11:43].

At the time of eBay's IPO in September 1998, [[benchmarks_investment_in_ebay | Benchmark's]] initial $6.7 million investment was valued at $400 million [00:12:11]. By the time the lockup period expired in the spring of 1999, their stake had surged to over $4 billion [00:12:28]. This represented an approximate 50x return on their $85 million fund, yielding $4 billion in distributed returns to their limited partners [00:13:30]. This monumental success from eBay's early monetization and growth laid the foundation for its future as a dominant force in e-commerce.

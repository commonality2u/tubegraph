Klarna, a company founded 19 years ago in Stockholm, Sweden, has evolved from a "buy now pay later" (BNPL) service into a broader payment and financial services provider with global ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Initially known for its BNPL offering, Klarna now serves 150 million consumers globally, processing 2 million payments daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The company's vision is to become a global digital financial assistant for its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

## Early Market Expansion and Strategy
Klarna's founding insight stemmed from the traditional "bill me" or "open invoice" option prevalent in mail-order catalog businesses in Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This allowed consumers to receive and inspect products before paying, fostering trust, especially in a country where debit cards were more common than credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The ability to "buy now, pay later" provided safety and trust to consumers in early e-commerce, where paying online felt risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

After finding rapid profitability and traction in Sweden, Klarna expanded to neighboring Nordic countries like Norway and Finland, driven partly by the demand from Swedish e-commerce merchants already active there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The next strategic markets were Germany and the Netherlands, chosen due to their strong existing tradition of invoice-based payments, known as "Rechnungskauf" in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

## Entry into UK and US Markets

Initially, Klarna was hesitant to enter the UK and US markets, believing that the high prevalence of credit cards in those regions meant there was "no need" for their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This perspective shifted around 2015 when a small Klarna team was deployed to the UK to "dip their toes" into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Despite initial resistance from leadership, the UK team identified a significant opportunity for BNPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

The key realization was that a new generation of card users primarily used debit cards, not credit cards, or disliked credit cards due to concerns about debt and practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. This demographic, often referred to as "self-aware avoiders" by McKinsey, sought simple, transparent fees, and avoidance of mishaps that trigger fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. The 2007 financial crisis further fueled this shift, creating a "massive boom" in debit card usage and a new online shopper segment primed for Klarna's original Swedish model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This demonstrated the impact of [[Cultural influences and global expansion strategies | cultural influences]] on payment preferences.

## Strategic Shifts and Competition

### Competing with Payment Service Providers
From 2010 to 2015, Klarna also attempted to "close the loop" by becoming a merchant acquirer and payment service provider (PSP), aiming to compete with companies like [[business_strategy_and_diversification_at_plaid | Stripe]] and Adyen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. While their "Klarna Checkout" product was highly successful in the Nordics, processing over 50% of all online transactions at one point, it struggled to expand internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. Shopify's dominance in the US and its decision to develop its own checkout further hindered Klarna's PSP ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

### Pivot to Consumer-Centric Growth
Around 2015, Klarna made a crucial pivot. Recognizing their struggle to win on the merchant acquiring side against faster-executing competitors, they shifted focus to winning on the consumer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. This involved a long-term vision of becoming a global digital financial assistant for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

Two key components underpinned this new global strategy:
1.  **Global Distribution**: Achieving global scale was deemed essential to operate such a service, necessitating expansion into numerous countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
2.  **Data**: Accumulating more data about consumers' transactions and financial lives was seen as critical to providing valuable advice and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

### SKU-Level Data as a Differentiator
A unique advantage Klarna possessed from its origins as an open invoice business was the collection of SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) level data on every purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. Unlike credit card networks like [[Visas Global Expansion and Strategic Partnerships | Visa]], which typically only receive the amount and merchant name, Klarna knows exactly what a customer bought (e.g., "this sweater of this color of this size") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. This rich data, along with the consumer's consent, allows Klarna to provide more personalized insights and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.

### Overcoming US Market Challenges
In the US, Klarna faced fierce competition from Afterpay, which gained significant momentum by signing major retailers like Urban Outfitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. Merchants preferred to go with the perceived "market leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>. To counter this, Klarna innovated by focusing on its consumer app and "everywhere" shopping. They introduced a browser within their app that allows users to generate one-time [[Visas Global Expansion and Strategic Partnerships | Visa]] cards, enabling them to shop with Klarna at any online retailer, even those not directly integrated with Klarna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. This "browser hack" also allowed Klarna to continue collecting SKU-level data, even for transactions occurring outside direct merchant integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.

By promoting its app downloads and demonstrating its "everywhere" usability, Klarna effectively shifted the narrative from being second on the merchant side to being a "winner" on the consumer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. This strategy helped them sign major US retailers like Sephora and Macy's, turning the tide in the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.

## Current State and Future Vision

Today, Klarna continues to push its "pay now" and "pay later" options, with debit transactions now accounting for about 35% of its volume, especially in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. The goal is a 50/50 split online and an 80/20 debit/credit split in stores for a "long-term healthy proportion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

Klarna's global expansion strategy is rooted in the belief that future financial services will be dominated by a few large, global players acting as digital financial assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. The company aims to achieve this by leveraging its extensive SKU-level data, focusing on global distribution, and continuously innovating, including the integration of AI to enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. Klarna believes this approach will allow them to produce significantly higher revenue per employee than historical benchmarks, challenging incumbent traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.

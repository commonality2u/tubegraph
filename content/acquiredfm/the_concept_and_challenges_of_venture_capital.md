From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The concept of venture capital (VC) is viewed by Charlie Munger as a "very legitimate business" when executed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. It involves giving the right people power, nurturing them, and providing assistance with business operations without excessive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>. However, Munger also expressed strong opinions on how venture capital is currently being practiced.

## Perceived Challenges and Criticisms of Venture Capital

Charlie Munger believes the role of venture capital in society is "very poorly done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>. His criticisms include:

*   **Gambling-like Nature**: Many venture capital deals become "hot," requiring quick decisions, which Munger likens to "gambling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>. This implies a lack of thorough due diligence or a focus on short-term trends rather than long-term value, connecting to the [[probabilistic_nature_of_venture_capital | probabilistic nature of venture capital]].
*   **Misalignment of Interests**: A significant issue is the perceived relationship between venture capitalists and the entrepreneurs they fund. Munger states that people working in businesses with venture capital financing often "hate the Venture capis" because they believe VCs are primarily "taking care of themselves" rather than acting as true partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>. This points to problems within [[venture_capital_partnership_models | venture capital partnership models]].
*   **High Fees and Poor Returns**: Munger criticizes the fee structures common in venture capital, such as charging "two points off the top plus the [carry]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>. He argues that while these fees enable VCs to make "very handsome loadings themselves," the endowments and large pools of capital they manage are "not getting a good return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>. He suggests that charging such high fees is only justifiable if one is going to "achieve very unusual results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>, which he believes is rare, leading to the attraction of "the wrong people" to the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>. This highlights [[challenges_in_establishing_a_new_venture_capital_firm | challenges in establishing a new venture capital firm]] and issues with [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | investing and venture capital strategies]].
*   **Lack of Long-Term Commitment**: Unlike Berkshire Hathaway's "buy and hold" philosophy, which involves rarely selling a decent business and thus building a reputation for staying with things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>, Munger implies that venture capitalists often lack this long-term commitment. He differentiates Berkshire's approach, where their people know they are "not trying to discard them to the highest bid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Traditional Investing Principles

Munger notes that the success in venture capital, like other asset classes, comes down to "a few really good decisions with high conviction over an entire career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>. He emphasizes that it's "not smoothed" and there's no asset class where one can "repeatedly just do okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:43:00">[42:43:00]</a>. This perspective aligns with [[application_of_traditional_investing_principles_to_venture_capital | application of traditional investing principles to venture capital]] regarding concentrated bets on high-conviction opportunities.

Despite the challenges, Munger acknowledges that the world has become "so rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:52:00">[46:52:00]</a>, even with "fewer bonanzas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:25:00">[48:25:00]</a> available. He believes that the current dominance of a few large tech companies is a "natural outcome" of human nature and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:17:00">[43:17:00]</a>, reflecting [[the_changing_landscape_of_venture_capital_and_technology_investments | the changing landscape of venture capital and technology investments]] and [[the_impact_of_technological_advancements_on_entrepreneurship_and_venture_capital | the impact of technological advancements on entrepreneurship and venture capital]].

## The "Venture Capital Type Play"

Munger himself has made investments that he considers a "venture capital type investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:34:00">[55:34:00]</a>, even if it was in a thinly traded public company rather than a traditional VC fund. His investment in BYD is cited as an example, where the company "put the foot right to the floorboard and played it hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:45:00">[55:45:00]</a>, despite Munger and Warren Buffett initially advising against their entry into the car business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:56:00">[55:56:00]</a>. This demonstrates the potential for significant returns in high-growth, high-risk ventures, illustrating the [[characteristics_and_appeal_of_venture_capital_investing | characteristics and appeal of venture capital investing]].

In conclusion, while acknowledging venture capital as a legitimate business, Charlie Munger is highly critical of its current practices, particularly regarding fee structures, investor-entrepreneur relationships, and the ease with which large returns are expected in a competitive market. His perspective underscores the difficulty of consistently achieving "very unusual results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.

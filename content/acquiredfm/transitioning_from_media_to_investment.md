Packy McCormick's career journey reflects a significant [[transition_to_finance_and_quantitative_trading | transition from media to investment]], culminating in the creation of his "Not Boring" empire.

### Early Foundations and Inspirations

Even in childhood, McCormick exhibited an inclination towards writing and humor, making small books and newspapers on Post-it notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. He honed his writing skills by intentionally getting into trouble in middle school to write compositions and later crafting funny, well-researched essays in high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This blend of "class clown" and "serious research" would become a hallmark of his later work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

After graduating from Duke in 2009, McCormick navigated a difficult job market, securing a role in public finance at Bank of America, a firm that later merged with Merrill Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a>. While working in finance, he also started "Throgo," a "party bus" company that transported people from New York to the Jersey Shore and the Hamptons, which he used as an example of his entrepreneurial spirit in business school applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Though accepted to Chicago Booth, he decided not to attend, instead joining Breather as its first U.S. employee and New York City General Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

At Breather, McCormick gained invaluable operational experience, from begging landlords for spaces and designing interiors to literally cleaning rooms and managing a sprawling, global operations team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. A pivotal moment came when he and a colleague, Ben Rollert, developed a detailed strategy memo to turn around Breather's negative gross margins, successfully transforming the business and highlighting the power of strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:50">[03:53:50]</a>. This experience, combined with a writing course that encouraged remixing ideas from respected writers like Ben Thompson, set the stage for "Not Boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:07">[03:56:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:43">[04:29:43]</a>.

### The Rise of "Not Boring" Media

After leaving Breather in late 2019, McCormick initially launched "Per My Last Email," a link-roundup newsletter, and attempted to build an in-person social club called "Not Boring Club" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:01">[04:27:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:50">[04:49:50]</a>. The social club was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading his mother to suggest applying the "Not Boring" name to his newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:48">[05:48:48]</a>.

The "Not Boring" newsletter rapidly grew, focusing on a unique blend of business strategy and pop culture, with early essays like "Creative Destruction and the Mickey Mouse Club" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:41">[05:39:41]</a>. McCormick's transparency and commitment to consistent growth were evident in his initial habit of openly sharing subscriber numbers in his posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

The business model for "Not Boring" evolved from a potential subscription service to a successful sponsorship-driven model. McCormick decided against subscriptions partly due to the broad appeal of his content (which might not be company-reimbursable) and the desire to maximize growth without paywalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. His unique "sponsored deep dive" format emerged from a conversation with Nick Abazid at Main Street. McCormick committed to writing sponsored posts with the same rigor and honesty as his regular content, only promoting companies he genuinely believed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This approach proved successful, generating significant revenue, surpassing initial projections of $300,000â€“$400,000 to reach over $1 million in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

"Not Boring" also benefited from the enabling infrastructure of platforms like Substack (which he uses for free, as they don't charge for ad-based newsletters) and Twitter, which provided low-cost distribution and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### The Shift to Investment: Not Boring Capital

The success of the "Not Boring" newsletter and its unique sponsored content model naturally led to [[crossover_investing_and_venture_capital_transformation | investment opportunities]]. McCormick realized that by providing in-depth analysis of companies, he was not only helping them attract customers but also investors. This organic evolution led to the formation of [[insights_on_tech_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Not Boring Capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

[[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | Not Boring Capital]] leverages the "Not Boring" audience for deal flow and value creation. Founders who appreciate McCormick's writing and optimistic perspective are often receptive to him investing. McCormick's unique [[investment_strategy_and_personal_suitability | investment strategy]] involves a high volume of investments (91 in Fund I), relying on lead investors for deep diligence, and transparently communicating his approach to LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This model is heavily supported by platforms like AngelList, which provides the necessary back-office infrastructure, allowing McCormick to operate as a "solo corporation" without a large team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

McCormick's transition to investment reflects a broader shift in the [[evolution_of_markets_and_investment_strategies | investment landscape]], where individuals can build influential brands through content and then leverage that influence for financial endeavors. His "optimistic" and "thoughtful" approach to understanding new industries, particularly Web3, has allowed him to attract a diverse audience, including venture capitalists and founders, and position himself as a bridge between complex topics and a wider understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

Despite the rapid growth and diversification into investing, McCormick acknowledges the trade-offs of his one-person operation. The business is highly dependent on his personal output, making it difficult to take breaks or scale beyond his individual capacity without diluting the core product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. However, he remains committed to the core content and the "don't get greedy" principle, which he believes is crucial for maintaining the integrity and success of "Not Boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>.

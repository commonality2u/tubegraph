Electronic Design Automation (EDA) is a field that provides the software tools necessary for [[the_role_of_electronic_design_automation_in_chip_design | chip design]]. Synopsis, an $80 billion company, is one of the two major players in this sector, along with Cadence Design Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. EDA software is crucial for managing the complexity of modern chip designs, enabling the creation of new types of chips that would otherwise be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It serves as essential infrastructure for the [[the_future_of_semiconductor_design_and_simulation | AI era]] and the current wave of semiconductor innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. No [[AI Builders and technology | AI applications]] would be feasible without EDA's advanced optimization capabilities for chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. In a full-circle moment, Synopsis itself now employs [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] to design its chip-designing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Early Integration of AI

The concept of using artificial intelligence in EDA began with "expert systems." Synopsis's early software, "Socrates," developed in the mid-1980s, utilized this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This system optimized circuit functionality through algorithmic techniques and added "rules" to improve designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. While limited in capability, these early expert systems dramatically outperformed human designers in achieving smaller and faster circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Synopsisâ€™s founders consider themselves "Kings of [[AI Builders and technology | AI]]" from 30 years ago because of this early adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

Prior to synthesis and place-and-route software, chip design was largely a manual process, often done on paper or with basic schematic entry tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The shift from "computer-aided design" (where computers aided human tasks) to "electronic design automation" (where software actively created and optimized designs) was transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. The ability for software to "change a circuit" was initially taboo, as it implied potential bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This required a fundamental shift in trust from designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Modern AI and Machine Learning in EDA

In 2018, Synopsis introduced [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] for synthesis and place-and-route processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. Initially, users resisted, wanting to understand every change made by the [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. However, despite this lack of trust for the first two years, the results were consistently superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. Today, [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] is widely accepted in EDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

The EDA world primarily uses [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] and machine learning algorithms for massive optimization problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. This involves optimizing billions of transistors within a small area for performance, power, and area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. This level of optimization is impossible for humans to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Unlike some generative [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] that might be 90% accurate, EDA tools demand absolute correctness in functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Despite [[AI Builders and technology | AI]]'s role in optimization, extensive simulation and verification steps are still necessary before committing a design to manufacturing, due to the high cost of bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

## Addressing Systemic Complexity and Future Challenges

The continued advancement of [[the_future_of_semiconductor_design_and_simulation | Moore's Law]] relies heavily on innovation in EDA, including the use of [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. The industry has moved from addressing "scale complexity" (more transistors) to "systemic complexity" (how pieces work together) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] plays a crucial role in managing this, especially as designs approach physical limits like Angstrom scales and contend with thermal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

The increasing use of multi-die architectures, like Nvidia's Blackwell chip with its silicon interposer between two dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>, also benefits from advanced [[AI Builders and technology | AI]]-driven EDA. These designs require optimized connectivity and management of physical effects like thermal warpage and cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. This new era, dubbed "symore" by Synopsis, focuses on systemic complexity with a [[the_future_of_semiconductor_design_and_simulation | Moore's Law]]-like ambition for exponential speed and efficiency gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

[[AI Builders and technology | AI]] is also accelerating simulation, which is critical for future design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>. Accelerated compute can provide 10-20x speedups in simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>, with [[AI Builders and technology | AI]] further enhancing efficiency by intelligently guiding what to simulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>. This enables more complex systems, like digital twins of entire cars, to be simulated upfront, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming physical testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.

## Expanding Market and Role

The [[evolution_of_ai_development | evolution of AI development]] and the demand for specialized computing have significantly expanded EDA's market. Many system companies, such as automotive OEMs, are now designing their own silicon or architecting their electronics with the help of EDA software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. Fifteen years ago, almost 100% of Synopsis's revenue came from semiconductor companies; today, 45% comes from system companies that produce end products, not just chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. This shift highlights EDA's increasing importance beyond traditional chip manufacturing, driving a "technology push" and "end market pull" that accelerates innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

Synopsis's acquisition of Ansys, a leader in multiphysics simulation and analysis, further emphasizes the growing [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development | impact of AI on software development]] in EDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. This acquisition aims to deepen capabilities in core business (addressing electronics and deep physics challenges in chips like thermal and structural issues) and expand into system-level simulation (e.g., designing entire cars with electronics and mechanical actions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Ansys provides "sign-off trust" in simulations due to its 40-year history of cumulative learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>. This combination positions Synopsis to deliver an engineering platform for the future, moving from silicon-level to system-level design solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

The shift from representing talent to leading a major media company presents unique challenges and opportunities, as exemplified by the careers of Hollywood titans like Lou Wasserman and Michael Ovitz. Both navigated this complex transition, with varying degrees of success and insight into the fundamental differences between agent and executive roles.

## Lou Wasserman: Agent to Studio Head

Lou Wasserman, a prominent agent, pioneered the concept of artists earning a share of a film's profits rather than just a flat fee. The first instance of this was with Jimmy Stewart for the movie *Winchester '73*, where Wasserman, as Stewart's agent, suggested a lesser upfront payment in exchange for a piece of the back end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Prior to this, artists received only flat fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

However, Wasserman later made a pivotal decision to transition to the studio side. He believed it offered "better economics" to own content, stating, "why take 10 percent when you can have 90" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This led him to purchase the pre-1948 Paramount library for Universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a> and eventually acquire Universal itself through his agency, MCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. For a period, Wasserman was operating on "both sides of the transaction," owning a TV company while still functioning as an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

A long-standing rumor suggests that Wasserman himself orchestrated the breakup of MCA by the government due to its monopoly concerns. This was allegedly a strategic move to prevent MCA, as an agency, from leveraging him once he was at Universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

As a studio head, Wasserman and Sid Scheinberg, his colleague, still negotiated tough deals but were generally "sympathetic" to artist participations, rather than trying to reverse the trend of back-end deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Despite his pioneering role in empowering artists, Wasserman faced challenges when Universal was acquired by Matsushita. He failed to understand the new owners' mentality and culture, leading to a communication breakdown and ultimately his departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:17">[01:32:17]</a>. He found it difficult to adapt from being an "entrepreneur mogul self-employed king of the world" to an employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>.

## Michael Ovitz: From Agent to Corporate Strategist

[[Impact of Creative Artists Agency on Hollywood | Michael Ovitz]], co-founder of [[Impact of Creative Artists Agency on Hollywood | Creative Artists Agency (CAA)]], also contemplated a transition to a media executive role, driven by the changing financial landscape of Hollywood. He recognized that studios were facing significant financial difficulties, with companies like Universal, Columbia, MGM, and Warner Bros. in trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>. For CAA, this posed a threat, as the agency depended on these studios for distribution and financing; their collapse would directly impact CAA's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>.

Unable to produce content directly due to existing guild rules and potential conflicts with CAA's own clients (who ran the writers' and directors' guilds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>, Ovitz sought external financing for the industry. This led to his foray into what he termed "investment banking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.

### Corporate Dealmaking

Ovitz cultivated relationships in Japan, notably with Sony's Norio Ohga and Akio Morita. He became a consultant for Sony, assisting in the sale of CBS Records to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>. Recognizing Sony's desire to own content to complement their hardware (influenced by Betamax's loss to VHS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:55">[01:24:55]</a>, Ovitz facilitated the sale of Columbia and Tristar to Sony, forming Sony Pictures Entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>. This deal, done with investment banker Herbert Allen, served as a template for future transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>.

Ovitz's strategy for these deals was unique: he never requested a fixed fee upfront. Instead, he cultivated relationships, studied Japanese culture extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>, and proposed that if successful, he would be paid an "obscene sum of money," but only his expenses if not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>. This approach paid off handsomely, as he was compensated twice for the Sony deal (records and studio) and later received $120 million to distribute among consultants for the Matsushita acquisition of MCA Universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:23">[01:30:23]</a>.

### Transition to Disney

As Ovitz approached 50, he felt he was reaching the end of his "useful life as an agent" and no longer wanted to be "in service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>. He considered going into public service after a potential five-year stint running a public company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>. After co-founder Ron Meyer decided to leave CAA, Ovitz took the Disney conversation more seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:04">[01:38:04]</a>.

He joined Disney as president, believing it was a "no-brainer" given the board's solicitation and his close friendship with then-CEO Michael Eisner, who had health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:20">[01:43:20]</a>. His goal was to bring CAA's culture to Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a> and implement initiatives like acquiring Yahoo and CBS Records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>. However, the transition proved difficult due to a "head-to-head conflict" with Eisner, who "undercut" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>. Ovitz realized he was "not a very good employee" and preferred autonomy, a realization he shared with Wasserman's earlier experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>.

### Continuing the Model in Tech

After leaving Disney, Ovitz found a "third career" in the digital world, guided by Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:39">[01:45:39]</a>. He noted that his approach to this new career was "not one thing different" from his agency days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>. He continues to "package" young founders with financing and helps them market, monetize, and strategize their products, applying the same principles learned from Hollywood to the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">[01:47:05]</a>.

> "If dustin hoffman says to me, I've got this idea, I want to play a woman in a dress who sees life as a man through a woman's eyes, and he's the motor, he's the talent. It's my job to surround him with more talent, get them money, help them market strategize how to do it and then monetize it so he makes some money doing it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:13">[01:47:13]</a>

This highlights the continuity of the "packaging" and strategic thinking that defined his career, regardless of the industry.

[[Amazon Web Services AWS | Amazon Web Services (AWS)]] views machine learning (ML) as a significant pillar of its business, alongside compute and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While they regularly announce new database features, ML has gained prominence with dedicated keynotes and [[Amazon Sagemaker and ML offerings | Sagemaker]] announcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Amazon's Machine Learning Strategy and Offerings

[[Amazons investment in machine learning | Amazon]] has invested heavily in cloud-hosted ML offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Despite TensorFlow being a Google creation, [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] supports it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. They also offer their own container service, Elastic Container Service (ECS), alongside an Elastic Kubernetes Service, navigating customer preference for Kubernetes while aiming to promote their proprietary ECS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The strategic imperative for [[Amazon Web Services AWS | Amazon's machine learning capabilities]] is not necessarily to be superior to Google's, but to be "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Importance of Data Proximity

A key aspect of [[Amazons strategy in cloud storage and machine learning | Amazon's ML strategy]] revolves around data proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The most critical factor for running machine learning is its proximity to the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Once a customer commits to [[Amazon Web Services AWS | Amazon]] as their storage vendor and migrates their data into [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] data centers, they are unlikely to seek out other providers for ML services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Instead, they will run their ML workloads on [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Google's Position

While Google is arguably best positioned to offer superior ML capabilities due to its foundational work (e.g., TensorFlow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, this advantage diminishes if customers are not storing their data within Google's cloud infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This dynamic suggests that while [[Building AI Models and Industry Implications | technical superiority in AI models]] is important, the underlying cloud storage choice significantly influences where ML workloads are ultimately run.

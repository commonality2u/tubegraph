### The Expanding Universe of Data
Every year, the volume of data produced exceeds the total data from all prior years of human history combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This necessitates a secure "home" for this ever-increasing volume of information, especially as more sensors are built to gather even more data in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Historical Context: Databases as a Pillar of Software
In 2000, databases constituted the largest sector within software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. At that time, the aggregate enterprise value of companies primarily deriving their revenue from databases reached approximately a trillion dollars in market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### The Vision of Data-Driven Decision Making
Bill Gates once articulated a vision where stored data would be analyzed by machines to facilitate better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He emphasized that future decisions, such as diagnosing illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, educating a dyslexic child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, or maintaining an aircraft's engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, would be made by machines examining data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Cloud Transformation of Databases
There has been a strong view that the entire [[cloud_transformation_of_the_database_market | database market]] was destined to be remade, specifically within the [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | cloud]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This shift involved purpose-building for the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> and focusing on the infrastructure layer within the [[the_impact_of_cloud_computing_and_data_on_software | cloud]] to enable enterprises to transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

This article explores various [[Venture Capital Partnership Dynamics | venture capital partnership dynamics]] and business models, contrasting traditional approaches with Benchmark's unique [[Equal partnership in venture capital firms | equal partnership]] philosophy. It delves into the evolution and challenges within the [[Venture capital industry dynamics | venture capital industry]], highlighting how different strategies impact firms' success and longevity.

## Traditional Venture Capital Landscape in the 1990s

In the early 1990s, the [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital dynamics]] were significantly different from today. There were far fewer [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capitalists]], and the technology ecosystem was much smaller [00:10:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">00:10:33</a>). Early tech businesses often lacked the gross margins, addressable market sizes, and zero distribution costs that define modern big tech [00:10:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">00:10:40</a>). This created an "arbitrage" period where innovation outpaced the number of investors, leading to low valuations [00:11:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">00:11:00</a>).

### Kleiner Perkins and John Doerr's Dominance
John Doerr's Kleiner Perkins was the "800-pound gorilla" in the [[Venture Capital Dynamics | VC ecosystem]] in the early 1990s, especially leading up to and during the internet era [00:09:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">00:09:02</a>). Doerr, who started his career at Intel, foresaw the PC wave, investing in companies like Compaq and Intuit [00:09:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">00:09:48</a>). With the advent of the internet, he backed Netscape, Amazon, and Google [00:10:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">00:10:05</a>).

Kleiner Perkins under Doerr operated with two specific stylistic aspects:
1.  **Centralized Leadership** [00:11:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">00:11:41</a>): Doerr was the undisputed leader, functioning as the firm's CEO and its top performer [00:11:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">00:11:44</a>). He aggressively pursued deals but often tried to pass board seats to junior partners [00:12:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">00:12:07</a>).
2.  **"Modern Keiretsu" Model** [00:12:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">00:12:30</a>): This model, prevalent in the proto-internet ecosystem, emphasized deals and distribution [00:12:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">00:12:51</a>). Kleiner Perkins facilitated and sometimes "forced" [[Venture Capital Partnership Dynamics | partnerships]] and business development relationships among its portfolio companies, including Netscape, Amazon, and Excite, to benefit its collective shareholding [00:13:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">00:13:54</a>).

### Economic Structure of Venture Firms
A [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture firm]] typically has two main economic components:
*   **Fund Carry**: The performance gains from the fund, usually 20% of net profits after LPs receive their initial investment back [00:20:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">00:20:47</a>). This is divided among partners based on their agreed-upon percentages [00:19:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">00:19:43</a>).
*   **Management Company**: An LLC typically owned by the founding partners, which holds the employment relationships and receives management fees (e.g., 2% annually of the fund size) [00:19:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">00:19:55</a>). These fees cover salaries and operational costs [00:20:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">00:20:51</a>).

Historically, founding partners often maintained control and ownership of the management company, even as junior partners earned carry in specific funds. This meant junior partners lacked governance or contractual rights to fees, being largely at the discretion of the management company owners [00:21:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">00:21:26</a>). This structure led to "resentment in the air" among younger partners at established firms [00:23:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">00:23:04</a>).

## Benchmark's Founding: A Challenge to the Status Quo

Benchmark emerged from this environment of dissatisfaction. Two firms, Technology Venture Investors (TVI) and Merrill Pickard Anderson and Eyre, both located at 2480 Sand Hill Road (the former Microsoft Silicon Valley campus) [00:16:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">00:16:03</a>), faced internal discussions about their future structures and equitable rewards [00:19:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">00:19:02</a>). TVI, notably, was the only VC investor in Microsoft, investing $1 million for 5% of the company [00:17:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">00:17:40</a>).

### The Genesis of Equal Partnership
Robert "Bob" Kagle, a partner at TVI with a "hard scrabble" background from Flint, Michigan [00:23:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">00:23:54</a>), harbored an "almost religious fervor" that anything other than an [[Equal partnership in venture capital firms | equal partnership]] was "morally wrong" for a [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital firm]] [00:25:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">00:25:32</a>). This belief, driven by a sense of fairness and a desire for proper rewards for proper work, would become a foundational principle for Benchmark [00:26:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">00:26:20</a>). When TVI's senior partners decided to "declare victory" and cease operations rather than restructuring [00:27:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">00:27:44</a>), Kagle sought to build a new firm.

Kagle teamed up with Bruce Dunleavy and Andy Ratcliffe from Merrill Pickard, and later Kevin Harvey (an entrepreneur) [00:39:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">00:39:09</a>), and Val Vaden (from buyouts) [00:39:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">00:39:53</a>). These five became the initial founders of Benchmark Capital [00:39:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">00:39:59</a>). The decision to approach Bruce, who had previously been Kagle's intern, demonstrated Bob's "obsessive sense of fairness" [00:34:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">00:34:03</a>).

### Launching Fund One: Audacity and Opposition
Benchmark's name itself was "audacious," signaling an aspiration to "set a new Benchmark for performance" [00:40:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">00:40:20</a>). They launched their first fund in late 1994 with "30% carry," a premium compared to the industry standard of 20%, positioning themselves as a "premium product" [00:42:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">00:42:19</a>). This move was "laughable" to many LPs, who expected fees to go down, not up [00:42:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">00:42:33</a>).

Stanford University, a potential LP and alma mater to many of the founders, was so "angry" that it "blackballed" Benchmark, organizing other university endowments against them [00:47:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">00:47:21</a>). However, Benchmark gained a key early backer in Horsley Bridge, which invested in Fund One and remains a large LP today [00:43:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">00:43:32</a>). The founders even handed every LP a copy of Jim Collins's "Built to Last" during their pitch, emphasizing their long-term vision [00:49:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">00:49:01</a>).

The 85-million-dollar Fund One ultimately became "one of if not the best performing [[Venture Capital Dynamics | Venture Fund]] in history," returning billions of dollars to LPs and generating an estimated 92x return [00:44:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">00:44:08</a>).

### Early Challenges and the "Swagger"
Heading into 1997, Benchmark faced a "dark" period [00:55:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">00:55:00</a>). Val Vaden, the fifth partner, left at the end of 1996 due to a lack of fit in investment styles, as he came from a buyout background while Benchmark focused on early-stage tech and internet companies [00:51:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">00:51:30</a>). This departure, after the initial hype, led to a "letdown" and concerns about the firm's trajectory [00:50:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">00:50:06</a>).

To regain momentum, the remaining four partners sought to "re-inject" "swagger" and "hyper-competitiveness" into the firm [00:56:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">00:56:09</a>). They recruited David "Dave" Beirne, the "number one executive recruiter in all of Silicon Valley" [00:57:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">00:57:05</a>). Beirne, known for his "force of nature" and "swagger," previously worked with John Doerr as Kleiner Perkins' preferred executive recruiter [00:57:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">00:57:52</a>).

Beirne's first major deal at Benchmark was Webvan, an ambitious "online Walmart" vision [01:01:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">01:01:46</a>). Despite its eventual collapse, the Webvan investment was considered a "great risk-adjusted bet" [01:06:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">01:06:01</a>). Benchmark invested $3.5 million in a $7 million Series A, which briefly turned into $800 million at Webvan's peak market cap of $8 billion [01:06:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">01:06:09</a>).

### The "Miracle Year" and eBay
1997 was Benchmark's "Annus mirabilis" or "year of miracles" [01:55:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">01:55:02</a>). The firm's investment in eBay, or Auction Web as it was initially known [01:13:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">01:13:16</a>), proved to be transformative. Pierre Omidyar, an engineer who had previously worked with Bruce Dunleavy at a pen-computing company called Ink, started eBay as a side project while at General Magic [01:11:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">01:11:14</a>). eBay famously achieved "product-market fit" when Omidyar reluctantly asked users to pay a small listing fee due to server costs, leading to an overwhelming influx of checks [01:14:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">01:14:50</a>).

Most other VCs turned down eBay [01:16:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">01:16:32</a>). Benchmark, however, saw the potential, with Kagle interested in consumer psychology and Beirne confident in recruiting a management team [01:16:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">01:16:48</a>). They offered a $6.7 million Series A investment at a $20 million pre-money valuation [01:17:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">01:17:15</a>). This was contested by a $50 million acquisition offer from Knight Ridder, a newspaper conglomerate [01:18:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">01:18:35</a>). To incentivize the founders, Benchmark structured equity-backed loans of $750,000 each to Omidyar and Jeff Skoll [01:20:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">01:20:07</a>).

By September 1998, just over a year after the investment and after recruiting Meg Whitman as CEO [01:22:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:46">01:22:46</a>), Benchmark's stake in eBay was worth $400 million [01:23:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">01:23:14</a>). By the time the lockup expired in spring 1999, it was worth over $4 billion [01:23:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">01:23:28</a>). This single investment alone returned 47x their entire $85 million fund, yielding $1.5 billion in carry to be distributed among the equal partners [01:23:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">01:23:45</a>). This phenomenal success also led to Benchmark giving pieces of carry to their assistants, making some multi-millionaires [01:26:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">01:26:01</a>).

## [[The Evolution and Challenges in Venture Capital | The Evolution and Challenges in Venture Capital]] (The Imperial Era)

Post-eBay, Benchmark faced new [[Challenges and dynamics of venture capital | challenges and dynamics of venture capital]]. They went from being the hunter to the hunted, now having "targets on their backs" [01:55:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">01:55:31</a>). They were overwhelmed with opportunities, including joint ventures with Fortune 500 companies [01:55:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:43">01:55:43</a>).

Instead of sticking to their original "boutique by design" philosophy, Benchmark "tried everything" [02:00:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:09">02:00:09</a>):
*   **Fund Size Expansion**: They raised a $1 billion fourth fund in the US [02:17:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">02:17:59</a>), significantly larger than their previous funds (Fund One: $85M, Fund Two: $150M, Fund Three: $175M) [02:18:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:04">02:18:04</a>).
*   **International Expansion**: They expanded to Europe (raising a $750M fund, later cut to $500M) and Israel ($220M) [02:18:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:30">02:18:30</a>), recruiting seven new partners for these separate partnerships [02:19:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:08">02:19:08</a>).
*   **Corporate Network**: They established a "corporate network" of key industry executives to facilitate strategic partnerships for portfolio companies [01:58:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:04">01:58:04</a>).

### Missed Opportunities
This period of expansion was marked by significant missed opportunities, which are considered "sins of omission" in venture capital [02:22:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">02:22:20</a>):
*   **Google**: Despite Bill Gurley joining in 1999 [02:22:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:54">02:22:54</a>), Benchmark "failed to pursue Google" with their usual intensity [02:23:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:11">02:23:11</a>).
*   **Skype**: The international expansion led to confusion and hand-offs, causing them to lose the deal for Skype [02:25:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">02:25:01</a>).
*   **Facebook**: Benchmark was conflicted out of the Facebook Series A due to an earlier investment in Friendster [02:26:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:13">02:26:13</a>).

### Course Correction and Refocusing
Around 2004-2005, Kevin Harvey initiated a discussion, suggesting they "go back to focusing on what we all actually want to do here, which is invest in California with the right size funds, do early stage focus only on the game on the field" [02:28:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:24">02:28:24</a>). The firm decided to spin off its European (Balderton Capital) and Israeli (Vintage Investment Partners) operations, which later became successful independent firms [02:30:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">02:30:30</a>).

The firm also saw the first wave of retirements from original partners like David Beirne and Andy Ratcliffe around 2005-2006 [02:31:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:42">02:31:42</a>). True to their founding principles, these partners "didn't take tail economics," making a clean break and transferring management company ownership to the active GPs [02:31:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:54">02:31:54</a>).

## The "Fab Four" Era and Beyond

The core group regrouped with Bruce Dunleavy, Bob Kagle, Kevin Harvey, and Bill Gurley [02:32:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:38">02:32:38</a>). They then began recruiting a new generation of partners, forming what became known as the "Fab Four" era, marked by a refounding of the firm's focus on its core model [02:33:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:15">02:33:15</a>).

### Recruiting the Next Generation
Benchmark's hiring strategy for GPs is unique: they look for fiercely competitive individuals who are also "unbelievable teammates" [02:05:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">02:05:01</a>). They don't have junior partners, so they recruit seasoned VCs in their 30s who have already demonstrated success but are not yet at the very top of their previous firms [02:03:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:02">02:03:02</a>).

Key additions to the partnership included:
*   **Peter Fenton** (joined from Accel, early 30s, strong track record) [02:34:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:14">02:34:14</a>). He invested in Twitter, Docker, New Relic, and Elastic [02:37:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:51">02:37:51</a>). He famously left a baby GP stake in Facebook's fund at Accel to join Benchmark [02:37:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:08">02:37:08</a>).
*   **Mitch Laskey** (former founder/CEO in the games industry, led investments in Snap and Discord) [02:39:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:09">02:39:09</a>).
*   **Matt Cohler** (Facebook employee #5, LinkedIn early employee, invested in Instagram and Asana) [02:41:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:17">02:41:17</a>). Cohler famously stated that the job of a [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capitalist]] is "not to see the future but to see the present very clearly" [02:43:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">02:43:02</a>). This became true with AWS and platforms like Facebook enabling early-stage investments based on data and traction [02:43:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:14">02:43:14</a>).
*   **Eric Vishria** (former VP of Marketing at Loudcloud/Opsware, joined in 2014) [03:11:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:25">03:11:25</a>). His investments include Confluent, Benchling, and Cerebras [03:12:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">03:12:12</a>).
*   **Sarah Tavel** (first woman GP at Benchmark, previously at Bessemer and Greylock, scouted Pinterest, and worked at Pinterest) [03:12:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:56">03:12:56</a>). Her first investment at Benchmark was Chainalysis, a non-consensus deal during the crypto winter [03:14:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:56">03:14:56</a>).
*   **Chetan Puttagunta** (joined 2018 from NEA, successful enterprise investor) [03:17:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:49">03:17:49</a>).
*   **Miles Grimshaw** (joined 2021 from Thrive Capital) [03:18:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:37">03:18:37</a>).

### Key Investments and Performance
Benchmark Fund 7 (2011), with its Fab Four lineup, was "about as close as you can get to speed running in [[Venture Capital Dynamics | Venture Capital]]" [02:47:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:37">02:47:37</a>). This fund, focusing on areas like marketplaces, consumer social, and games, yielded incredible returns [02:51:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:48">02:51:48</a>). Its investments included Uber, Snap, Discord, Stitch Fix, Duo Security, Docker, Elastic, Nextdoor, and WeWork [02:51:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:17">02:51:17</a>). By 2018, Fund 7 was reportedly sitting on a 25x return before fees [02:50:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:11">02:50:11</a>).

Uber became the "bulk of the returns" in Fund 7 [02:54:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:08">02:54:08</a>). Bill Gurley, who had been studying the ride-sharing space, led a $10 million Series A investment in Uber at a $60 million post-money valuation in 2011 [02:56:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">02:56:06</a>). Benchmark's stake in Uber was worth $8 billion in 2018 [02:54:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:15">02:54:15</a>).

### The Uber Lawsuit and its Aftermath
The Uber lawsuit, where Benchmark sued Travis Kalanick, was a "Rubicon crossing move" [03:07:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">03:07:07</a>) that precipitated the end of the "Fab Four" era [03:09:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:34">03:09:34</a>). While it didn't significantly impact Benchmark's reputation or deal flow directly [03:08:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:20">03:08:20</a>), it likely caused partners like Matt and Mitch to step back earlier than they might have otherwise [03:10:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:11">03:10:11</a>). Bill Gurley also eventually stepped back, leaving Peter Fenton as the sole active GP from that generation [03:10:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:24">03:10:24</a>).

## Benchmark's Enduring Philosophy and Playbook

Benchmark's success stems from a deeply ingrained philosophy and playbook that differentiates it within the [[Venture Capital Dynamics | venture capital industry]].

### Trust and Teamwork
The [[Equal partnership in venture capital firms | equal partnership]] model fosters a culture of "unbelievable trust" [03:03:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:06">03:03:06</a>). Because no one has an incentive to claim individual credit, it forces highly competitive individuals to operate as a cohesive team [01:40:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">01:40:12</a>). This setup eliminates the internal conflicts seen in hierarchical firms, where partners might compete for executive hires or prioritize their own track records [01:42:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:57">01:42:57</a>). This strong internal trust allows partners to support each other in taking "riskiest possible decision" [01:47:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">01:47:50</a>).

The model requires "every active General Partner" to bring "equal amount of value to the partnership" in terms of effort and output [01:45:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">01:45:51</a>). This cultural norm of "100 percent every day" [01:46:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:30">01:46:30</a>) is what makes it difficult for other firms to replicate [01:46:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">01:46:50</a>). When partners eventually notch down their effort, they retire [01:46:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:59">01:46:59</a>).

This "culture of cooperation and Trust" also spills over into the [[Entrepreneur and Venture Capitalist Relationship | entrepreneur and venture capitalist relationship]], serving as a model for entrepreneurs to implement within their own companies [01:51:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:27">01:51:27</a>). Founders who choose a Benchmark board member gain someone with "psychological safety in their partnership" [01:52:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:30">01:52:30</a>) who can provide support without conflicting incentives [01:52:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:36">01:52:36</a>).

### Anti-Scaling and Focus
Benchmark famously believes that [[Venture Capital Dynamics | Venture Capital doesn't scale]] [01:53:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">01:53:53</a>). They have not grown their fund size (until the ill-fated imperial era), they don't have junior partners, and they don't have a platform team [02:00:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:09">02:00:09</a>). This "boutique by design" model ensures every partner has "full context" on all activities and receives attention [01:39:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">01:39:37</a>).

By avoiding internal management and career concerns, Benchmark partners spend "90-95% of their time playing the game on the field" [02:20:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:26">02:20:26</a>) – making investment decisions and helping portfolio companies [02:20:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:28">02:20:28</a>). They are genuinely "dedicated to the craft" [03:37:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:49">03:37:49</a>) and "grind" to support their companies [03:37:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:52">03:37:52</a>).

### Non-Consensus Investing
Benchmark is not a "thesis-driven firm" [03:39:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:04">03:39:04</a>); instead, partners are "learning machines" [03:39:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:48">03:39:48</a>). They actively learn from missed opportunities, inviting CEOs of companies they missed (like DoorDash) to dinners to understand why [03:40:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:23">03:40:23</a>).

They are "experimental" in their approach, not strictly adhering to fixed rules [03:40:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:39">03:40:39</a>). The firm's partners often quote Howard Marks's axiom that to make money in investing, you "have to be both non-consensus and right" [03:16:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:02">03:16:02</a>). This is exemplified by their early, non-consensus investment in eBay, which many initially viewed as a "whack job" investment [03:16:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:50">03:16:50</a>).

Benchmark's ability to "break them [rules] when it makes sense to break them" [03:42:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:13">03:42:13</a>) is a key part of their strategy, such as holding public company stock like OpenTable when it was undervalued, despite typically exiting near IPO [03:41:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:50">03:41:50</a>).

### Branding and Value Proposition
Benchmark's "American green dollars cost a lot more" [03:32:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:28">03:32:28</a>) because their brand carries immense value [03:32:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:25">03:32:25</a>). A significant advantage for portfolio companies is the almost "100 percent" guarantee of raising a Series B round, as other VCs "revere Benchmark" [03:33:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:42">03:33:42</a>). This effectively "de-risks" the next round of capital [03:33:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:51">03:33:51</a>).

For founders, having a Benchmark board member means board meetings are not pitches for the next round of capital, allowing for a more "real relationship" [03:36:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:56">03:36:56</a>). This "different motion" compared to other firms in the industry is a key competitive differentiator [03:37:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:16">03:37:16</a>).

### Future Outlook
Benchmark's biggest past successes have been in consumer companies like Uber, Snap, eBay, Riot, Twitter, and Discord [03:42:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:49">03:42:49</a>). While the current partnership includes strong enterprise investors, the firm's future direction in consumer investing remains an open question [03:43:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:51">03:43:51</a>). The next partner they recruit will be telling for whether they continue to pursue "weird weird consumer stuff" or focus more on "high performing SaaS B2B Enterprise" [03:43:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:51">03:43:51</a>). The current [[Venture capital industry dynamics | consumer investing landscape]] is also at a "weird moment" [03:43:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:57">03:43:57</a>) lacking a clear "next iPhone moment" [03:44:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:26">03:44:26</a>).

Synopsys is an $80 billion company that develops software critical for chip designers, known as Electronic Design Automation (EDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. It stands as one of the two major players in the EDA field, alongside Cadence Design Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The software can be thought of as productivity tools for chip designers, much like Microsoft Excel or Figma are for their respective professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. The complexity of modern chip design is so high that new types of chips would be impossible without EDA software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>. Synopsys's tools are considered essential infrastructure behind the AI era and the ongoing [[The future of semiconductor design and simulation | semiconductor design and simulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## Founding and Early Days

Synopsys was founded 37 years ago by Art Deas, a pioneer in the [[The evolution of the semiconductor industry and the rise of the fabless model | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### The General Electric Spinoff
In the mid-1980s, Art Deas was working at General Electric (GE), designing at about four microns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. GE was involved in semiconductors at the time, investing in what was then considered the "factory of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. However, the semiconductor industry experienced its worst downturn in 1985, leading GE to exit the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

During his five years at GE, particularly the last three, Deas and his team developed innovative design tools, including one focused on synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The idea for Synopsys emerged from a "rebellious idea" to take this technology and start a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The spin-out from GE was done with full transparency and support, resulting in GE initially gaining $1 million in value, which later grew to $23 million when Synopsys went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The initial team consisted of seven people, six of whom were former summer students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### The Birth of Synthesis
The initial technology focused on "gate arrays," which were chips with pre-fabricated transistors arranged in rows. Designers would use metal layers to form gates (like AND, OR, inverter) and then connect them to create circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This concept is similar to what later became FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

The team at GE developed a program called Socrates that could automatically design circuits using multiplexers, which, while not ideal long-term due to signal degradation, produced significantly denser circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This breakthrough in synthesis allowed for circuits that were 30% smaller (fewer gates) and 30% faster (shorter critical path) than manual designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### From CAD to EDA: "License to Kill"
Before Synopsys, [[The future of semiconductor design and simulation | chip design]] was largely a manual process, done on paper or with schematic entry tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The field was known as Computer-Aided Design (CAD), where computers merely "aided" human designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Synthesis, however, "actually created something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

Synopsys was part of the transformation from CAD to Electronic Design Automation (EDA), symbolizing a shift where tools could "change a circuit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This was initially seen as taboo, as changes by a tool were equated with introducing bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. The company's ability to demonstrate superior results, however, gradually built trust with customers, leading to a collaborative feedback loop that continuously improved the tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Growth and Modern Evolution

Cine Gaze joined Synopsys in 1998, having first encountered their synthesis tools during his PhD in VLSI design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### The Role of Trust and Verification
The core challenge in EDA, especially with automation, is trust. Initially, designers resisted automated changes, fearing bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This challenge resurfaced with the introduction of AI in EDA in 2018; users initially wanted to understand every AI change, despite better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This highlights the industry's principle of "trust but verify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The cost of manufacturing a chip with a bug is prohibitive, necessitating rigorous verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### Sustaining Moore's Law and Systemic Complexity
Synopsys's journey has been intertwined with Moore's Law, seen not as a natural law but as a relentless pursuit requiring constant innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. The company has contributed "about 10 million x in productivity" to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

The industry has moved beyond simply scaling complexity to managing "systemic complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This involves understanding how different parts of the design and manufacturing process work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. The increasing difficulty in achieving performance gains comes from hitting fundamental physics limits, leading to new challenges like thermal management, warpage, and cracking when billions of transistors are jammed into a small area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### Collaboration with Foundries
The relationship with top foundries like [[History and Evolution of TSMC | TSMC]], Samsung, Intel, and GF has evolved significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Historically, Synopsys received "enablement" inputs from foundries to bridge their technology with customer designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. In the last five to six years, this has shifted to deep co-development, with hundreds of Synopsys engineers working directly with foundries during process technology development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. This "Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO)" ensures that new physics breakthroughs can be handled by design tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

### From Moore's Law to "Symore"
To achieve significant performance gains (e.g., 4x, 8x, 16x), two main strategies are emerging:
1.  **Specialized Accelerators**: Moving away from general-purpose processors to hardware optimized for specific workloads, such as GPUs for visual processing or specialized machines for autonomous driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. This leads to "software-defined architectures" where the workload determines the hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
2.  **Multi-Die Architectures**: Splitting functionality across multiple chips (dies) brought close together in advanced packages, often using interposers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This approach is enabled by dramatic improvements in connectivity, reducing distance and increasing bandwidth between dies, and is exemplified by chips like Nvidia's Blackwell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

This new era is termed "Symore" (systemic complexity with a Moore's Law exponential ambition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. It means abstracting the notion of the system, where Moore's Law-like outcomes are achieved by optimizing multiple components (silicon, software, memory, etc.) to work harmoniously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The greatest power gains often come from optimizing the software layer rather than just the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### Economic and Market Considerations
The "march to angstrom" (shrinking transistor sizes) and the "march to trillion" (trillion transistors through multi-die architectures) both present technical and economic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. The cost of advanced chips can be prohibitive for certain applications, such as a phone chip costing $15,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. This means decisions are not only technical but also economic, impacting the trade-offs in design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

This economic-technical interplay, or "Techonomics," has led Synopsys to shift from a general product approach to End Market-specific discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. The customer base has diversified significantly: 15 years ago, almost 100% of Synopsys's revenue came from semiconductor companies; today, 45% comes from "system companies" (OEMs that sell end products, not chips), a base that has grown from $1.5 billion to $6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Companies like Apple and potentially automotive OEMs (e.g., Ford, Toyota) now design their own silicon, driven by the need to customize from silicon up to the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

### AI Integration
Synopsys itself uses AI to design its software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. AI algorithms, particularly machine learning, are used for "massive optimization" in EDA, such as placing and routing billions of transistors to meet performance, power, and area targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. While designers initially resisted AI's interventions, the proven superior outcomes have led to widespread adoption in production by dozens of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## Ansys Acquisition and Future Outlook
In January 2024, Synopsys announced the acquisition of Ansys, a leader in simulation and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This acquisition is driven by two key reasons:
1.  **Core Business Enhancement**: Ansys's expertise in deep physics simulation (thermal, structural) addresses the challenges of advanced [[The future of semiconductor design and simulation | chip design]] at the edge of Moore's Law, where electronics interact critically with physical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.
2.  **System-Level Design**: Ansys's leadership in multi-physics simulation allows Synopsys to expand its offerings to system companies, enabling them to design "digital twins" of complex products (like cars) that integrate electronic, mechanical, and other physical behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:54]</a>.

This acquisition positions Synopsys as a provider of design solutions "from Silicon to system," aiming to deliver the "engineering platform of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. The increasing complexity of connected and smart devices makes physical testing impractical, thus boosting the importance of simulation and virtualizing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Accelerated compute and AI techniques further enhance simulation capabilities, opening doors for more applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

## Culture and Societal Role
Synopsys's enduring success is attributed to its "passion towards innovation," driven by the challenge of working on the "impossible" and constantly pushing boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This "exponential ambition" is fueled by continuous learning, both from long-term employees and new talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. The company thrives on a combination of "trust and collaboration" with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

As a company now central to the global high-tech ecosystem, Synopsys faces the complexities of de-globalization, energy utilization, and geopolitical conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This expanded role means that companies are increasingly expected to act as "value centers of gravity" and take positions on societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Synopsys adheres to the principle that "they who have the brains to understand should have the heart to help," which has evolved to "they who have the brains to understand should have the courage to act" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

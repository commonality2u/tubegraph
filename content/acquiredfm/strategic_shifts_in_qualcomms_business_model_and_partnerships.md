[[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm's business strategy]] has undergone significant transformations, particularly regarding its operational focus and partnerships, leading to its current market dominance. Today, [[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm]] generates close to $40 billion in annual revenue, with approximately 85% derived from its semiconductor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This semiconductor segment, accounting for about $37 billion of the total, positions [[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm]] as the world's largest fabless semiconductor company, surpassing even Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early Growth and Challenges (1990s)

Following the adoption of CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) as a major 2G standard, [[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm]] achieved substantial market penetration, including a 57% market share in the US and 100% in countries like South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. They also secured massive market share in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

In 1995, the first year CDMA networks went live in the US and internationally, [[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm]] reported $383 million in revenue, which then surged to $814 million in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Despite this impressive revenue growth, Wall Street was largely indifferent, even hostile, to [[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm]]'s stock until early 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The primary reason for this investor skepticism was the significant capital required for their manufacturing operations and joint ventures, which tied up company profits and punished the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Business Model Pivot: Fabless & Licensing (1999)

Recognizing the drag of capital-intensive manufacturing, [[Qualcomms business transformation in the 1990s | Qualcomm]] initiated a strategic pivot in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

In March 1999, [[Qualcomms business transformation in the 1990s | Qualcomm]] sold its infrastructure business (base stations) to Ericsson, a former competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This sale was part of a settlement deal resolving numerous lawsuits between the two companies and signaled [[Qualcomms business transformation in the 1990s | Qualcomm]]'s decision that it no longer needed to bootstrap its strategy by manufacturing its own base stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Approximately 1,000 of [[Qualcomms business transformation in the 1990s | Qualcomm]]'s 9,500 employees transferred to Ericsson as part of this deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Notably, the transferred employees filed a class-action lawsuit against [[Qualcomms business transformation in the 1990s | Qualcomm]] for losing their stock options, especially as the stock was about to experience a massive surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

In December 1999, [[Qualcomms business transformation in the 1990s | Qualcomm]] completed its transition by selling its mobile phone business to Kyocera, a Japanese company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

These divestitures solidified [[Qualcomms business transformation in the 1990s | Qualcomm]]'s new business model, structured around two main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>:
*   **Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QTC):** Responsible for selling semiconductor chips.
*   **Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL):** Focused on licensing its extensive patent portfolio.

This model allowed [[Qualcomms business transformation in the 1990s | Qualcomm]] to generate high-margin revenue from both chip designs and patent licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Their licensing terms were aggressive, often demanding a percentage of the total phone sale price, regardless of the phone's increasing cost, by leveraging their patent ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

This [[Qualcomms financial performance during the dotcom bubble | strategic decision]] coincided with the height of the dot-com bubble. In the year 2000, [[Qualcomms financial performance during the dotcom bubble | Qualcomm]] became the single best-performing stock, appreciating an astonishing 2,621% within 366 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Evolution through 3G and 4G Eras

In the 3G era, CDMA continued its global dominance, largely due to its superior efficiency for data speeds, which became crucial for the emerging broadband internet on mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. CDMA's digital nature was inherently better suited for packet-based data transmission compared to GSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

In 2005, [[Qualcomms history and evolution | Irwin Jacobs retired]] as CEO and chairman, succeeded by his son, Paul Jacobs, who held a PhD in electrical engineering and had spent his entire career at [[Qualcomms history and evolution | Qualcomm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

A key strategic move during Paul Jacobs' tenure was the acquisition of Flarion Technologies for $600 million in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Flarion held critical patents for OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access), which would become the foundation for 4G wireless technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This acquisition allowed [[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm]] to maintain its licensing business model for the next generation of mobile communication, owning essential patents for 4G and LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Although [[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm]] initially resisted OFDMA, favoring CDMA for 4G, they eventually pivoted and adopted OFDMA, a decision that proved beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

During this period, [[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm]] also began developing its Snapdragon line of mobile systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This strategic development positioned them favorably for the modern smartphone era, where Snapdragon chips now power most high-end Android phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. [[Qualcomms business strategy and market influence | Qualcomm]] currently makes, on average, about $20 for every smartphone sold worldwide, including Apple iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## Legal Challenges and "Value Capture"

By 2009, [[Qualcomms legal challenges and patents in the mobile industry | Qualcomm]] began facing increased litigation and scrutiny, evolving from a respected technology pioneer to being perceived by customers and media as a "value capture pioneer" or "maximally extractive over their ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. While they continued to invest heavily in research and development, their aggressive patent licensing practices led to significant legal challenges, including an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

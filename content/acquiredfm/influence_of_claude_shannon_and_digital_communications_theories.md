Claude Shannon, often referred to as "the father of information Theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, played a pivotal role in the early development and dissemination of digital communications theories. After World War II, Shannon returned to MIT as a professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, where he significantly influenced future leaders in the field.

## Irwin Jacobs's Education and Early Impact

Irwin Jacobs, born in 1933 in New Bedford, Massachusetts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, was exceptionally gifted in math and sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Initially encouraged to study hotel management at Cornell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, Jacobs eventually transferred to electrical engineering after a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. He later pursued and completed his PhD at MIT in just three years, finishing in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Crucially, he studied directly under Claude Shannon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This direct mentorship was "extremely unlikely that Irwin Jacobs becomes the Irwin Jacobs he went on to be" without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

After completing his PhD, Shannon and MIT invited Jacobs to stay on as a professor immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Jacobs spent five years teaching at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, during which he pioneered the first course on digital communications in the world, taught to just four students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This course focused on applying Shannon's theories to practical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Jacobs, along with a fellow faculty member, co-authored the first textbook on digital communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This textbook is still in use today and is considered "the Bible of digital communication Theory," distilling knowledge from Claude Shannon himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Founding Linkabit and Early Commercial Applications

In 1964, Jacobs took a sabbatical to JPL (Jet Propulsion Labs) to work on the U.S. Space Program's communications with satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Here, he met Andrew Viterbi, another MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate, and they became close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Jacobs later moved to San Diego to start the electrical engineering department at UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Jacobs, Viterbi, and a third professor, Len Kleinrock, eventually formed a shell company called Linkabit in 1968 to manage their consulting work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, initially not intending to make products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. While Kleinrock departed to focus on founding [[the_evolution_and_centralization_of_the_internet | the internet]] (he was a "founding engineer on the ARPANET project" and involved in sending the first internet message) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, Jacobs and Viterbi continued with Linkabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Linkabit primarily focused on NASA and Navy defense projects, specifically satellite communications, which required highly efficient use of narrow bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. They assembled an "Army of the greatest information Theory and wireless signal Minds in the country" for defense contracting work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. In 1971, Jacobs left UCSD to organize Linkabit full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Linkabit eventually shifted from pure consulting to bidding on contracts and moved into the commercial sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Their first major commercial project was developing the satellite communication system for Walmart, enabling Sam Walton to broadcast daily to all stores and manage store data when public networks were insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This demonstrated the practical application of advanced communication theories in a commercial setting.

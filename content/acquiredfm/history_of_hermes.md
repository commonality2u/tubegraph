## The History of Hermes

Hermes is a name synonymous with luxury, craftsmanship, and timeless style, known for its selective distribution and storied heritage in the world of luxury goods. With roots reaching back to the 19th century, the tale of Hermes is rich and intricately woven with history, culture, and tradition.

### The Origins (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>)

The Hermes story begins in 1837 when the company was established by Thierry Hermes in Paris, France. Initially, the company was a harness workshop serving European noblemen, crafting leather harnesses and bridles for carriages. This focus on equestrian gear laid the foundation for Hermes's meticulous attention to quality and craftsmanship, a value that endures to this day. 

### Transition and Expansion (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>)

Thierry's son, Charles-Emile Hermes, took over the family business and expanded it to include retail sales, moving the workshop to 24 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, its iconic location today. As the company progressed, it began offering a wider array of products, including the first Hermes handbags crafted to accommodate an expanding lifestyle that involved travel and mobility.

### The Birth of Iconic Products (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>)

The 20th century heralded the creation of some of Hermes’s most iconic products. Under the leadership of Charles's sons, Adolphe and Emile-Maurice, Hermes introduced the Haut à Courroies bag in 1900, designed to carry riders' saddles. In 1922, Hermes also created its first leather handbag for Emile-Maurice’s wife, which would later influence luxury handbag design.

### The Kelly and Birkin Era (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>)

One of the most pivotal moments in Hermes’s history was the creation of the Kelly and Birkin bags. The Kelly bag was originally designed in the 1930s and gained worldwide fame after actress-turned-princess Grace Kelly was photographed using it to shield her pregnancy, earning the bag its regal name. The Birkin bag, conceived during a chance encounter between actress Jane Birkin and Hermes's then-CEO Jean-Louis Dumas on a flight in 1984, has also become emblematic of luxury and exclusivity.

### The Era of Expansion and Modernization (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>)

Hermes's entry into the public markets in 1993 under Jean-Louis Dumas marked a new chapter, allowing for growth while retaining family control. As the company embraced modernity, it also stayed true to its artisanal roots, carefully balancing expansion with maintaining the exclusivity and quality synonymous with its brand.

### Defense Against Acquisition (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>)

Hermes faced a significant challenge when Bernard Arnault's LVMH began covertly acquiring shares in the company in the early 2000s. The Hermes family rallied to defend their legacy, ultimately securing the majority of shares in the family trust, ensuring long-term independence and staving off a takeover. This situation highlights [[challenges_and_controversies_in_the_luxury_industry | challenges and controversies in the luxury industry]].

### Commitment to Craftsmanship and Innovation

Today, Hermes maintains its reputation through its commitment to craftsmanship, with artisans working on leather goods by hand. The company's unique business model promotes sustainable growth. Current heirs, such as Axel Dumas, focus on combining tradition with innovation, overseeing expansion into new sectors while preserving the core values handed down through generations, akin to discussions on [[craftsmanship_and_production_methods | craftsmanship and production methods]] in industries.

### Conclusion

From a humble harness workshop to a global icon of luxury, Hermes's journey is marked by craftsmanship, innovation, and a steadfast commitment to excellence. This deep-rooted heritage continues to captivate the world, epitomizing a standard of timeless sophistication and exclusivity.

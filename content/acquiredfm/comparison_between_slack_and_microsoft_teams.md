The competitive landscape between Slack and Microsoft Teams has been a central narrative in the enterprise software market, particularly concerning [[slacks_position_and_future_in_the_enterprise_market | Slack's position and future in the enterprise market]] and its eventual [[salesforce_acquisition_of_slack | acquisition by Salesforce]].

## Market Position and Competitive Strategy

Microsoft Teams emerged as a significant challenger to Slack, with Microsoft adopting an aggressive strategy. According to the transcript, Microsoft actively went after Slack "by name" [[00:10:55]], with internal speculation from Slack suggesting this was because Slack threatened Outlook and the broader Microsoft suite [[00:11:01]]. Microsoft even publicly released charts showing Teams "flying by Slack" in user numbers, notably including Slack's name directly on the chartsâ€”an unusual move for a competitor [[00:11:15]].

Microsoft is recognized for its "phenomenal at distribution" [[00:14:21]], a core tenet of [[microsofts_business_strategies_and_market_influence | Microsoft's business strategies and market influence]]. Teams would often "pop up" on users' PCs even if they weren't active users, leading to questions about the inflation of Microsoft's active user counts, a tactic historically seen with Microsoft's Azure numbers including Office 365 [[00:14:30]].

Slack viewed Microsoft's strategy as a "real kind of threat" [[00:11:34]], even leading Slack to sue Microsoft for leveraging its distribution advantage [[00:43:06]].

### User Numbers
*   **Microsoft Teams:** Approximately 100 million users recently [[00:12:27]].
*   **Slack:** Approximately 12 million users (older data) [[00:11:13]].

## Product Philosophy and User Experience

A key point of contention in the comparison is the fundamental architectural and user experience differences between the two platforms.

### Microsoft Teams
Microsoft Teams is described as being "not architectured the same way that Slack is" [[00:13:49]]. It is limited in the number of teams that can be set up, requiring "really thoughtful" initial channel setup [[00:13:57]]. Teams is primarily "meant to be the hub for kind of all things Microsoft within an organization" [[00:14:17]], serving as the central dashboard for what used to be Office 365 [[00:19:13]].

Microsoft's focus on Teams is part of the broader [[growth_and_evolution_of_microsoft_products | growth and evolution of Microsoft products]], as they consolidated products like Skype, Communicator, and Link into the Teams brand [[00:18:53]]. The strategy relies on bringing a large number of users immediately, even if they aren't fully engaged, then increasing "time in app and engagement and usefulness" over time [[00:19:37]].

### Slack
Slack's growth has historically been driven by "small innovative organizations" and startups [[00:27:33]], growing as those companies expand [[00:27:51]]. It is characterized as a "platform" where integration with various software (like G Suite, Figma, and its 2400 different integrations) turns it into a "hub for essentially an office suite that is comprised of best in class software" [[00:16:01]]. This positions Slack as a direct threat to Microsoft's cash cow products like email and other core applications [[00:16:37]].

The user experience of Slack is often described as something one needs to "try" to understand, as it's "hard to explain" [[00:30:41]]. It aims to "kill email" [[00:33:07]], particularly for internal communication, and increasingly for external communication through features like [[slack_connect_and_external_collaboration_features | Slack Connect]] [[00:32:36]].

However, a "bear case" for Slack as an independent company suggests that as more workflow applications (like Figma or Notion) embed chat and collaboration features directly, Slack could become a "backup" tool for emergencies or broader announcements, similar to how email functions today [[00:48:50]].

> [!TIP] The core difference: Microsoft Teams is a "full integrated system that's best at nothing but best integrated" [[00:21:31]], whereas Slack represents a "best of breed" approach, aiming to integrate with other best-in-class software [[00:21:21]].

## Financial and Valuation Implications

The market's perception of the Slack vs. Teams battle significantly impacted Slack's stock performance. Despite reporting "really strong numbers" [[00:04:25]] and being a "top quartile" SaaS company in metrics like growth rate, net dollar retention, and gross margins [[00:04:50]], Slack's stock "suffered" due to the "threat of Microsoft Teams" [[00:10:20]].

Slack's growth rate was 49% year-over-year in one quarter, dropping to 39% in a later quarter [[00:39:51]]. This was often unfavorably compared to Zoom, which saw 300% growth during the same period [[00:11:58]]. This comparison is considered a "total red herring" because Zoom is easily adopted by individual users (e.g., for personal calls) while Slack requires organizational setup and integrations, making direct user count comparisons misleading [[00:20:18]].

The market "doubted the business's long-term prospects" [[01:16:04]], despite Slack's underlying business performance, leading to a depressed stock price. This ultimately made a 55% premium offer, like the one from Salesforce, "hard not to take" [[01:14:50]].

## Future Outlook

The acquisition of Slack by Salesforce is seen by some as the beginning of an "anti-Microsoft consolidation" [[00:21:01]], where a collection of "best of breed" applications might align against Microsoft's integrated suite. Salesforce, with Slack as its "credible centerpiece," could potentially become a new distribution channel for other specialized SaaS companies, challenging Microsoft's long-standing dominance [[00:24:08]].

However, concerns remain that being owned by Salesforce could dilute Slack's appeal to "younger companies" and "upstarts," who might shift to newer collaboration tools like Discord if Slack's product innovation slows or if it adopts traditional enterprise sales tactics that alienate its core user base [[00:56:59]].

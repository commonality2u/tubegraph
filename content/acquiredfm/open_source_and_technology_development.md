Mark Zuckerberg views Meta as a technology company focused on human connection, rather than just a social app company or website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This core identity allows the company to adapt to different forms of human connection over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. The aim is to build ideal experiences that are not constrained by existing platforms built by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## Building Future Platforms

Meta's strategy involves building the next computing platforms, such as glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The vision for these glasses includes them serving as an [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_and_open_source_on_modern_businesses | AI]] assistant with contextual awareness, seeing and hearing what the user does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. They would also project holograms into the world, enabling social experiences unconstrained by small screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This aims to deliver a realistic sense of presence and physical perception with other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

[[challenges_of_building_new_technologies | Building new technologies]] like these glasses is a "huge project" that Meta has been working on for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. It requires solving various technical [[challenges_of_building_new_technologies | challenges]], including:
*   Developing a novel display stack for holographic displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   Miniaturizing components to fit into glasses, such as chips, microphones, speakers, cameras, eye tracking, and batteries for all-day use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   Creating new RF protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

The Ray-Ban Meta glasses, developed in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, were initially considered a "practice project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. However, with the rapid advancement of [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_and_open_source_on_modern_businesses | AI]], these glasses became a significant product because they incorporate cameras, microphones, and speakers, making them an excellent platform for [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_and_open_source_on_modern_businesses | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Open Source Philosophy

Meta has a strong relationship with [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | open source technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Mark Zuckerberg believes that almost all major technology companies today use [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | open source]] stacks, and Meta's development would not have been possible without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. Facebook was notably the first large company built on the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.

After Google, which kept its distributed computing infrastructure proprietary, Meta decided to make its equivalent infrastructure [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | open source]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. This decision was strategic: since Google already had its proprietary advantage, Meta gained by fostering a community around its [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | open source]] tools, such as Open Compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. Making it an industry standard led to a standardized supply chain, resulting in billions of dollars saved and improved quality of technology for Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

Mark Zuckerberg is not an "[[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | open source]] zealot" and acknowledges that Meta uses both [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | open source]] and closed source approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. He believes [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | open source]] makes sense for Meta given its market position and applies the same logic to [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_and_open_source_on_modern_businesses | AI]], particularly with models like Llama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. He emphasizes the imperative for Meta to build its own core technology platforms (AR glasses, mixed reality, [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_and_open_source_on_modern_businesses | AI]]) to avoid dependence on other platforms, having experienced frustrations when building on mobile platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

## Iteration and Learning

A key aspect of Meta's DNA is its focus on being a [[corporate_strategy_and_organizational_change_in_tech_companies | technology company]] with a strong technology foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Zuckerberg highlights the importance of having technical people in management and on the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The product strategy is less about a specific thing and more about iterating and learning as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. The belief is that by learning faster, a company can build a better product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

This philosophy often means shipping products before they are fully polished to gather feedback quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. This approach contrasts with companies like Apple, which prioritize extensive polishing before release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. Zuckerberg argues that waiting for constant praise means missing opportunities to learn from useful feedback and incorporate it into future versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. This is particularly relevant for new technologies like [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_and_open_source_on_modern_businesses | AI]], where initial use cases are not always clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.

### HTML5 Mobile App Rewrite

A significant example of this iterative approach and the [[challenges_of_building_new_technologies | challenges of building new technologies]] was Facebook's decision to rewrite its mobile app from HTML5 to native in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. Initially, the company opted for HTML5 to enable continuous deployment and a single codebase across various phone platforms, fitting their fast iteration style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. However, it became clear that native integration was critical for a good user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

This required pausing feature development for about a year and a half to rewrite the apps from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. This period was painful, especially as mobile usage was growing dramatically while desktop revenue was shrinking, and mobile monetization was still being figured out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Despite investor concerns, Zuckerberg pushed through, recognizing that "when you're losing, it's usually pretty clear what you have to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. This decision, though difficult, put the company in a much stronger position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

## Open vs. Closed Ecosystems

Zuckerberg sees the competition in the next 10-15 years as an "ideological battle" over the architecture of future platforms: the closed, integrated Apple model versus an [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | open]] version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. While Apple's integrated approach has succeeded (e.g., iPhone's intellectual leadership) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>, he points out that in the PC era, Windows, with its [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | open]] ecosystem, was the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. His goal for the next generation of platforms is to build and ensure the [[Open Source AI vs Closed Source AI | open]] platforms win, which he believes will lead to a more vibrant tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. This openness, exemplified by technologies like Llama and [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_and_open_source_on_modern_businesses | AI]], allows developers to build new things without needing permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>.

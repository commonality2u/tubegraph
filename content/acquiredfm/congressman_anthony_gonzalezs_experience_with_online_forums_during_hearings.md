During his term on the House Financial Services Committee, Congressman Anthony Gonzalez dedicated a significant portion of his time to specific issues, including China work, international financial institutions, capital markets, and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His focus on capital markets particularly involved the GameStop meme stock craze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Engagement with Wall Street Bets

Gonzalez found the meme stock craze "interesting and fun," especially by following it on the online forum Wall Street Bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The committee conducted four hearings to understand the phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

During these remote hearings, Gonzalez maintained two computers: one for the official hearing proceedings and another for the Wall Street Bets forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. He observed that forum members "absolutely eviscerated" every single member who spoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### "Hitman" Comparison

Initially, members of Wall Street Bets compared Gonzalez to the character "Hitman" from the video game or movie, commenting things like "who let this guy in, he looked just like whatever his name is," and "this guy's an idiot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. However, their perception changed once he began asking questions during the hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Legislative Outcomes and Frustration

Despite the extensive work, including four hearings and national media attention, there was no legislation that came directly out of the meme stock events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Gonzalez expressed [[disappointment_in_legislative_outcomes_from_meme_stock_hearings | disappointment in legislative outcomes from meme stock hearings]] because proposed bipartisan solutions, such as shortening the settlement time from two days to one, which could have reduced system risk and potentially prevented actions like Robinhood halting trading, were not passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Instead, a bill incorporating previously desired Democratic proposals passed the House but was unlikely to advance in the Senate, resulting in no real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This outcome was frustrating as the issue became a "political casualty" despite the significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

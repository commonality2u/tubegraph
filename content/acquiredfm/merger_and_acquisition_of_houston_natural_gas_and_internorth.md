The story of the merger between Houston Natural Gas (HNG) and Internorth is pivotal in the early trajectory of [[the_rise_and_fall_of_enron_in_the_energy_sector | Enron]], marked by the ascendance of Kenneth Lay and the introduction of Jeffrey Skilling.

### Kenneth Lay's Early Career and Innovation

Kenneth Lay, born in rural Missouri in 1942, grew up in poverty but benefited from his family's belief in education, moving to Columbia, Missouri, so his sister could attend the University of Missouri [00:00:10]. Lay followed, also attending the University of Missouri, where he developed a passion for economics [00:00:54]. After graduating, he worked in the oil industry and completed a PhD in economics [00:01:10].

In the mid-1970s, Lay was called by his former economics professor, who had been nominated to the Federal Power Commission [00:01:23]. Lay joined him in Washington D.C., serving as the Deputy Undersecretary of Energy in the Department of the Interior during a period of oil shocks and deregulation [00:01:40]. After a few years in government, Lay returned to the industry, becoming president and number two operator at Florida Gas, a pipeline company [00:01:56]. Lay was seen as a "real deal" â€” a PhD Economist, civil servant, and industry operator who had fought through adversity [00:02:10].

In 1982, Lay moved to Houston, Texas, the "Silicon Valley" of the oil and gas sector, to join Transco Energy as its number two executive [00:02:55]. Simultaneously, energy deregulation was in full swing, and surprisingly, energy prices fell for the first time in a decade [00:04:02]. Transco faced a crisis because it had contracted to buy oil and gas assets at ever-increasing prices, which now exceeded market prices [00:04:26].

Leveraging his economics background, Lay conceived an innovative solution: [[creation_of_a_trading_market_for_natural_gas | establishing a trading market for natural gas]] [00:05:02]. He proposed that instead of the pipeline company buying gas from producers, Transco would operate the pipelines and facilitate direct trading between producers and end consumers (like utilities) [00:05:16]. This created a spot market for energy, a massive innovation at the time [00:05:42]. Before Lay, the financialization of energy barely existed due to government regulation [00:05:54]. This initial step was not securitization but simply creating a real-time market where producers and consumers could buy and sell at appropriate prices, moving away from long-term contracts [00:06:49]. Lay's combination of industry experience, economic training, and government knowledge made him the perfect person to pioneer this market [00:07:38].

### The Merger: Houston Natural Gas and Internorth

In June 1984, Lay, recognized as an industry legend, was poached from Transco to become the CEO of Houston Natural Gas (HNG), a large publicly traded energy company in Houston [00:08:01].

The following year, in 1985, Internorth, the largest pipeline company in America based in Omaha, Nebraska, approached HNG [00:08:46]. Internorth was facing a pursuit by 1980s corporate raider Irwin Jacobs and sought to merge with HNG as a "poison pill" to create a combined entity too large for Jacobs to acquire [00:09:32]. Internorth acquired HNG for $2.3 billion, a 40% premium to HNG's stock price [00:10:23]. Although Internorth was the larger company, it was clear that Lay and the HNG team would effectively run the combined enterprise [00:10:50].

### Culture Clash and the Introduction of Jeffrey Skilling

A significant culture clash emerged regarding the headquarters of the new company [00:11:25]. Internorth's Omaha-based management and board members wanted to keep the headquarters in Omaha, citing political connections and job retention [00:11:34]. Lay, a "consummate politician," had no interest in moving to Omaha, preferring to stay in Houston as a "Texas Oil Man" [00:11:49].

To resolve the headquarters debate, the company hired McKinsey & Company [00:13:00]. This assignment landed on the desk of Jeffrey Skilling, a "young hot shot superstar Junior partner" at McKinsey's Houston office [00:13:19]. Skilling had joined McKinsey after graduating as a Baker Scholar (top 5% of his class) from Harvard Business School, where he famously told the dean during his interview, "I'm effing smart" [00:13:35].

Skilling presented his findings to the board in Omaha, advocating for Houston as the headquarters, arguing it made strategic sense for the largest pipeline company in the world [00:14:19]. At the time, natural gas was perceived as a "good guy" in the energy sector, a "pseudo clean energy" and the "next great Frontier" [00:15:15]. It was cleaner than oil, the first part of the energy industry to be sufficiently deregulated for innovation, and a domestic source, appealing to American politicians seeking to reduce reliance on foreign oil [00:15:32]. Natural gas also offered excellent properties for storage and transport via pipelines [00:16:26].

### Ken Lay Becomes CEO

During the fateful board meeting in Omaha in late 1985 or 1986, just before Skilling was to present, Lay engineered a coup [00:16:53]. The prior CEO was fired, and Lay became the CEO of the newly combined company [00:17:19]. With Lay now in charge, the headquarters discussion was deprioritized, and while the board initially insisted on Omaha, the move to Houston happened shortly thereafter [00:17:29].

This meeting marked the first encounter between Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling [00:18:04]. Lay, maintaining his diplomatic demeanor, apologized for the drama and praised Skilling's work on the study [00:18:13]. Lay then asked Skilling to be their dedicated McKinsey partner in Houston, leading future strategic initiatives for the new company [00:18:28]. "And so it begins" [00:18:34].

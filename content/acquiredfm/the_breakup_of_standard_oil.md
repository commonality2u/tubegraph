This article covers the period of [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] from 1890 through its [[legacy_and_breakup_of_standard_oil | breakup]] in 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. It also explores [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller's]] legacy and philanthropy, and how the world today is shaped by his influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. A key debate is where [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] crossed the line from legitimate business practices, like operational efficiency and economies of scale, into abuses of power to grow profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Context: The Sherman Antitrust Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>

In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act had just passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] viewed it as dead-on-the-vine legislation, with nothing to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The key modifying clause in the act was "in restraint of trade," which was undefined at the time, making the legislation seem ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Despite this, [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] had achieved significant market dominance, controlling 90% of the kerosene market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Early Legal Challenges and Corporate Restructuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>

Trouble began brewing in Ohio, where state legislators were upset with [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] and [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. In 1890, Ohio State Attorney General David Watson filed a case against [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]], arguing that as an Ohio corporation, it was violating state laws by conducting illegal interstate commerce through its trust structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

By 1892, the case reached the Ohio Supreme Court, which ruled against [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]], ordering the dissolution of its trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. To circumvent this, [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil's]] lawyers had a pre-existing escape plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. New Jersey state corporate law at the time allowed corporations to hold stock in other out-of-state corporations without needing a trust structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This loophole allowed [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] to reorganize and transfer all its assets into the new **Standard Oil of New Jersey** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

This overhaul was largely "shadow play," a charade to appease the courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. The executive committee was formally dissolved, but its members simply became presidents of 20 affiliated companies, continuing to rule as absolutely as before from Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller's]] Retirement and Philanthropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>

Around this time, [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] began to drift away from the daily operations of [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]], suffering from health issues and the burden of managing his immense wealth and charitable requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. He felt he had perfected the machinery of [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] and his divine task was done, leading him to want to pass the reins to younger men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

At this point, [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] was generating $10 million in annual income from [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] dividends alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>, pre-income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. He owned a quarter of [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil's]] shares and had $24 million invested outside the company in railroads, real estate, and banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. By the time he officially retired, he was worth about $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. He later made an additional $80 million from a U.S. Steel roll-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. In 1902, his personal net worth was approximately 1% of the U.S. GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

He struggled with how to best distribute his wealth, receiving thousands of letters a week asking for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. This philanthropic burden led to a nervous breakdown and physical changes, including losing all his body hair (alopecia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

In 1891, he recruited Frederick Gates to help manage his philanthropic endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. Together, they essentially invented modern philanthropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. Their approach was systematic and organizational, distinct from traditional tithing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.

Notable philanthropic projects include:
*   **Spelman College**: Financed the building of this HBCU women's college in Atlanta in the early 1880s, named after his wife Seti Spelman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] was an abolitionist and advocate for Black rights after the Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **University of Chicago**: Started as a movement in the early 1880s to build a Baptist university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] became involved and, after initial setbacks, the project moved to Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. He deliberately avoided putting his name on the university to prevent public perception of seeking favor for his business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
*   **Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University)**: Established in 1901 in New York City on a Manhattan farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. This institution focused on pure basic research, giving scientists control over expenditures, a revolutionary concept at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. It produced 38 Nobel laureates and contributed to breakthroughs like culturing the syphilis agent, identifying oncogenic viruses, discovering blood groups, developing methadone, and devising the AIDS drug cocktail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. Winston Churchill praised [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller's]] endowment of research as a "milestone in the progress of the race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Modern Medical Education and Public Health**: Working with Simon Flexner, the head of the Rockefeller Institute, they adapted the Johns Hopkins four-year medical school model and spread it to other universities nationwide, standardizing medical education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. They also funded the creation of the first schools of public health at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, then globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

In 1913, the **Rockefeller Foundation** was formally chartered, institutionalizing [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller's]] philanthropic efforts for indefinite perpetuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.

## The Road to Dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>

Despite [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller's]] reduced involvement, the company's dividend increased from 11% to 33% by 1899 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. The share price of [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] also surged, rising from $176 in 1896 to $458 in 1899 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. Between 1893 and 1901, $250 million was paid out to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. This profitability was before the mass adoption of the automobile, which would later make gasoline a valuable product from a previously "useless" byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

### Renewed Legal Pressure and Political Maneuvers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>

In 1897, the state of Ohio again brought charges against [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]], arguing they were still breaking laws despite the New Jersey reincorporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] was called to testify and feigned senility to evade questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>. Though [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] won the case, it helped shift public opinion against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

During the 1896 presidential election, [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] contributed a quarter-million dollars to Republican William McKinley's campaign, who defeated populist William Jennings Bryan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>. McKinley's campaign manager, Mark Hanna, a high school friend of [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]], sent a telegram upon McKinley's victory reading, "God is in his heaven, all is right with the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.

However, in 1898, New York's governor, Theodore Roosevelt, began to challenge the trusts, including [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. In a strategic move to neutralize him, [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] and its allies got Roosevelt nominated as Vice President on McKinley's 1900 re-election ticket, believing the role would render him ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>. McKinley won in a landslide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

In September 1901, McKinley was assassinated, making Theodore Roosevelt president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>. This was [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil's]] "worst nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.

### The Role of Investigative Journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>

Simultaneously, in September 1901, pioneering journalist Ida Minerva Tarbell began working on "The History of [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]]" for McClure's Magazine, to be released in serial form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. This marked the birth of modern [[the_role_of_investigative_journalism_in_standard_oils_history | investigative journalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>. Historian Daniel Yergin called it "maybe the single most influential book on business ever published in the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. Tarbell and her colleagues became known as "muckrakers," a term coined by Theodore Roosevelt himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

Tarbell had a personal connection: her father was an oil producer in Titusville who was "flattened" by [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]], and her brother became a senior executive at Pure Oil, a competitor [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] allowed to exist for appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

Tarbell's work, after a year of research, meticulously documented [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil's]] machinations, including the **Cleveland Massacre** and secret subsidiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. She revealed that railroads were sending information about competitors' shipments to [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.

The series ran for 19 monthly installments, tripling McClure's circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil's]] traditional response of silence, which had worked against local press, backfired with a national publication, making them appear "super freaking guilty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. The profitability of the advertising-driven media model, partly funded by trusts like [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]], ironically enabled the very investigative journalism that exposed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

### Federal Antitrust Suit and [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller's]] Evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>

In 1904, [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] attempted to apply its usual playbook, making campaign donations to Theodore Roosevelt for his re-election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. After his landslide victory, Roosevelt, feeling he had a mandate, stated, "We bought the son of a b----, but he wouldn't stay bought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>.

In February 1905, Congress passed a unanimous resolution urging states to conduct antitrust investigations into [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>. This led to multiple state cases, and Missouri subpoenaed [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] to testify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] went into hiding for two years, literally on the lam, with warrants for his arrest issued by Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. He even sent perpetual resignation letters to [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] executives, who refused to accept them, fearing potential jail time for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>. An executive, Henry Rogers, was quoted saying they told [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]], "If any of us had to go to jail, he would have to go with us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:21">[01:24:21]</a>.

On November 18, 1906, Roosevelt directly ordered the U.S. Attorney General to file a federal antitrust suit against [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] in Missouri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. The grounds were a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, specifically being "in restraint of trade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:55">[01:25:55]</a>.

## The Supreme Court Decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>

After years of legal battles, the case reached the Supreme Court. On May 15, 1911, Chief Justice Edward White read the decision in *[[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] v. United States* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>. The Supreme Court upheld the lower court's decision, finding [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] was indeed "in restraint of trade" and ordered its irrevocable [[legacy_and_breakup_of_standard_oil | breakup]] into 34 separate companies within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>.

White, a conservative and business-friendly figure, used the opportunity to define "in restraint of trade" through his "reasonableness doctrine," suggesting that not all restraints were unlawful, only "unreasonable" ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>. This angered progressives like Roosevelt and Tarbell, who sought to imprison [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] executives and deter future monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:25">[01:43:25]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath and Economic Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>

When [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] received the news of the Supreme Court ruling while golfing, he famously advised his golfing partner, a local Catholic priest, to "buy some [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] stock right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:53">[01:35:53]</a>.

The [[legacy_and_breakup_of_standard_oil | breakup]] was an "inestimable service" and the "luckiest stroke of [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller's]] career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>. His net worth, estimated at $300 million in 1911, grew to $900 million by 1913, just two years after the breakup, due to the stock pops and the shift to the gasoline market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:57">[01:50:57]</a>. In inflation-adjusted terms, this was about $25 billion in 2021 dollars, but more accurately, it represented about 3% of the US GDP, translating to approximately $470 billion in today's terms, making him the richest person in American history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:13">[01:51:13]</a>. He earned more money in retirement than while actively working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>.

The [[economic_impact_of_standard_oils_dissolution | dissolution]] took effect on December 1, 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>. The 34 resulting companies became publicly listed, revealing their true underlying assets and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:28">[01:38:28]</a>. For example, Standard Oil of New Jersey's shares rose from $360 to $595 within a year, and Standard Oil of Indiana's from $3,500 to $9,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:33">[01:39:33]</a>. Newspapers even began running daily box scores tracking [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller's]] net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

The former Standard Oil executives, who were titular presidents of separate companies, now truly were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. Yet, they continued to meet daily for coffee at 10:30 at [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil's]] former headquarters, a defiant gesture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:58">[01:40:58]</a>. The phrase "The king is dead, long live the king" was evoked, as [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] was "dead" but its constituent parts "lived" on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:13">[01:41:13]</a>.

### The New Standard Oil Companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:24">[01:47:24]</a>

The breakup also fostered innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>. Younger talents within the organization, previously stifled by the centralized structure, now had opportunities to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Dr. William M. Burton of Standard Oil of Indiana, for instance, patented a "cracking" process in 1913 that yielded a far higher percentage of gasoline from crude oil, leading to "incredible windfall royalties" for Standard Oil of Indiana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:34">[01:46:34]</a>.

Many of the 34 spin-offs became major oil companies:
*   Standard Oil of New Jersey (**Esso**) became **Exxon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:38">[01:47:38]</a>.
*   Standard Oil of New York became **Mobil** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:37">[01:48:37]</a>.
*   Standard Oil of Indiana became **Amoco** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>.
*   Standard Oil of California became **Chevron** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>.
*   Standard Oil of Ohio (**Sohio**) was acquired by **BP** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>.
*   Ohio Oil Company became **Marathon** (and Speedway brand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:56">[01:48:56]</a>.
*   Atlantic Refining Company (**Arco**) was partially acquired by **Sunoco** and then BP, with its brand later sold to Marathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:04">[01:49:04]</a>.
*   Continental Oil became **Conoco**, now **ConocoPhillips** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:24">[01:49:24]</a>.
*   South Penn Oil Company became **Pennzoil** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:30">[01:49:30]</a>.

Exxon and Mobil, as a re-conglomeration, account for more than half of the original [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] business prior to 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:54">[01:49:54]</a>.

## Reflections and Modern Parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:49">[02:02:49]</a>

The [[economic_impact_of_standard_oils_dissolution | dissolution]] of [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] was intended to increase competition and benefit consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>. While [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil's]] monopolistic practices did at times become consumer harmful by raising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:37">[02:07:37]</a>, their standardization and operational excellence had also benefited consumers previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>.

By 1911, [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil's]] market share had already eroded to 64%, with at least 147 other refining companies competing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:54">[02:07:54]</a>. The maturation of oil discovery and drilling technology meant much more oil was available, naturally driving down their market share regardless of the breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:39">[02:08:39]</a>.

There are strong parallels between the [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] story and big tech today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:36">[02:09:36]</a>.
*   **Market Dynamics**: Just as the oil market changed with the automobile and new discoveries, the tech market constantly evolves with new paradigms like Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:48">[02:10:48]</a>. The idea that "big tech has settled" or "this game is over" has been proven wrong, as new companies and markets continuously emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>.
*   **Innovation vs. Regulation**: Regulation, by definition, limits innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:38">[02:14:38]</a>. Paradigm shifts and new technologies often break monopolies naturally, raising questions about whether legal intervention is always necessary, especially if there's no immediate widespread value destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:05">[02:15:05]</a>.
*   **Acquisition as Monopoly**: [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil's]] roll-up of competitors through the Cleveland Massacre is directly comparable to [[antitrust_and_its_impact_on_microsoft | Facebook's]] acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:54">[02:16:54]</a>.
*   **Corporate Ossification**: The "old guard" at [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] became ossified in their views, failing to adapt to changing realities, similar to how leadership at some large tech companies might be perceived today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:26">[02:20:26]</a>.

## Legacy of Rockefeller's Wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>

By his death in 1937, [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller's]] remaining fortune, largely in family trusts, was about $1.4 billion (1.5% of 1937 GDP, or $315 billion in 2021 dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>. The [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] family, now seven generations in with about 170 heirs, still maintains an estimated $11 billion fortune (2016), largely due to extensive philanthropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:18">[01:54:18]</a>. Unlike the "shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations" adage, the [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] family has managed their wealth with remarkable discretion and continuity, largely avoiding major public feuds or scandals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>.

Many institutions and places that don't bear the Rockefeller name were touched by their philanthropy:
*   [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | John D. Rockefeller]] Jr. financed and directed the construction of carriage roads in Acadia National Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:31">[01:57:31]</a>.
*   He largely funded the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:25">[01:58:25]</a>.
*   He contributed $5 million to assemble land for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:50">[01:58:50]</a>.
*   Abby Aldrich [[john_d_rockefeller_and_his_business_strategies | Rockefeller]] was the brainchild behind the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), built on land that was once the first Rockefeller mansions in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>.
*   **Rockefeller Center** was Jr.'s main business project, attracting media organizations like NBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   Jr. donated $8.5 million in 1945 to buy the land for the United Nations building in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:15">[02:01:15]</a>.
*   He bought up land for what would become much of Grand Teton National Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:37">[02:01:37]</a>.
*   Rockefeller investments also include large areas of Redwood State Park and Embarcadero Center in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:52">[02:01:52]</a>.

The **Standard** trademark was doled out to the 34 child companies, with each owning rights in different states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:10">[02:22:10]</a>. In some states, like California (where Chevron owns it), a few gas stations still carry the "Standard" logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.

In a significant recent development, in December 2020, the Rockefeller Foundation pledged to dump its fossil fuel holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:16">[02:23:16]</a>. This means the descendants of the original oil money are now pledging divestment from the industry that created their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:39">[02:23:39]</a>.

From a pure shareholder value perspective, the [[legacy_and_breakup_of_standard_oil | breakup]] of [[history_of_standard_oil | Standard Oil]] was an **A** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:46">[02:28:46]</a>. It allowed the market to truly see the value of each underlying business and its assets, leading to significant stock appreciation for the constituent parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:56">[02:29:56]</a>. This was the "OG value unlock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:56">[02:29:56]</a>.

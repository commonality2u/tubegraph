Venture firms, at their core, are considered to be a collection of habits, a concept drawn from the philosopher William James, who posited that individuals are an amalgamation of their habits, which ultimately sow character and everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This perspective suggests that firms often create strategies that are not aligned with reality, highlighting the importance of deeply ingrained practices over abstract plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Nurturing Curiosity Through Rituals

At Benchmark, the cultivation of [[the_role_of_curiosity_and_open_discussions_in_venture_capital | curiosity]] is viewed as the "essential lifeblood of the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. To embed this value, a specific habit was needed, as traditional Monday meetings proved limited in fostering the desired dynamic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

This led to the establishment of a dinner tradition, inspired by Ben Franklin's diverse weekly dinners that delved deep into various subjects like finance, chemistry, and life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The firm introduced this experiment around 2006 or 2007, aiming to inject new practices, habits, and ideas into its [[venture_capital_dynamics_and_firm_structure | structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

These dinners are characterized by:
*   **Open-ended and No Agenda** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   **Wild Explorations** of unusual topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   **Collective Effervescence** among the group, something unattainable in one-on-one settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   **Constant Learning** and activating curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>

### The Role of the Dinner Table

A significant element of this tradition is the custom-designed table, crafted by Ole Lundberg based on an initial sketch and inspired by Jean-Marie Masoud's "The Seven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This table was specifically engineered to:
*   **Deconstruct Power Centers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
*   **Create a Non-Hierarchical Construct** with intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   **Prevent Sidebar Conversations** and ensure "one conversation" where everyone is tuned into the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

This design reflects the firm's ethos, ensuring that all partners are engaged in current discussions, whether the news is positive, negative, or challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Challenging Traditional Venture Capital Practices

The emphasis on open discussion and a "one conversation" environment stands in contrast to some [[traditional_investing_principles_in_venture_capital | traditional venture capital]] practices. For instance, some firms might encourage partners to have side conversations and pre-sell ideas before official meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. However, Benchmark's approach prioritizes direct, open discourse, with a rule against "pre-selling a deal" before a partner meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

The dinners frequently host esteemed outside guests, often individuals the firm has not yet partnered with or invested in, offering a spotlight of attention and the opportunity to learn from diverse perspectives, such as Dylan Field or Toby from Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This practice reinforces the firm's purpose of serving impactful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. While the custom table is not portable, these interactions have extended beyond the office, with dinners taking place in cities like Seattle and Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

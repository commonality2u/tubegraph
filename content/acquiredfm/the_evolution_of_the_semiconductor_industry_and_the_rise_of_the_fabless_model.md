From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

The [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | semiconductor industry]] has undergone a profound transformation, shifting from vertically integrated companies to a specialized ecosystem dominated by the "fabless" model and pure-play foundries. This evolution is epitomized by the rise of [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), a company that became foundational to the modern technological landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Genesis of the Fabless Model

Before the advent of specialized foundries, semiconductor companies typically handled both design and manufacturing internally, known as Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs). However, Morris Chang, founder of [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]], foresaw a shift towards a fabless model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>.

His early observations hinted at this future:
*   **Gordon Campbell's Vision** In his time at General Instrument, Chang met Gordon Campbell, who sought funding to start a new company. Campbell initially asked for $50 million, but later realized he only needed $5 million because he "wasn't going to build a fab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:16">[02:18:16]</a>. This moment was the beginning of Chang's understanding that fabless companies would emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:40">[02:18:40]</a>.
*   **ATM's Approach** Another company, ATM, had already started without any fabs and sought General Instrument to manufacture their wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:01">[02:19:01]</a>. This early situation highlighted both the difficulties (customers wanting the fab run their way) and advantages (serving many customers) of a foundry business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:15">[02:20:15]</a>.

## [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s Pure-Play Foundry Strategy

Chang's vision for [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] was to be a "dedicated Pure Play Foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:26">[02:22:26]</a>. This meant [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] would *not* compete with its customers by designing its own chips or end products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:56">[02:23:56]</a>. This strategy, though seemingly a limitation initially, proved to be a critical differentiator.

### The Learning Curve and Scale Economies
A fundamental principle underlying [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s success is the learning curve theory, refined by Chang during his time at Texas Instruments with Bruce Henderson and Bill Bane of Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:44">[02:37:44]</a>.

The core insight is that as production volume increases, the unit cost of manufacturing decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:11">[02:31:11]</a>. This drives a strategy of aggressive pricing and volume pursuit in early node generations to outcompete others, capture market share, and achieve the lowest costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:40">[02:38:40]</a>. The goal is to become the largest volume player to maximize fixed cost spread and gain significant [[scale economies in semiconductor industry | economies of scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:20">[02:38:20]</a>.

## Key Partnerships and Challenges

[[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s dedication to its pure-play model fostered deep trust with its customers, leading to crucial partnerships and navigating significant challenges.

### [[NVIDIA]]
[[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s relationship with [[NVIDIA]] began in 1997 with a letter from Jensen Huang, then CEO of a small, struggling [[NVIDIA]], requesting foundry services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Despite [[NVIDIA]]'s small size (around 50-60 employees) and financial difficulties, Morris Chang personally followed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Their first successful collaboration was on a "games chip" (likely the Riva 128, though Morris Chang could not recall the specific name) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This chip not only saved [[NVIDIA]] from bankruptcy but also led them to become one of [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s top five customers within two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

A major challenge arose around 2009 with [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s 40-nanometer node, which experienced manufacturing and quality problems, impacting customers like [[NVIDIA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Morris Chang, after returning as CEO, prioritized resolving this. He met with Jensen Huang, who expressed concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. Chang eventually offered [[NVIDIA]] a compensation package in the order of $100 million, which Huang accepted within 48 hours, preserving the critical partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>. This demonstrates the value of strong personal relationships and a commitment to customer trust in the [[semiconductor industry dynamics | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>.

### Apple
[[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s engagement with Apple began unexpectedly. Terry Gou, founder of Foxconn and a relative of Chang's wife, arranged a dinner meeting where Apple's COO, Jeff Williams, pitched [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] to manufacture their chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.

Apple wanted [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] to develop a 20-nanometer process, a "half-step" detour from [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s planned progression from 28-nanometer to 16-nanometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. This request was a significant capital expenditure, requiring billions of dollars in new investment, despite [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] having already invested heavily in 28-nanometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a>. [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] decided to borrow money and took on half of Apple's initial demand, a prudent financial decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>.

During this period, Intel, a traditional IDM, also approached Apple to be their chip manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>. However, Tim Cook informed Morris Chang that "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This reinforced Chang's belief that [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s pure-play model and superior customer trust differentiated it from Intel, which often alienated its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:02">[01:45:02]</a>.

The tradeoff of pursuing the 20-nanometer node for Apple was a delay in [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s 16-nanometer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>. This allowed Samsung to take the initial 16-nanometer orders from Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>. However, once [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s 16-nanometer process was ready, Apple shifted most of its requirements back to [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]], proving the strength of their relationship and [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:34">[01:54:34]</a>.

### [[Qualcomm]]
[[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] keenly sought [[comparison_of_qualcomm_and_the_global_semiconductor_industry | Qualcomm]] as a customer due to their reputation as a technology house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:08">[01:56:08]</a>. For years, [[comparison_of_qualcomm_and_the_global_semiconductor_industry | Qualcomm]] primarily used IBM as its foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:45">[01:57:45]</a>. However, in the late 1990s, [[comparison_of_qualcomm_and_the_global_semiconductor_industry | Qualcomm]] suddenly began giving [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] significantly more business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This signaled to Chang that IBM's semiconductor business was in trouble as they were losing a key client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a>.

IBM then approached [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] to co-develop the next technology generation (0.13 micron / 130 nanometer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:49">[01:59:49]</a>. [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] declined, understanding that co-development with a dominant partner like IBM would compromise their ability to develop their own processes independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:11">[02:00:11]</a>. IBM subsequently partnered with UMC, [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s competitor in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:45">[02:01:45]</a>.

## The Ecosystem of Semiconductor Manufacturing

The rise of the fabless model was also enabled by the development of a specialized ecosystem. Key players include:
*   **Architecture companies:** Like ARM, whose rise to dominance in mobile and beyond created a massive opportunity for dedicated foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:02">[02:25:02]</a>.
*   **Chip design software companies:** Such as Synopsis and Cadence, providing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:32">[02:28:32]</a>.
*   **Equipment vendors:** Like ASML, which supplies crucial manufacturing machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a>.

This specialized structure allowed companies to focus on their core competencies, whether it was chip design ([[NVIDIA]], Apple, [[comparison_of_qualcomm_and_the_global_semiconductor_industry | Qualcomm]]), architecture (ARM), or manufacturing ([[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]).

### Hsinchu Science Park
The physical manifestation of this ecosystem is exemplified by the Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan, where [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s headquarters and many fabs are located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This industrial park is home to not only [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] but also its partners, customers, and even two universities that supply PhDs directly into the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:08">[02:28:08]</a>. This concentration of talent and infrastructure creates an unparalleled environment for innovation and efficient communication within the [[semiconductor industry dynamics | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:33">[02:29:33]</a>.

## Conclusion: An Inevitable Dominance

The [[semiconductor industry dynamics | semiconductor industry]] has grown exponentially, from $26 billion in 1987 to $527 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. This immense growth, driven by an ever-increasing demand for computing power (often referred to as [[the future of semiconductor design and simulation | Moore's Law]]), has favored the emergence of dominant players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a>.

[[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s strategic decision to embrace the pure-play foundry model, invest heavily in R&D and capital expenditures ([[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing_and_technology_optimization | challenges in semiconductor manufacturing and technology optimization]]) at specific "sweet spots" like the 28-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>, and prioritize customer trust, allowed it to ride this [[semiconductor industry dynamics | industry dynamic]]. By absorbing orders, achieving massive economies of scale, and continually pushing technological boundaries, [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | TSMC]] transformed from an unlikely venture into an indispensable, trillion-dollar company at the forefront of global technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:10">[02:14:10]</a>. The [[technological_and_geopolitical_issues_facing_tsmc_and_the_semiconductor_industry | scale economies in semiconductor industry]] and constant demand for advancing technology suggest a natural monopoly characteristic in leading-edge manufacturing, where those in the lead tend to extend their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:03">[02:42:03]</a>.

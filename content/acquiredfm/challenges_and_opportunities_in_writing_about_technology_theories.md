Writing about evolving technology theories presents unique [[challenges_of_building_new_technologies | challenges]] and opportunities, especially when considering the format and timing of publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Book vs. Daily Articles

One significant decision for a writer is whether to compile theories into a canonical work like a book or to continue developing them through daily articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Challenges of Writing a Book
*   **Financial Disincentive** Daily writing can be significantly more lucrative than writing a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For instance, a subscription-based model can generate hundreds of times more revenue than selling a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Productivity and Deadlines** Daily deadlines can be a powerful spur for productivity, and the absence of such deadlines for a larger project like a book can be daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Risk of Obsolescence** A book is "frozen in time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Given the rapid evolution of technology and business models, theories can quickly become outdated or proven wrong. For example, a book on Aggregation Theory centered on Netflix written a few years ago might have been wrong about the balance between aggregation effects and the power of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Daily articles allow for corrections and revisions, openly addressing what was wrong and its implications for other platforms like Discovery Time Warner or Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Nature of the Internet** The internet is inherently transient, not permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This aligns with the dynamic nature of ongoing articles rather than a fixed book.

### Advantages of Daily Articles
*   **Flexibility and Iteration** Daily articles allow for continuous revision and refinement of theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This iterative approach is considered a better product than a static book, especially for evolving concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Immediate Correction** If a writer's analysis is incorrect, they have the medium and ability to address it immediately, explaining where they were wrong and what it means for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Engagement with Current Events** Writing about current events helps readers understand and spread insights, even if it means the article's specific context becomes less relevant over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This approach makes complex ideas more digestible for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## The Role of Timing and Branding

### Timing Insights
*   **Being Too Early** A writer can be "too early" with an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. An article written in 2014 about "economic power in the age of abundance," which was a better articulation of Aggregation Theory, was one of the least-read articles at the time because no one understood what was being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Communication Gap** It's crucial to meet the audience where they are in their understanding. If an audience is at "A," a writer cannot jump to "H" but must guide them through "B" and "C" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This applies to writing online, where there's a "right time and place for things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### The Power of Branding
*   **Coined Terminology** Giving a theory a concise and memorable name, like "Aggregation Theory," makes it "stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Without a strong brand, even well-articulated ideas may not resonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Building to a Point** Significant theories often emerge from a series of articles that build to a definitive concept. For Aggregation Theory, prior articles on Airbnb, Netflix, and websites culminated in a "short and sweet" piece that distilled previous insights and provided a name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Impact of Writing on Common Knowledge

Writers play a role in accelerating the understanding and acceptance of new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Ideas that were controversial a decade ago, such as Apple not being doomed, the internet centralizing rather than decentralizing, and Facebook's dominance, are now widely understood as accepted truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The "edge" a writer can provide in understanding these [[impact_of_data_accumulation_on_technology | dynamics]] is typically measured in months or a few years before it becomes common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

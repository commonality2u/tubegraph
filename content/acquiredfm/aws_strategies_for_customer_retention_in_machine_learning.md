AWS views machine learning (ML) as a significant pillar of its business, alongside compute and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While databases are acknowledged for their "stickiness" in customer retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, [[Amazons investment in machine learning | Amazon's investment in machine learning]] capabilities serves a similar strategic purpose for customer retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Key ML Offerings and Custom Services

AWS has actively expanded its ML offerings, including:
*   Introducing [[AWS machine learning services like SageMaker | SageMaker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Breaking out a custom ML keynote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Providing a range of cloud-hosted ML services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   Supporting frameworks like TensorFlow, originally created by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

AWS also offers its own container service (Amazon Container Service, ECS) and an Elastic Kubernetes Service. While they serve customers who desire Kubernetes, [[Amazon and AWS business strategy intentions | AWS aims to encourage customers to use their custom ECS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Data-Centric Retention Strategy

A core aspect of [[AWSs market position and strategy | AWS's strategy]] for machine learning customer retention revolves around the location of customer data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The fundamental principle is that customers will utilize whatever ML services are available where their data resides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Running machine learning models near the data is considered the most critical factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This creates a significant lock-in effect:
> "Once you've picked Amazon to be your storage vendor and you've sent semi trucks full of your data into their data centers, you're not shopping around for oh where should I run my ML, you're going to run your ML on AWS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

While AWS's ML capabilities need to be robust, they do not necessarily need to surpass competitors like Google, who are arguably better positioned in ML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This is because if a customer's data is stored with AWS, they are highly likely to use [[Importance of integrating machine learning with data storage | AWS's ML services]] regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, it's crucial for AWS not to fall significantly behind in its ML offerings to maintain this advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

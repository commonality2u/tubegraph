Michael Mauboussin, Head of Consilient Research at Counterpoint Global, a division of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, discusses the significance of [[Judgment and DecisionMaking in Investments | expectations investing]] and valuation, drawing from his extensive work and his role teaching security analysis at Columbia Business School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Counterpoint Global managed approximately $180 billion in assets as of mid-2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Expectations Investing

Mauboussin's professional epiphany came from reading Al Rappaport's 1986 book, *Creating Shareholder Value*, which completely changed his life's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Rappaport, whom Mauboussin considers one of the most important people in his life, laid three foundational principles:
1.  **Cash Flow, Not Earnings**: The ultimate driver of business value is cash flow, not accounting earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
2.  **Combine Strategy and Valuation**: Strategy and valuation should not be thought of as separate concepts; the litmus test of a strategy is whether it creates value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Understanding a business's competitive situation and market growth is crucial for proper valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
3.  **Stock Price Reflects Expectations**: A company's stock price reflects a set of expectations about its future financial performance, which executives should understand to meet and exceed those expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

These principles led Mauboussin and Rappaport to co-author *Expectations Investing*, first published on September 10, 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The book's seminal idea is a three-step process for investors:
1.  **Reverse Engineer Expectations**: Determine what you "have to believe" for a stock's current price to make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This is a more reasonable task than dictating value from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
2.  **Judge Expectations**: Use strategic and financial analysis to assess whether that set of expectations is too optimistic, too pessimistic, or about right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Most times, you won't have a differentiated view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
3.  **Take Action**: Buy, sell, or hold the stock based on your judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

This approach is highly [[Judgment and DecisionMaking in Investments | probabilistic]], considering multiple scenarios and understanding that a price reflects a distribution of potential outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## Valuation in a Modern Context

The nature of business assets has significantly changed. In 2001, capital expenditures (tangible investments) and intangible investments were roughly equal at $630-640 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. By 2021, intangible investments reached $2 trillion, while tangible capital expenditures were $1 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

*   **Intangibles**: Non-physical assets like software code, marketing, branding, R&D, and customer acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. These are often expensed on income statements, making traditional earnings less insightful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Cash Flow Focus**: This shift reinforces Rappaport's emphasis on cash flow over earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Companies can "lose money" on the income statement while making highly productive intangible investments that generate future value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   **Free Cash Flow**: The key metric is free cash flow (earnings minus investments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. It's desirable to invest as much as possible at a high return, even if it leads to negative free cash flow initially, similar to Walmart's early growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

Venture capitalists have inherently treated intangible investments as critical for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>, a mindset now being adopted by the broader investment community as "software is eating the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

## Competitive Strategy and Moats

Mauboussin's Columbia Business School course, which he has taught for 30 years, is structured into four parts: markets, valuation, [[The role of competitive moats in investment valuation | competitive strategy]], and [[Judgment and DecisionMaking in Investments | decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

Defining competitive advantage (a "moat") has two features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>:
1.  **Absolute**: Returns must be above the cost of capital (opportunity cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
2.  **Relative**: The company must perform better than its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

These are measured by metrics like return on invested capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. Competitive strategy analysis includes:
*   **Lay of the Land**: Understanding industry entry/exit, market share changes, and pricing flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Industry Dynamics**: Applying classic concepts like Michael Porter's Five Forces and Clay Christensen's disruptive innovation theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   **Source of Advantage**: Identifying whether the advantage stems from being a low-cost producer (low margins, high capital velocity – e.g., supermarkets, Amazon) or differentiation (high margins, low capital velocity – e.g., Tiffany's, Facebook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

Mauboussin emphasizes using checklists to ensure systematic thinking about all relevant issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

## Early-Stage Investing and Real Options

For early-stage companies, the future is highly uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. Mauboussin suggests thinking of these investments as [[future_uncertainties_in_investment_and_company_evaluation | real options]] rather than traditional bonds or stable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. [[Real options]] are valuable when there is:
*   **Volatility**: The more volatile the world, the more valuable the option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
*   **Strong Management**: Management's ability to identify and intelligently exercise options is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>, exemplified by Jeff Bezos at Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   **Access to Capital**: The ability to raise funds is essential to pay for and exercise options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. The dot-com bust, with limited capital access, prevented many good ideas from happening, unlike today's Instacart or Chewy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

Understanding industry entry and exit patterns is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. Stephen Klepper's work shows that industries typically see a huge upswing in competitors initially, followed by a significant consolidation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. The consolidation period can be a particularly interesting time to invest as fewer companies capture growing spoils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

The payoff distribution for venture deals is "super extreme" – the median venture deal earns nothing, and many lose money, but the tails are significant, resembling an option payoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. This contrasts with public markets, which show a more bell-shaped distribution of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

## Reflexivity

The concept of reflexivity, coined by George Soros, highlights the interaction between an observer and the observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. In markets, the act of bidding up a stock can fundamentally change the outlook for that company, often by enabling them to raise significant capital at favorable valuations, buying them time and runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>. Tesla's stock surge, for instance, allowed it to raise capital and strengthen its financial footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. This feedback loop can also work in reverse, leading to negative spirals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. While the phenomenon isn't new (e.g., conglomerate roll-ups), online tools and low transaction costs might make it easier for "meme stocks" to experience this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.

## Untangling Skill and Luck

Mauboussin's book, *The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing*, explores how both skill and luck contribute to outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.
*   **Skill**: The ability to apply knowledge readily in execution or performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.
*   **Luck**: Happens to an individual/organization, can be good or bad, and a different outcome could reasonably have occurred if events were replayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>.

The **Luck-Skill Continuum** places activities from all skill/no luck (e.g., chess, running races) to all luck/no skill (e.g., roulette, lotteries), with most activities falling in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.

The **Paradox of Skill** (inspired by Stephen J. Gould) states that in activities where both skill and luck contribute, as absolute skill increases, luck becomes more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. While absolute skill levels are higher than ever across sports, business, and investing, relative skill gaps have narrowed significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>. When competitors are equally highly skilled, outcomes can appear random, even though immense skill is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. This is why public market investing can appear random; it's not because markets are bad, but because they are "so good" and highly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

### Persistence of Performance and Regression to the Mean

Persistence of performance indicates skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. In public equity markets, there's very limited persistence; a good year doesn't predict another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. However, [[evaluating_judgment_in_venture_investment | venture capital]] still shows significant persistence, with the top 10-20% of funds consistently performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. Mauboussin's pet theory for this persistence in venture is **preferential attachment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>: top startups are more likely to seek out and get funding from leading venture firms, creating a reinforcing mechanism that compounds their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

**Regression toward the mean** is also tied to the luck-skill continuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>. On the all-skill side, there's no regression (e.g., Magnus Carlsen will always beat an amateur) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>. On the all-luck side, there's complete regression (e.g., winning the lottery doesn't increase your odds for the next day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>. The rate of regression reveals where an activity falls on the continuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.

## The Future of Investment Performance

Mauboussin believes that extraordinary streaks in investing, like Warren Buffett's 60-plus year track record, are a combination of skill and luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>. Given that the "luck" component is relatively stable, and "skill" has become more uniform (i.e., the paradox of skill has intensified), it will be very difficult for anyone to replicate or exceed such long-term, high returns, especially with the large amounts of capital involved today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. The standard deviation of excess returns (alpha) has "gotten skinnier and skinnier," indicating less opportunity for outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>.

### Seeking "Easy Games" in Investing

If starting a career in investing today, Mauboussin advises looking for "easy games" – [[Investment strategy and personality alignment | niches]] or geographies where you can be the "smartest person at the poker table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. This might involve:
*   **Geographical Focus**: Frontier or smaller emerging markets where diligence and "shoe leather" can provide an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>.
*   **Neglected Companies**: Focusing on public companies not followed by analysts or included in indexes/ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>.
*   **New Frontiers**: Areas like decentralized finance or crypto, despite their volatility, offer opportunities for fortunes to be made (and lost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.

Mauboussin also notes the impact of declining interest rates on [[Value Investing vs Growth Investing | market valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:37">[01:24:37]</a>. Low discount rates combined with rapid growth and high returns can substantially "crank value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:12">[01:25:12]</a>. While we've seen rapid increases in market cap (e.g., multiple trillion-dollar companies), future returns across all asset classes are expected to be "fairly muted" due to current risk-free rates and credit spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:55">[01:25:55]</a>.

Comparing the top 10 companies by market capitalization in 2001 and 2021 highlights dramatic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:55">[01:25:55]</a>:
*   Only Microsoft remained in the top 10 for both years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>.
*   Excluding Microsoft, the market capitalization of the other nine 2001 top companies decreased by $460 billion over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>.
*   Three of the top 10 companies in 2021 were not public in 2001, and two had not even been founded yet (e.g., Facebook, Tesla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>.

This extraordinary change suggests that [[the_future_prospects_of_the_global_economy_and_investing_opportunities | future leaderboards]] could also see substantial turnover, with new companies (some not yet founded or public) rising to prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. Healthcare, particularly with digital technology integration, is noted as an underrepresented sector that could produce future top companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a>.

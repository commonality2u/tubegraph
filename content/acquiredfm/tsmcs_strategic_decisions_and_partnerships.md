[[morris_chang_and_the_founding_of_tsmc | Morris Chang]], the 93-year-old founder of [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]], reflected on critical stories from the company's [[history_and_evolution_of_tsmc | history]] that shaped its [[impact_of_tsmc_on_the_semiconductor_industry | impact on the semiconductor industry]] and its partnerships with companies like Apple and Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. These reflections highlight key strategic decisions and the development of crucial relationships.

## Early Customer Acquisition and Pure-Play Strategy

[[morris_chang_and_the_founding_of_tsmc | Morris Chang]]'s relationship with Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, began in 1997 with a letter from Huang, whose company was small and facing bankruptcy but sought [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] as a foundry for promising chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. At the time, Nvidia had around 50-60 employees, while [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] had exceeded $1 billion in revenue in 1995 and had thousands of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Chang's curiosity and slight irritation at his sales team's unresponsiveness led him to personally contact Huang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Their first meeting impressed Chang with Huang's articulateness and optimism, despite Nvidia's financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Huang boldly predicted that the chip they wanted [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] to fabricate would save Nvidia and make it a major [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customer]] of [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This prediction proved true, with the successful gaming chip preventing Nvidia's bankruptcy and making them one of [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]]'s top five [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customers]] within two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

This partnership, where [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] manufactured and Nvidia designed, continued to grow, illustrating the power of the pure-play foundry model where [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] does not compete with its [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. Chang had anticipated the rise of "fabulous" companies—those that design chips but do not manufacture them—which became central to [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]]'s business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>.

## Addressing the 40nm Node Challenges

In 2009, during a period when [[morris_chang_and_the_founding_of_tsmc | Morris Chang]] had stepped back from the CEO role, [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] faced significant manufacturing and quality problems with its 40 nanometer node, particularly affecting major [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customers]] like Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. When Chang returned as CEO in 2009, resolving this issue was a top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. He personally called all major [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customers]], including Jensen Huang, who sternly reminded him of the quality and delivery problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Chang resolved the dispute with Nvidia by offering a financial settlement on the order of $100 million, based on extensive internal analysis of the problem and an understanding of Nvidia's pressures from their own [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. He presented the offer to Jensen Huang at his home, giving him 48 hours to accept before resorting to arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. Huang accepted, showcasing the strength of their personal relationship and partnership built over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

## Aggressive Investment in 28nm Technology

Following the resolution of the 40nm issues, [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] committed heavily to the 28 nanometer node, a decision that propelled them into a leadership position in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. Chang instituted a policy of dedicating 8% of revenue to R&D, regardless of economic conditions, a significant increase from previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. This consistent R&D investment provided stability and confidence to the research teams, who identified 28nm as a "sweet spot" in technology progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.

In 2010, [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] ramped up its capital expenditures from approximately $2.5 billion to nearly $6 billion, a threefold increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. This aggressive investment, which faced questions from the board, was driven by market forecasts and technical insights, with Chang believing it was [[the_role_and_influence_of_tsmc_in_global_technology_advancements | TSMC]]'s "tide" for fortune, referencing Shakespeare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. This strategic gamble coincided with the rise of the smartphone era, creating immense demand for the 28nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

## The Apple Partnership and the 20nm Detour

A crucial partnership began when Apple approached [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] for chip fabrication. Apple's Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Williams, visited [[morris_chang_and_the_founding_of_tsmc | Morris Chang]]'s home, indicating the significance of the engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. Williams proposed a 40% gross margin, which Chang internally noted was lower than [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]]'s existing 45% and his target of 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>.

The most unexpected request was for [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] to develop a 20 nanometer node, a "half step" detour from the planned progression to 16 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. This presented a dilemma as [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]]'s R&D capabilities at the time were not strong enough to develop two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. Despite the substantial investment already committed to 28nm without Apple in mind, [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] agreed to serve half of Apple's initial demand for 20nm chips, financing it through corporate bonds rather than cutting dividends or issuing new stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>.

### Competing with Intel and Samsung

In February 2011, Jeff Williams informed Chang that Intel's "highest level" had approached Tim Cook to consider Intel for iPhone chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>. Chang, however, was not overly concerned. He reasoned that while [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] was technologically on par with Intel at 28nm and better in manufacturing, Intel lacked "[[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customer]] trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. Tim Cook later confirmed this, stating that "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This meant Intel, accustomed to its dominant position, did not cater to [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customer]] requests as courteously as [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

The 20nm detour, however, delayed [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]]'s 16nm node development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>. This allowed Samsung, which did not undertake a 20nm development, to take initial 16nm orders from Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:06">[01:53:06]</a>. Chang felt "shocked" by this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:01">[01:52:01]</a>, but Jeff Williams reassured him that Apple would buy all their 16nm needs once [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>. Indeed, after [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]]'s 16nm node became available six months later, most of Apple's 16nm requirements still belonged to [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>.

## The Learning Curve and Market Dominance

[[morris_chang_and_the_founding_of_tsmc | Morris Chang]]'s understanding and refinement of the "learning curve theory" at Texas Instruments, in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Bill Bain, was fundamental to [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]]'s strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a>. The theory posits that as a company produces more of a product, its unit cost decreases, leading to greater efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:30">[02:03:30]</a>.

This implies that to become the largest volume player and achieve the lowest costs, a company should accelerate pricing in early stages, even at an initial unprofitability, to outcompete and gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. This strategic approach, combined with accurate market forecasting for future demand, allowed [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] to continuously invest in the next node and achieve economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:11">[02:39:11]</a>. The massive capital expenditures required to build Fabs (around $20 billion for a new one currently) and the R&D to create new processes contribute to a market where leaders continually extend their lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>.

## The Hsinchu Science Park Ecosystem

The physical concentration of [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] and its partners in the Hsinchu Science Park is a critical element of its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:45">[02:27:45]</a>. This government-sponsored industrial park hosts not just [[the_role_and_impact_of_tsmc_and_semiconductors | TSMC]] but also its partners, [[customer_loyalty_and_acquisition_at_tsmc | customers]] like Qualcomm and MediaTek, EDA companies like Synopsis and Cadence, and even universities that produce talent for the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:26">[02:28:26]</a>. This close geographic proximity facilitates incredibly close communication and integration, enabling the rapid development of new technologies and making it nearly impossible to replicate elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:33">[02:29:33]</a>.

## The Dawn of a New Era: IBM Enters the PC Market

In 1980, [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]], often referred to as the "Sun, Moon, and Stars" of the computing industry, decided to enter the burgeoning personal computer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>. This move marked a significant shift for the company, whose previous focus had been on massive, room-sized mainframe computers. [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] had previously missed the "mini computer" wave, which was championed by companies like Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), and now observed the rapidly expanding microcomputer market, which was "exploding" in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>.

Recognizing the need for a different approach to compete with agile startups, [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] initiated a secret project called "Project Chess" in Boca Raton, Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:07">[01:32:07]</a>. The goal was to develop the [[The development and impact of Windows 95 | IBM PC]], an [[Microsofts challenges and adaptations in the mobile and consumer technology sectors | IBM]] microcomputer, within just one year, utilizing entirely off-the-shelf components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>. Don Estridge, one of Project Chess's leaders, famously stated that to compete against companies "who started in a garage," [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] "have to start in a garage yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## The Search for Software: Microsoft's Opportunity

The hardware aspect of the [[The development and impact of Windows 95 | IBM PC]] was considered relatively straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a>. The crucial component would be the software, especially programming languages. By 1980, [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] had established itself as the world's leading provider of programming language interpreters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:11">[01:34:11]</a>. In the 8-bit computing era, operating systems were not considered as critical, often serving as glorified bootloaders to get into the programming environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>.

[[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] initially approached [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] for programming languages like BASIC, COBOL, and Fortran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>. When [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] also inquired about an operating system, [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Bill Gates]], acting in good faith, referred them to Digital Research, led by Gary Kildall, who had developed the CP/M operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:41">[01:39:41]</a>.

### Digital Research's Missed Opportunity

The meeting between [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]]'s Project Chess team and Digital Research in Monterey, California, became one of the biggest business blunders in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>. Accounts vary, but Gary Kildall either missed the meeting, possibly flying his personal airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>, or negotiations broke down over licensing terms, with Kildall reportedly demanding significant per-unit royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>. Regardless of the exact reason, [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] left believing Digital Research was not capable or willing to provide a customized 16-bit operating system for the [[The development and impact of Windows 95 | IBM PC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.

## Microsoft Acquires and Licenses DOS

With Digital Research out of the picture, [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] returned to [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]], throwing the problem back into their "lap" to source an operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:48">[01:42:48]</a>. [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] quickly found an opportunity with Seattle Computer Products (SCP), a local company in Tukwila, Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:29">[01:43:29]</a>. SCP's programmer, Tim Paterson, had developed a 16-bit operating system for the Intel 8086 chip, initially called "Quick and Dirty 16-bit Operating System" (QDOS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:50">[01:43:50]</a>. Paterson had written QDOS because Digital Research had failed to produce a 16-bit version of CP/M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>.

[[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] licensed QDOS from SCP for $25,000, with the right to adapt and sell it to one unnamed OEM (which was, of course, [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>. Tim Paterson himself later joined [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:39">[01:45:39]</a>. Before the [[The development and impact of Windows 95 | IBM PC]] shipped, [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] paid SCP an additional $50,000 for full rights to own 86-QDOS and license it indefinitely to anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>. This total acquisition cost of $75,000 for what would become MS-DOS is considered "unbelievable" given its future impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:07">[01:46:07]</a>.

### The Historic IBM-Microsoft Deal

In November 1980, [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] and [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] finalized their landmark partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>. [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] paid [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] a fixed fee of $430,000 for consultation, DOS, and 16-bit language interpreters, with no ongoing per-copy royalties for DOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

The crucial element of this deal, which turned out to be a "master stroke" for [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Bill Gates]], was that [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] **retained the rights** to own DOS and its languages and license them to anyone else they wanted, on any terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">[01:50:04]</a>. [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]], being concerned about [[Microsoft antitrust investigations and trials | antitrust scrutiny]] and believing they would dominate the PC market anyway, did not see the long-term implications of this decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:40">[01:51:40]</a>. [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] inadvertently commoditized their hardware by using off-the-shelf components, while granting [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] control over the software "lynchpin" of the emerging PC ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.

## The Launch of the IBM PC and the Rise of Clones

The [[The development and impact of Windows 95 | IBM PC]] launched in August 1981, just over a year after Project Chess began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:45">[01:54:45]</a>. It sold 13,500 units in the first few months and half a million over the next two years, becoming the market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>.

Consumers had a choice of operating systems for the [[The development and impact of Windows 95 | IBM PC]]. While CPM was offered for $175 and Pascal for $450, DOS (which [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] branded as PC DOS) was priced at a mere $60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a>. [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] ensured that DOS was the most attractive option, thereby maximizing their profit on the software layer since they didn't pay [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:48">[01:56:48]</a>.

However, [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]]'s off-the-shelf component strategy, coupled with [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]]'s retained licensing rights, led to the rapid rise of "clone" manufacturers. Companies like Compaq famously reverse-engineered [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]]'s proprietary BIOS, allowing them to create compatible PCs that were often cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>. Compaq became the fastest startup to hit $100 million and then $1 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:54">[01:59:54]</a>.

[[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]], free from any exclusivity with [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]], licensed DOS to all these clone manufacturers on a per-machine-sold basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:12">[02:01:12]</a>. This revenue model, where software had "zero marginal costs" and could be replicated infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:04">[03:35:04]</a>, created an "unbelievable" "geyser of money" for [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:50">[02:01:50]</a>. From 1982 to 1984, [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]]'s revenue quadrupled from $25 million to $98 million, primarily on the back of these clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:43">[02:02:43]</a>.

## Impact and Legacy

The partnership with [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] and the subsequent rise of MS-DOS proved to be the "single most important deal ever done in the history of technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>. It established [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] as the central, indispensable layer of the PC ecosystem, positioning them to capture immense value from the explosion of personal computing. This "positive spiral" of widespread adoption and developer support laid the foundation for [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]]'s future dominance in operating systems and applications.

This period was characterized by "unbelievable secular growth of the PC" with units shipped growing at a compound annual growth rate of 98% from 1975 to 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:12">[03:39:12]</a>. [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]]'s strategic foresight, combined with the unique economic conditions of the nascent software industry, allowed them to build a highly defensible business with minimal capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:50">[03:33:50]</a>. This success ultimately led to [[Bill Gates and the founding of Microsoft | Microsoft]] passing [[The business strategy and corporate structure of Microsoft | IBM]] in market capitalization in January 1993, inheriting the throne of computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:41">[02:55:41]</a>.

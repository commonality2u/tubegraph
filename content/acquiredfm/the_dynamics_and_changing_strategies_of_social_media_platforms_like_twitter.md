## Twitter's Current State and Historical Missteps

Twitter, once a prominent [[newsfeed_and_social_media_evolution | social network]], is no longer what it used to be, largely because users are now "scared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">00:05:12</a>. A significant factor contributing to this decline is the existence of a permanent archive of tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">00:05:03</a>.

### The Problem with Permanence

While people perceive Twitter as an "in the moment" product, they are then "stuck with this archive that induces fear [and] induces ruin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">00:04:57</a>. This fear reduces the "facade of what it's like to be on Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">00:05:10</a>.

### A Missed Opportunity: Disappearing Tweets

One of the biggest mistakes Twitter made, which was perhaps unforeseeable at the time, was not implementing disappearing tweets from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">00:04:45</a>. Had Twitter been conceived as an "in the moment" social network, it would likely be a "much better product" today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">00:04:55</a>. The suggestion is that this feature should still be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">00:04:56</a>. This suggests a potential [[strategies_for_creating_and_maintaining_power_in_platform_businesses | strategy]] for future development.

Jason Calacanis, a prominent figure in the tech and media landscape, embarked on a career marked by early entrepreneurial spirit, adaptability, and a keen eye for emerging trends. His formative years were shaped by financial challenges, which instilled a strong work ethic and a drive to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Early Life and Education
Calacanis grew up in Brooklyn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. A pivotal moment occurred in 1987 when his father's bar was seized by federal authorities due to unpaid taxes following the stock market crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This event, which happened six weeks before he was set to go to college, meant his father could no longer help with tuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

In response, Calacanis decided to attend Brooklyn College at night, taking a full course load of 16 credits across four evenings a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. During the day, he worked fixing laser printers, a "really good racket" at the time due to the recent release of HP's new printers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Early Tech Exposure and Entrepreneurial Ventures
Calacanis's fascination with technology began early, stemming from his exposure to video games and computers. His father purchased an Atari 2600 for him in 1976 or 1977, and even had one of the first Pong machines in his bar in Brooklyn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. He quickly realized the transformative potential of computers, believing they would "change everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

His earliest entrepreneurial endeavors included:
*   **VHF Jason's Hot Tapes**: His first technical business, involving the creation and sale of VHS tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Software Cracking**: A side job where he would copy and sell software like Chess Master for $10, and engage in "phone freaking" by soldering chips and adding memory to PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Transition to Media and Publishing
Calacanis consciously decided to pursue a career in media about technology rather than becoming a builder of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This decision was influenced by his exposure to zines (self-published magazines) in the West Village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. He created his own zine, *Cyber Surfer*, which focused on dial-up services and CD-ROMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This concept was "blogs before blogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Silicon Alley Reporter and Flatiron Partners
In the early 1990s, Calacanis met Jerry Colonna at the first Internet World conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Colonna, who was then a venture capitalist, invited Calacanis to read business plans for Acme Ventures, which later became [[success_stories_and_potential_pitfalls_for_yc | Flatiron Partners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Calacanis met Fred Wilson, another co-founder of Flatiron, and was paid $1,000 to read business plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. He famously wrote coverage recommending an investment in GeoCities, which became a major win for [[success_stories_and_potential_pitfalls_for_yc | Flatiron Partners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Fred Wilson became a deep mentor to Calacanis during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.

He launched *Silicon Alley Reporter*, focusing on the New York tech scene, and later *Digital Coast Reporter* in Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>. He expanded this business to include two magazines, two conferences, and two email newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. By age 27, he had grown the business to $10 million in revenue, self-funded through credit cards, and employed 75 to 100 people, despite having no prior experience in running a magazine or ad sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>. His growing prominence in the tech industry was highlighted by features in *The New York Times*, *Charlie Rose*, and *The New Yorker* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>.

### Sale of Weblogs Inc. to AOL
In 2005, Calacanis sold his company, Weblogs Inc., to AOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:59">[01:35:59]</a>. Weblogs Inc., which had only generated $200,000 in revenue to date, was acquired for $30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">[01:37:31]</a>. The deal was considered a significant win because AOL could monetize the content at a much higher rate due to their existing ad platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:10">[01:36:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:34">[01:36:34]</a>.

For Calacanis, this sale provided immense personal relief. Upon seeing the funds in his bank account, he became emotional, realizing that his family would "never have to worry about money again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:05">[02:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:04">[02:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:07">[02:16:07]</a>. This moment was particularly cathartic, given his past experiences with financial insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:12">[02:16:12]</a>.

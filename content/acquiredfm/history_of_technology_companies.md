## Research and Storytelling

For each episode, the hosts undertake extensive research, dedicating over 100 hours per episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21"></a>. This process involves reading all available literature on a company and watching relevant videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23"></a>. Their goal is to recount the entire story of these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29"></a>, aiming to provide "the absolute deepest longest and best technology stories on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42"></a>.

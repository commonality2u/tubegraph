Acquired is marking its 10-year anniversary with a major live event, [[acquired_live_show_at_radio_city_music_hall | Acquired Live at Radio City Music Hall]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This celebration follows a highly successful live show in San Francisco the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Acquired Live at Radio City Music Hall

The upcoming event, inspired by the success of the [[acquired_live_event_at_chase_center | Chase Center]] show, is set to take place on the evening of July 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Venue
The chosen venue is Radio City Music Hall in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, selected to feel "uniquely New York and authentic to the Acquired cannon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Radio City is known for hosting major events like the Tony Awards, Grammys, and MTV VMAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, and is also a significant part of Rockefeller Center, connecting to themes discussed in past Acquired episodes related to John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. It is the world's largest indoor theater, capable of seating 6,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Production Scale
The physical production of the show is described as "nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. For instance, the stage at Radio City will be three times wider than the one used at the [[acquired_live_event_at_chase_center | Chase Center]] event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Guest and Program
While the identity of the special guest for the event is being kept a surprise, listeners are promised "an evening of surprise and delight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The previous year's event at [[acquired_live_event_at_chase_center | Chase Center]] featured a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Tickets and Access
*   **Pre-sale access:** Available by signing up at acquired.fm/nyc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Pre-sale tickets will go live a few weeks before general public access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Pricing:** Tickets will be kept in a narrow price range, estimated to be around $100-$200, to make it accessible to as many people as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Seating:** Tickets will be for assigned seats, encouraging attendees to coordinate with friends, co-workers, or companies beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
*   **Demand:** Although Radio City seats 6,000, over 6,000 people attended the [[acquired_live_event_at_chase_center | Chase Center]] show, and the [[acquired_podcast_evolution_and_audience_growth | Acquired podcast and community engagement | listener base has grown]] since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Notably, New York City has a larger listener base for Acquired than the Bay Area, and this doesn't even account for the wider Northeast Corridor (Boston, DC, Philadelphia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Therefore, quick ticket sales are anticipated, and signing up for pre-sale is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

### Purpose and Financials
The event is explicitly not designed to be profit-generating for Acquired or its partner, JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. All revenue from tickets will be allocated towards production costs, including set design and the hundreds of crew members required to make the show happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. The primary goal is to celebrate Acquired and its listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

### Attendee Experience
Attendees can expect opportunities to mingle with other Acquired listeners, access special Acquired Radio City merchandise, and celebrate with fellow "business nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. JP Morgan is thanked for their partnership in putting on the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

Amazon's acquisition of Junglee is highlighted as one of the "craziest" acquisitions due to its story and subsequent unexpected outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Junglee was a comparison shopping site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, previously referenced in the Walmart episode of the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Junglee's Origins and Acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

Junglee was founded by three Stanford computer science PhDs and a business professional from Netscape named Ram Sriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. [[Amazons founding and early years | Amazon]] acquired Junglee for approximately $150 to $175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

At the time of acquisition, Junglee was based in Palo Alto, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, [[Amazons founding and early years | Amazon]] required the Junglee team to relocate to Seattle to avoid creating a tax nexus in California, a significant concern in those early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### The Unsuccessful Integration and Team Departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

The relocation proved problematic, with the Junglee team disliking their new environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The acquisition was ultimately "ill-conceived from the get-go" and "doesn't work out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Within a few months, the entire team quit and returned to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Post-Amazon Ventures and the Google Connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

Upon their return to Palo Alto, the former Junglee team went on to establish a new venture that was eventually acquired by Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This acquisition led to the formation of Walmart Labs, which is now considered the second-biggest factor contributing to Walmart's strong competitive position in e-commerce, only behind Jet and Marc Lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Ram Sriram, the business professional from Netscape who was part of Junglee, later connected with two other Stanford computer science PhDs, Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Having made money from the Junglee acquisition, Sriram became the first investor in Google, injecting $250,000 and joining the company's board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Six months later, [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration | Jeff Bezos]], still on friendly terms with Sriram despite the failed Junglee integration, learned about Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration | Bezos]], accompanied by MacKenzie Scott, visited Sriram in Silicon Valley to meet Page and Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Despite the initial seed round being closed, [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration | Bezos]] insisted on investing on the same terms as Sriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Sriram advocated for [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration | Bezos]], convincing Page and Brin to accept another $250,000 from [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration | Jeff]] and MacKenzie's personal funds at the seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The subsequent Series A funding round for Google famously valued the company at $100 million post-money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. It is estimated that [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration | Jeff]] and MacKenzie owned at least one percent of Google personally, even after dilution from the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Google went public solely based on that Series A funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

At its IPO in 2004, Google had a market cap of $23 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, making [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration | Bezos]]'s shares worth approximately $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Since then, Google's value has multiplied by 65 times over the following 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration | Bezos]] has never publicly commented on whether he and MacKenzie sold their Google shares, he likely held them at least until the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This significant personal investment provided [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration | Bezos]] with substantial capital for other ventures like Blue Origin and personal investments in funds like Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

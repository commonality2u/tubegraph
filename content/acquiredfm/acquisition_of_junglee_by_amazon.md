The acquisition of Junglee by Amazon stands out due to its unusual story and significant unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Junglee, a comparison shopping site, was founded by three Stanford computer science PhDs and a business professional from Netscape named Ram Sriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Acquisition and Its Failure

Amazon acquired Junglee for approximately $150-$175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. At the time, Junglee was based in Palo Alto, but Amazon required the team to relocate to Seattle to avoid creating a tax nexus in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Despite the financial incentive, the Junglee team disliked Seattle, and the acquisition was deemed ill-conceived from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Within a few months, the entire team quit and moved back to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Junglee Team's Subsequent Impact

After leaving Amazon, the Junglee team went on to start the company that would eventually be acquired by Walmart, becoming Walmart Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Walmart Labs grew to be a major factor in Walmart's success as an e-commerce competitor, second only to Jet and Mark Lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Ram Sriram's Connection to Google

Back in Palo Alto, Ram Sriram, the business guy from Netscape, connected with two other Stanford computer science PhDs: Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Leveraging the money he made from the Junglee acquisition, Sriram became an early investor in Google. He invested the first $250,000 in Google and joined its board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This occurred before Google was founded, while Amazon was already a public company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## [[jeff_bezos_early_investment_in_google | Jeff Bezos's Early Investment in Google]]

Approximately six months after Sriram's initial investment, Jeff Bezos, who maintained a friendly relationship with Sriram despite the failed Junglee acquisition, learned about Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Bezos called Sriram, expressing interest in meeting Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Bezos and his then-wife, MacKenzie, flew to Silicon Valley and had breakfast at Sriram's house with Page and Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. After the meeting, Bezos expressed his desire to invest in Google on the same terms as Sriram, even though the seed round had closed months prior and major venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital were already circling for a Series A round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Sriram advocated for Bezos, convincing Page and Brin to accept another $250,000 personal investment from Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos at the seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The subsequent Series A round for Google was famously split between John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and Mike Moritz of Sequoia, valuing Google at an "insane" $100 million post-money valuation for the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It is estimated that Ram Sriram's initial investment was at a valuation significantly lower, possibly around $10 million post-money, resulting in a 10x-20x gain from the Series A alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

It is likely that Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos personally owned at least one percent of Google, even after dilution from the Series A, as Google went public solely on that Series A round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Google's IPO in 2004 had a market cap of $23 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. At that time, their shares would have been worth approximately $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Bezos has never publicly commented on whether he and MacKenzie sold their Google shares, but they would have held them until at least the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Since the IPO, Google's value has increased by 65x over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This significant personal capital allowed Bezos to fund other ventures, such as rocket companies and venture funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

The initial acquisition of Junglee by Amazon, while a failure for Amazon's direct purposes, inadvertently led to [[jeff_bezos_early_investment_in_google | Jeff Bezos's early investment in Google]] through maintained relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This highlights the long-term, interconnected nature of the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Bezos's personal wealth was significantly boosted by this Google investment, providing him with ample capital independent of his Amazon shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

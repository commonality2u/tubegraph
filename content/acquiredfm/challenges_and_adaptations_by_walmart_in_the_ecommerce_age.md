Walmart, the world's largest company by revenue, has faced significant challenges and undergone adaptations in the era of [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]]. While historically dominant in brick-and-mortar retail, its digital journey has been a work in progress, particularly in competition with [[Amazons_business_strategies_and_innovations | Amazon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>.

## Initial Slow Adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>
Walmart was slow to adapt to the internet, not taking it seriously at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:26">[02:02:26]</a>. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, they did not perceive [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] as an existential threat to their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:33">[02:02:33]</a>. This contrasts with their historical DNA of identifying and pursuing opportunities, such as the Supercenter concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:57">[02:02:57]</a>. The company did not have a compelling enough case made internally for a massive investment in an internet team until it was "kind of too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:09">[02:03:09]</a>.

## Acquisitions to Bolster E-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:27">[02:03:27]</a>
To address its late start in [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]], Walmart made several strategic acquisitions to build out its digital capabilities and talent:
*   **Kosmix (2011)**: Walmart acquired Kosmix for $300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:36">[02:03:36]</a>. This acquisition led to the formation of Walmart Labs, initially run as a separate entity and later merged into Walmart's Global Internet division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:17">[02:04:17]</a>. This marked a turning point where Walmart began to take [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:22">[02:04:22]</a>.
*   **Bonobos**: Walmart also acquired Bonobos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:29">[02:04:29]</a>.
*   **Jet.com (2016)**: The company acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:45">[02:04:45]</a>. Although the Jet.com platform itself was eventually shut down, the acquisition's purpose was to bring in "a bunch of really talented [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] focused engineers and product people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:39">[02:05:39]</a>. Mark Lore, who founded Jet.com, is credited by Walmart's current CEO Doug McMillon with jumpstarting their [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:59">[02:05:59]</a>. Lore left Walmart in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:53">[02:05:53]</a>.

## Leveraging Physical Infrastructure for E-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:40">[02:06:40]</a>
Walmart's [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] strategy leverages its vast network of physical stores and [[Walmarts_logistics_and_operational_strategies | distribution centers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:44">[02:06:44]</a>. The goal is to create a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:56">[02:06:56]</a>. This includes:
*   **Same-day grocery delivery** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:02">[02:07:02]</a>.
*   **In-store pickup** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:04">[02:07:04]</a>.
*   **Flexible purchasing**: Customers can buy online and pick up in-store, or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:06">[02:07:06]</a>.
*   **Scan & Go (Walmart+ feature)**: Walmart+ allows customers to shop with their phone in the store, scanning and checking out as they go, then walking out seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:12">[02:08:12]</a>.

This strategy aims to counteract [[Amazons_business_strategies_and_innovations | Amazon]]'s approach of building physical infrastructure from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:19">[02:07:19]</a>. Walmart has also been converting former Sam's Clubs into [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] [[Walmarts_logistics_and_operational_strategies | distribution centers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:50">[02:36:50]</a>.

## E-commerce Performance and Comparison with Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:50">[02:05:50]</a>
Walmart's [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] business has made a good comeback, growing at 37% pre-pandemic in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:11">[02:06:11]</a>. However, it still accounts for only about 13% of Walmart's total revenue, which is around $75 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:25">[02:06:25]</a>. While Walmart's [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] is growing faster than [[Amazons_business_strategies_and_innovations | Amazon]]'s, [[Amazons_business_strategies_and_innovations | Amazon]]'s [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] business is five to six times larger in scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:38">[02:06:38]</a>.

### Digital Experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>
From a consumer perspective, Walmart's online experience is "pretty identical" to [[Amazons_business_strategies_and_innovations | Amazon]]'s, though selection may not be as large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:13">[02:09:13]</a>. However, technologically, [[Amazons_business_strategies_and_innovations | Amazon]] is more advanced, particularly in its search algorithm, which incorporates metadata, keywords, and user-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:02">[02:10:02]</a>. Walmart's search primarily relies on title and product description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a>.

### Profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:55">[02:35:55]</a>
Despite its growth, [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] is not yet a profitable segment for Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:58">[02:35:58]</a>. This is partly due to the massive fixed costs associated with the employee base and potentially aggressive pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:08">[02:36:08]</a>.

## International E-commerce Challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:16">[02:21:16]</a>
Walmart's international ventures have been mixed. While successful in Mexico and Canada, they have experienced big losses in Europe, pulling out of Germany and selling their Asda chain in the UK at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:13">[02:23:13]</a>.

Their largest international [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] investment is Flipkart in India, where Walmart bought a 77% stake for over $16 billion in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:32">[02:23:32]</a>. This acquisition was intended as a "vector to bring Walmart into India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:57">[02:23:57]</a>. However, its performance has been questionable, with only 20 to 30 Walmart-owned physical locations in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:07">[02:24:07]</a>.

## Overall Impact on Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:21">[02:24:21]</a>
Walmart's overall revenue growth rate has steadily declined since 1982, when it grew at 40-50% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:30">[02:24:30]</a>. By 2013, it had plateaued at around 3% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:39">[02:24:39]</a>. This slower growth, despite being the world's largest company by top-line revenue, indicates the challenges of maintaining momentum in a rapidly changing retail landscape where [[impact_of_ecommerce_on_retail | e-commerce]] and other competitors like Costco and dollar stores are significant factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>.

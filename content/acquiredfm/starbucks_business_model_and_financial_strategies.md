## Early Business Model: From Beans to Beverages
Starbucks, originally founded by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegel, and Gordon Bowker in 1971, initially operated as a small chain of three stores in Seattle, selling only pounds of roasted coffee beans, not prepared beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:16">[08:11:16]</a>. The company started using Peet's Coffee due to the founders' admiration for Alfred Peet, a pioneer in specialty coffee in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

In 1982, [[Howard Schultzs Role and Leadership at Starbucks | Howard Schultz]] joined Starbucks as the head of marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. His "epiphany" came during a 1983 trip to Milan, Italy, where he was captivated by the thriving coffee bar culture and the sense of community it fostered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. He envisioned Starbucks expanding into the prepared beverage business, a concept initially resisted by the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>. After two years of persistence, he was allowed to open a small coffee bar section within the sixth Starbucks store in Seattle, which quickly saw sales soar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.

This early venture revealed a potent business model:
*   **High Gross Margin** The ability to source and roast coffee internally, then sell it as a prepared beverage, provided an approximate 80% gross margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the typical restaurant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:00">[41:51:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Frequency** The business thrived on high customer frequency, with the most loyal customers visiting 18 times a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Payback** New stores could cover their costs and become profitable within two years, and often as quickly as a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:21:00">[43:21:00]</a>. The financial model presented to Wall Street during the IPO in 1992 showed a sales-to-investment ratio of 2:1 and an operating profit of over 20% in the first year of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>. This was considered unprecedented in the retail world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:17:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Customization** Early on, customers began to customize their beverages, which not only increased customer loyalty but also raised the average ticket price, enhancing margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:28:00">[44:28:00]</a>. Starbucks now handles an estimated 100,000 different beverage variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:19:00">[44:19:00]</a>.

## Financial Foundations and Growth Strategies
After purchasing the original Starbucks in 1987 for $3.8 million, [[Howard Schultzs Role and Leadership at Starbucks | Howard Schultz]] was determined to avoid the financial troubles that led the previous owners to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>. His childhood experience with parental debt instilled a strong "no debt" philosophy for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>.

### People-First Approach
A cornerstone of the [[Starbucks Approach to Branding Culture and Innovation | Starbucks Approach to Branding Culture and Innovation]] was a deep commitment to its employees, referred to as "partners." This was driven by [[Howard Schultzs Role and Leadership at Starbucks | Howard Schultz]]'s desire to build a "different kind of company" based on respect and dignity, contrasting with his father's experiences of being disrespected in blue-collar jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

Key initiatives included:
*   **Bean Stock (1991)**: Before the IPO, Starbucks offered equity in the form of stock options to every employee, including part-time workers (working 20+ hours a week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>. This program transformed the company's culture, leading to enhanced performance and lower attrition rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. Initial grants at $6 per share became 800 times more valuable due to stock splits and price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Healthcare (1988)**: Starbucks began offering health benefits to part-time employees, including gay couples in domestic partnerships, a pioneering move years before the Affordable Care Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **College Achievement Plan (2014)**: Partnering with Arizona State University, Starbucks offered 4-year free college tuition to all partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:41">[02:52:41]</a>. Thousands of partners have since engaged or graduated from the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

This investment in people significantly reduced employee turnover, which is twice as long as the industry average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:19">[02:52:19]</a>. This retention strategy effectively lowered training costs and fostered a more experienced and loyal workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. The strategy was influenced by [[Costcos business model and evolution | Costco]]'s success in valuing employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>.

### Guerrilla Marketing and Brand Building
Starbucks famously spent "zero" dollars on traditional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. Instead, brand awareness was built through:
*   **The "Third Place" Concept**: Creating community hubs between home and work, fulfilling a societal need for human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **The Iconic Cup**: The distinct Starbucks cup became a "badge of honor" and a "free billboard," generating word-of-mouth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>.
*   **Strategic Partnerships**:
    *   **[[Costcos business model and evolution | Costco]]**: Selling Starbucks beans in [[Costcos business model and evolution | Costco]] warehouses significantly increased store traffic and beverage sales in nearby Starbucks locations, demonstrating a direct correlation between selling beans and driving beverage customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>.
    *   **United Airlines**: Becoming the official coffee served on United Airlines provided wide exposure and "surprised and delighted customers" with quality coffee in unexpected places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.
    *   **Grocery Stores**: Distributing Starbucks coffee products in grocery stores expanded reach into new channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.
    *   **Barnes & Noble**: Opening Starbucks cafes inside Barnes & Noble bookstores was seen as a "natural extension" of the "third place" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>.

### Real Estate Strategy
Starbucks' real estate strategy focused on finding corner locations in urban settings with high pedestrian traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:23">[02:11:23]</a>. They also sought co-tenancies with grocery stores and targeted office buildings with large populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:05">[02:12:05]</a>. This strategic placement ensured high visibility and convenience.

### IPO and Expansion
Starbucks went public in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>, valuing the company at $250 million with shares at $17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. Goldman Sachs initially rejected underwriting the IPO, considering Starbucks "too small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. At the time of IPO, Starbucks had 130 stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>.

The expansion strategy was cautious but aggressive, growing from 6 stores in 1987 to 26 in one year, and over 100 in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. New markets were entered methodically, ensuring success in existing markets before compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. For example, Chicago was the first market outside Seattle and Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. The decision to enter Los Angeles, despite internal resistance, proved successful due to brand equity and visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

### International Expansion Model
Starbucks adopted a joint venture (JV) or licensed partner model for international expansion, especially in non-English speaking markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>. This ensured partners understood local culture and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:18">[02:29:18]</a>. Starbucks provided roasted coffee, recipes, and store co-design, while partners managed operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:31">[02:29:31]</a>.

Key international markets include:
*   **Japan (1996)**: Despite a consultant's report recommending against it, Starbucks entered Japan with a local partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. It became an "extraordinary success" from day one, with the cup quickly becoming ubiquitous, turning the country into an icon in nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>.
*   **China (1999)**: Starbucks initially struggled in China for a decade, experiencing losses and partner issues due to cultural misunderstandings (e.g., trying to sell blueberry muffins in a tea-drinking culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:48">[01:38:48]</a>. The turnaround was attributed to Belinda Wang, who decentralized control and tailored the business to local preferences, including providing health insurance to parents and grandparents of partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>. China now accounts for 18% of Starbucks' revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a>.

## Challenges and Turnaround (2008-2010)
After stepping down as CEO in 2000, [[Howard Schultzs Role and Leadership at Starbucks | Howard Schultz]] returned in 2008 amidst a "cataclysmic financial crisis" and internal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>. The market cap had plummeted from $30 billion to less than $7 billion, and the company was seven months from insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:50">[01:43:50]</a>.

Key actions during the turnaround included:
*   **Store Closures**: Identifying and closing approximately 1,000 underperforming stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Re-focus on Core Values**: Addressing partners directly, admitting mistakes, and emphasizing the "humanity and the people of the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Quality Restoration**: Halting practices that diluted coffee quality for maximizing yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>.
*   **Rallying Employees**: Holding a company-wide meeting in New Orleans, combining community service with a direct address to 10,000 store managers, providing a tangible goal for turning around performance at the store level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

This turnaround was wildly successful, with profits rising from $315 million in 2008 to $945 million by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:33">[01:55:33]</a>.

## Modern Business Dynamics
As of 2024, Starbucks generates $36 billion in revenue and $4.1 billion in net income, operating 39,000 stores globally in 86 countries, with 450,000 employees and having employed over 5 million people in its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:26">[02:26:26]</a>.

### [[Platform Business Models | Digital Innovation]] and Challenges
Starbucks introduced a mobile app with "Mobile Order & Pay" around 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:10">[01:59:10]</a>. Today, 33% of Starbucks orders are placed via this app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:14">[01:58:14]</a>.

This digital innovation brought several financial benefits:
*   **Float**: Starbucks holds approximately $1.8 billion in unspent customer funds loaded onto gift cards, essentially an interest-free loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:37">[02:03:37]</a>. Annually, $24 billion is loaded onto gift cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:22">[02:04:22]</a>.
*   **Reduced Transaction Costs**: Customers buying gift cards reduce [[Visas business model and structure | Visa]] transaction fees on individual coffee purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:56">[02:07:56]</a>.
*   **Efficiency and Convenience**: The app offers unparalleled convenience for customers and streamlines operations.

However, it also created significant challenges:
*   **Degradation of "Third Place" Experience**: The convenience of mobile order and pay led to a decline in the in-store "third place" experience, as baristas became overwhelmed and customer interactions were depersonalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:53">[02:00:53]</a>.
*   **Operational Strain**: The high volume of mobile orders created congestion and long wait times in stores, leading to customer dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:23">[02:01:23]</a>.

[[Howard Schultzs Role and Leadership at Starbucks | Howard Schultz]] believes the company did not adequately anticipate or adapt to the technological refinements needed to avoid these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:06">[02:02:06]</a>, suggesting that the mobile app's 24/7 on-demand availability should have been "slow rolled" to prevent disruption of the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:39">[02:06:39]</a>.

### Recent Challenges and Future Outlook
In early 2022, [[Howard Schultzs Role and Leadership at Starbucks | Howard Schultz]] returned as interim CEO, suspending stock buybacks to reinvest over $2 billion into partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:54">[03:07:54]</a>. He noted a "lack of investment" over the preceding four to five years and expressed concern that the company was drifting towards "mediocrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:34">[03:11:34]</a>. His recommendations included a return to being a "coffee company serving people" rather than a "beverage company serving coffee," emphasizing being "coffee forward" and preventing the mobile app from being a "runaway train" that dilutes the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:26">[03:12:26]</a>.

Despite current challenges, Starbucks remains a resilient institution that has created an industry and millions of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:51">[02:53:51]</a>. Its success is attributed to its commitment to humanity, quality, and an experiential brand that has expanded the overall coffee market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:55">[02:38:55]</a>.

> "The worst thing that a company can do like a sports team is start playing defense because you're afraid to fail... The worst thing that could happen to a company is believing that you are incapable of doing anything but succeeding and you deserve the success." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>

## Complexity of the Starbucks Business Model
The company's business model is exceptionally complex, encompassing multiple industries:
*   **Agricultural Buyer**: Sourcing coffee from 30 producing countries, subject to weather and political issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:15">[03:02:15]</a>.
*   **Manufacturer**: Roasting and blending coffee with proprietary taste profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:39">[03:02:39]</a>.
*   **Retailer**: Operating 39,000 stores globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:10">[03:03:10]</a>.
*   **Wholesaler**: Distributing products through channels like grocery stores and [[Costcos business model and evolution | Costco]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:13">[03:03:13]</a>.
*   **Joint Venture Manager**: Overseeing relationships with partners in 80 countries, including large companies like PepsiCo and Nestle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:16">[03:03:16]</a>.
*   **People Business**: Managing the motivation and opportunities for nearly 500,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:26">[03:03:26]</a>.
*   **Quasi-Financial Institution**: Managing $1.8 billion in customer gift card balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>.

The [[acquired_podcast_format_and_content_strategy | Acquired]] podcast hosts, Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, provide a rare glimpse into the operations, growth, and strategic decisions behind their successful show, especially during a summer hiatus.

## Summer Hiatus and Live Show Preparation
After nearly a decade of continuous podcast production, the [[acquired_podcast_format_and_content_strategy | Acquired]] team took a six-week summer break from making episodes to focus their energy on a major live event [00:00:26]. This energy was channeled into preparing for a live show on September 10th at the Chase Center in San Francisco [00:00:40]. This event is touted as the biggest undertaking the podcast has ever attempted, taking place at the arena where the Golden State Warriors play [00:00:57].

The live show is a partnership with [[collaboration_with_jp_morgan_payments_and_acquired_podcast | JP Morgan Payments]], whose team has significantly augmented the [[acquired_podcast_format_and_content_strategy | Acquired]] team's efforts [00:00:49, 00:02:57]. Mark Zuckerberg is confirmed to be a guest, with other surprises planned [00:01:06, 00:01:20]. Tickets were priced affordably at $100 for floor seats (nearly sold out) and $50 for all other arena seats, making it the cheapest ticketed event ever at the Chase Center, despite a high production budget [00:02:46, 00:03:00]. The goal for the event is to create a large celebration and community gathering, akin to the "Omaha for Tech" or "Omaha on the west coast" [00:01:53, 00:02:00]. Listeners are encouraged to organize their own meetups around the show [00:02:07, 00:02:35]. Group ticket purchases can be arranged by emailing hello@acquired.fm [00:10:45].

## Unprecedented Growth and Impact
The podcast experienced a "hell of a ride" in recent months, marked by a Wall Street Journal article profiling the show [00:03:34, 00:03:49]. This article, published around late April/early May, is considered the best encapsulation of what [[acquired_podcast_format_and_content_strategy | Acquired]] is [00:04:09]. Previously, a Fast Company piece by David Lky focused on the making of an episode [00:04:16].

Following the Wall Street Journal piece, [[growth_and_success_of_acquired_podcast | Acquired]] became the number one podcast on both Spotify and Apple charts globally [00:04:35]. This sustained top ranking led to significant amplification of its reach [00:05:08]. The podcast gained 317,000 new subscribers or followers after the article went live [00:05:31]. For context, the estimated listener base at the beginning of the year was about 500,000 people [00:05:46].

The hosts reflected on this growth, noting that while they usually advise against relying on single press articles for trajectory change, this instance was an exception, a "lightning in a bottle moment" [00:06:01, 00:06:23]. The podcast had grown organically for nearly a decade, doubling its audience year over year, primarily through personal recommendations [00:06:37, 00:06:50]. The Wall Street Journal article brought in the "exact right audience" of well-educated, thoughtful business people who enjoy deep dives into industry topics [00:07:37, 00:07:42]. This also disproved the hosts' previous belief that people wouldn't discover podcasts through reading about them in another medium [00:08:12, 00:08:28].

A core takeaway from the companies [[acquired_podcast_format_and_content_strategy | Acquired]] covers is that "every great success story is idiosyncratic" and cannot be planned [00:09:26]. This notion, that "you can't plan this," applies to their own unexpected surge in popularity [00:09:50, 00:10:00].

## Evolving Show Structure: The Role of AQ2
The unique aspect of [[acquired_podcast_format_and_content_strategy | Acquired]] episodes is the in-depth research and discussion format between Ben and David, where they analyze business histories and strategies over four-hour sessions [00:11:34, 00:11:45]. This differs from traditional interview shows [00:11:54].

While they occasionally interview protagonists of businesses they've covered (e.g., Jensen, Charlie, Dara, Howard Schultz), the main [[acquired_podcast_format_and_content_strategy | Acquired]] show will primarily stick to the core two-person format [00:12:09, 00:12:27]. This decision led to the expansion of AQ2, a separate platform for conducting interviews [00:12:43, 00:12:48]. AQ2 features deep dives with industry figures like the Synopsys founder and CEO on the state of semiconductors, and upcoming interviews with individuals like Joe Montana, who transitioned from an NFL quarterback to a venture capitalist and investor [00:12:55, 00:13:03, 00:13:10].

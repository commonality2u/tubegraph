Acquired Live is set to take place at the iconic [[Significance of Radio City Music Hall venue | Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City on the evening of July 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This event aims to be both uniquely New York and authentic to the Acquired "cannon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## A Follow-Up to the Chase Center Event

This New York City show follows the successful live event held last year in San Francisco at the [[Acquired's Chase Center event details | Chase Center Arena]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. That event featured a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg and was supported by [[Partnership with JP Morgan for Acquired Live | JP Morgan Payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The previous live show was described as "incredible" and a "life experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. After the positive reception of the San Francisco event, the decision was made to bring Acquired Live to New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## The Significance of Radio City Music Hall

[[Significance of Radio City Music Hall venue | Radio City Music Hall]] is an iconic New York City theater, known for hosting the Rockettes, Tony Awards, Grammys, MTV VMAs, and the NFL draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It is also a significant part of Rockefeller Center, connecting to the physical legacy of Standard Oil and John D. Rockefeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The venue is the world's largest indoor theater, with a seating capacity of 6,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Event Details and Production

[[Event planning and production for Acquired Live | The physical production of the show]] is described as "nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. As an example, the stage at Radio City Music Hall will be three times the width of the one used at the [[Behind the scenes of Acquired Live at Chase Center | Chase Center]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. While the specific guest for the event is being kept under wraps, attendees are promised an "evening of surprise and delight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The event will also coincide with Acquired's 10-year anniversary, adding to the celebration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Ticketing and Accessibility

[[Presale and ticketing information for Acquired Live | Presale access]] for tickets is available by signing up at acquire.fm/nyc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Tickets will be assigned seats, and attendees are encouraged to coordinate with friends and co-workers in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Despite Radio City Music Hall's 6,000-person capacity, the previous Chase Center show had over 6,000 attendees, and the podcast's listener base has grown, with New York City having a larger listener base than the Bay Area, not including the rest of the Northeast Corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Therefore, signing up for the presale is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Tickets will be priced within a narrow range, approximately $100-120, to ensure accessibility for as many people as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The event is not intended for profit by Acquired or [[Partnership with JP Morgan for Acquired Live | JP Morgan]]; all ticket revenue will cover production costs such as set design and the hundreds of crew members involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Community Engagement

The event will offer opportunities for attendees to mingle with other Acquired listeners, access special Acquired Radio City merchandise, and celebrate with fellow "business nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Current Challenges
The primary challenge for [[growth_and_impact_of_aws_on_amazons_business | AWS]] is the drying up of startup formation and the availability of "easy money" in that space, which traditionally flowed into AWS as the default choice for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:22">[09:30:22]</a>.

## Competitive Landscape
[[competitive_landscape_of_cloud_services_aws_vs_microsoft_azure_vs_google_cloud | Microsoft's]] Azure has adopted a smart strategy by leveraging its existing relationships with enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Microsoft offers to package its services, bundling Azure credits with existing on-premise Windows payments, and assists companies in migrating parts of their operations to the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:20">[09:41:20]</a>. This approach allows Microsoft to "clean up" in the market by being the known entity that can facilitate transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

## AWS's Moat and Strategy
[[awss_approach_to_cloud_computing_and_technology_strategy | AWS]] benefits significantly from its vast number of features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:54">[10:27:54]</a>. Despite having an interface that is "pretty terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:27">[10:39:27]</a>, AWS is compared to Microsoft Word: every customer depends on at least one specific feature, creating a strong lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

A core aspect of [[awss_business_model_and_financial_impact | AWS's]] strategy, distinguishing it from other parts of [[Amazons business strategies and innovations | Amazon]], is its refusal to deprecate features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:53">[10:58:53]</a>. While Amazon's retail side might discontinue products like the Fire Phone or local food delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:46">[11:00:46]</a>, [[amazon_web_services_aws_history_and_origin_stories | AWS]] commits to supporting services indefinitely if a customer relies on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:34">[11:07:34]</a>. This commitment is crucial for its long-term enterprise value, as it ensures customer trust and allows customers to believe AWS will "continue to support them forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:51">[11:11:51]</a>. This policy can lead to [[awss_business_model_and_financial_impact | AWS]] maintaining costly services that are not optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:07">[11:19:07]</a>, but it creates significant customer lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:26">[11:30:26]</a>. Attempts at "Cloud agnostic" solutions often fail because specific, niche services offered by a cloud provider like AWS eventually tie customers in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:04">[11:33:04]</a>.

## Geographic Influence on Platform Trust
[[awss_approach_to_cloud_computing_and_technology_strategy | Amazon's]] strategy with [[awss_business_model_and_financial_impact | AWS]] mirrors a "Microsoft strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:59">[12:03:59]</a>, focusing on platform administration and backwards compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. This approach is rooted in the "Seattle" culture, which is described as a "platform town" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. The ability to build a trusted foundation that locks in users, who are happy to be locked in, is a hallmark of this culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:10">[12:29:10]</a>.

In contrast, Silicon Valley companies like Google and Facebook are perceived as less trustworthy for platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:33">[12:42:33]</a>. Silicon Valley's focus is more on consumer-centric or "consumerized Enterprise technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:07">[12:46:07]</a>, where services are continuously upgraded on the backend, potentially leading to the removal of features or APIs that break customer operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. This difference in approach, potentially influenced by geography, contributes to the distinct competitive dynamics in the cloud services market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

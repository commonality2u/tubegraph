Linkabit's first commercial project was the development of the satellite communication system for [[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This marked a significant pivot for Linkabit, which had previously focused almost exclusively on [[innovations_in_satellite_communications_and_defense_contracting | defense contracting]] and government projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Linkabit's Shift to Commercial Work

Founded by Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi, [[linkabits_role_in_pay_tv_systems_and_its_acquisition | Linkabit]] initially served as a consulting firm, managing [[innovations_in_satellite_communications_and_defense_contracting | consulting work]] for NASA and Navy defense projects, particularly in satellite communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Their expertise lay in finding efficient ways to use narrow bandwidth channels for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Recognizing that prime contractors were making most of the money, Linkabit decided to bid on contracts themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. However, to grow beyond being a subcontractor, they needed to enter the commercial sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## The Walmart Satellite Network

[[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Walmart]], under its eccentric founder [[sam_waltons_business_strategies_and_philosophy | Sam Walton]], was a highly innovative retailer until the rise of [[awss_market_dynamics_and_strategic_approach | Amazon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Walmart]] invested tens of millions of dollars to build a private satellite relay network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This was necessary because the bandwidth available on the internet (which was then the ARPANET precursor) was insufficient for their operational needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

The satellite system served two primary purposes:
*   **Data Transmission**: It allowed [[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Walmart]] to send and tabulate store data on a daily or weekly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Internal Communications**: [[sam_waltons_business_strategies_and_philosophy | Sam Walton]] used the network to broadcast his "Saturday greetings" from headquarters to all local stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

[[linkabits_role_in_pay_tv_systems_and_its_acquisition | Linkabit]]'s expertise in [[innovations_in_satellite_communications_and_defense_contracting | satellite communications]] made them the ideal choice for this groundbreaking project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This collaboration highlights [[history_and_evolution_of_walmart | Walmart]]'s early adoption of advanced technology to gain a competitive edge in retail.

[[TSMCs future revenue strategy | TSMC]] exhibits a strategic approach of foregoing immediate profits for potential future gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This strategy is primarily aimed at securing future revenues through two main avenues: fostering customer loyalty and acquiring new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The underlying expectation is that an expanded customer base and increased revenue will yield more significant differential returns in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Unique Scale Economies

This forward-looking strategy is underpinned by [[TSMCs strategic decisions and partnerships | TSMC]]'s possession of a highly unusual type of scale economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Several distinct industry characteristics contribute to these unique scale economies:

### Large Capital Investment
The semiconductor industry demands exceptionally large and lumpy capital investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A single new fabrication plant (fab) can cost $10 billion or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This enormous upfront cost creates a significant barrier to entry and favors established players who can leverage their existing infrastructure.

### Predictable Performance Advances (Moore's Law)
Unlike many other industries, the semiconductor sector benefits from quote-unquote "predictable material performance advances," often associated with Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This means that if the correct technology choices are made, there is a relatively high assurance of substantial improvements, such as a tenfold performance increase within 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Such predictability in technological progress is highly unusual in most other fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> and is driven by making the right [[TSMCs strategic decisions and partnerships | technology choices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Reliance on Upstream Suppliers
A critical characteristic is that technological advantages are heavily influenced by upstream suppliers, such as ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This dependence necessitates difficult strategic decisions regarding supplier partnerships and technology paths. Historically, there have been extensive debates within semiconductor companies, for example, on whether to pursue x-ray lithography, which involved significant financial investment in research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

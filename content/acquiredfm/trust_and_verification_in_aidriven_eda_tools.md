From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 
Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools have undergone a significant transformation, moving from human-aided design to automated, and now, to [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI]]-driven optimization. This evolution has consistently challenged and redefined the concept of trust and verification within the semiconductor industry.

### Early Days of Synthesis
In the mid-1980s, when [[role_of_synopsys_in_electronic_design_automation_eda | Synopsys]] began developing synthesis tools, the concept of software automatically creating or altering a circuit design was "completely taboo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The prevailing belief was that if a tool changed a circuit, it likely introduced bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Creativity and the direct workflow were "reserved for the human, for the designer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

Initial prototypes of [[role_of_synopsys_in_electronic_design_automation_eda | Synopsys]]'s synthesis technology, known as Socrates, demonstrated astonishing results. Circuits that designers had spent weeks on could be returned in a few hours, 30% smaller (fewer gates) and 30% faster (shorter critical path) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Customers' initial reaction was often "it's impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, followed by two weeks of verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This rigorous self-verification led to trust, and customers became "parents of the tool" by providing crucial feedback that enabled continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. This collaborative feedback loop was essential, as the software was fundamentally changing circuits, a capability referred to as having "license to kill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI]] in Modern EDA
The challenge of trust reappeared when [[role_of_synopsys_in_electronic_design_automation_eda | Synopsys]] introduced [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI]] for synthesis and place and route in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. Users initially resisted, demanding to know what the [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI]] had changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. This "lack of trust" persisted for about two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, even though the [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI]]-driven outcomes were "always better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

Despite initial skepticism, [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI]] in EDA is now well-accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. The core reason is that EDA focuses on "massive optimization problems" involving billions of transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, a scale impossible for humans to manage manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI]] and machine learning algorithms are employed to optimize for specific goals like size, power efficiency, and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

### The Role of Verification
A crucial aspect of EDA is the absolute necessity for correctness. Unlike some generative [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI]] models that might be 90% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, EDA tools must meet "10 trillion constraints that tolerate zero error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. The cost of manufacturing a chip with a bug is prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

Therefore, even with [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI]]-generated designs, there are "many steps before you commit it to manufacturing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. These "many checks of verification" ensure the design will work once manufactured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This approach of "trust but verify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a> remains fundamental.

### Systemic Complexity and the Future
As the industry moves towards "systemic complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>, involving multi-die architectures and the integration of diverse physics (thermal, structural) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>, the role of trusted simulation tools becomes even more vital. [[synopsys_strategic_acquisition_of_ansys | Synopsys's acquisition of Ansys]] is a strategic move to address these challenges, combining [[role_of_synopsys_in_electronic_design_automation_eda | Synopsys]]'s expertise in electronics with Ansys's leadership in multiphysics simulation and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Ansys is recognized as a "trusted simulator" due to over 40 years of cumulative evolution in their simulation capabilities, offering "sign-off trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

The goal is to shift from expensive, time-consuming physical testing to extensive simulation and digital twinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>. Accelerated compute and [[building_ai_models_and_industry_implications | AI]] techniques are further enhancing simulation speed and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>, opening doors for broader applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This allows for optimization across entire systems, not just individual chips, addressing complexities related to power utilization and functionality that extend beyond the transistor level to the software layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. The continuous cycle of innovation, driven by customer demands and technological advancements, underscores the enduring importance of trust and rigorous verification in every step of the design process.

The podcast episode features a discussion with Eric Yuan, founder and CEO of Zoom, and Peter Gassner, founder and CEO of Veeva Systems, about their experiences with [[challenges_and_strategy_in_venture_capital_formation | capital efficient growth]] and fundraising for their respective companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This special episode, recorded at Emergence Capital's CEO summit, offers unique insights as it's uncommon for such discussions to be shared publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Fundraising Journeys

### Veeva Systems
Veeva Systems began in February 2007, raising an initial $3 million from angel investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. About 15 months later, they raised an additional $4 million from Emergence Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Peter Gassner notes that Veeva never actually used the Emergence $4 million, coming within $100,000 of it before going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. Despite this minimal capital consumption, Veeva grew into a $2 billion revenue business with incredible margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

### Zoom
Eric Yuan started Zoom in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. Initially, it was very difficult to raise capital, with no VCs wanting to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. He secured an initial $3 million in seed funding from friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. When attempting a Series A round, VCs again showed no interest, as most assumed video conferencing was either a settled market or a race to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. Eric persisted, securing another $6 million from friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

Zoom later raised a $30 million round led by Emergence Capital and another $100 million round from Sequoia, but similarly, the vast majority, if not all, of this $130 million was never touched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Eric stated they didn't even need the Series D funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. He made the decision to raise additional capital in 2016-2017 due to an expectation of an economic downturn, although he admits this was a miscalculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.

## Capital Efficiency as a Mindset and Culture
Both Peter and Eric agree that [[challenges_and_adaptations_in_venture_capital | capital efficiency]] is more of a mindset and culture than a business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

Key elements include:
*   **Running a Profitable Lemonade Stand**: Focus on cash generation for safety and long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.
*   **Product Excellence**: Both founders emphasize being "product people" and the importance of having a superior product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. An excellent product makes sales cycles more efficient and lowers customer acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:21:00">[41:21:00]</a>.
*   **Hard Work and Focus**: Maniacal focus on product and customer, avoiding distractions like conferences in the early years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   **Market Luck**: Recognizing that timing and luck in the market play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Obvious Ideas**: To be an outlier, one must pick something most people think will fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. Veeva, for example, was rejected by most VCs for being "vertical specific software that's a small market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. Eric's idea was seen as "crazy" by VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
*   **Clear and Correct Target Markets**: Despite picking non-obvious ideas, it's crucial to genuinely believe in the market's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. Peter listened to customers' "feelings" about existing solutions, not just what they said, identifying dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. Eric knew WebEx "really sucks" and that competitors like Skype and Google Talk were unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.

## Hiring and People Strategy
A crucial aspect of capital efficiency is the [[recruiting_founders_and_the_key_to_startup_success | hiring]] and people strategy.

*   **Early Focus on Engineers**: Zoom started with 25 engineers, quickly growing to 40, with Eric being the only non-engineer, focusing on product, UI, and facility management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. All initial funding went towards product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>.
*   **No Wasted People**: Both companies avoided "optional people" to prevent burning money and complicating decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>.
*   **Founder-Led Sales**: Peter was Veeva's first salesperson, selling before the company was even formally incorporated, building relationships and demonstrating product despite having no demo or team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. Eric similarly talked directly to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:33]</a>.
*   **Customer Feedback**: Instead of formal surveys, both founders personally engaged with early adopters to gauge satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:00">[26:39:00]</a>. Eric focused on the 100 most loyal users, knowing their happiness would drive network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring Leaders**:
    *   Initially, Zoom and Veeva preferred "up and comers" who could be hands-on and grow with the company, giving them opportunities to do something they hadn't done before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>. Chemistry was prioritized over individual skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:20:00">[43:20:00]</a>.
    *   Eric later reflected that this philosophy had a "big flaw" during hyper-growth (like COVID-19 pandemic), as the team wasn't ready for a 15-20x usage increase and 7x revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:11:00">[45:11:00]</a>. He now advises a "mixed team structure" with some seasoned [[role_of_management_and_decisionmaking_in_startups | leaders]] alongside those with growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.

## Product and Sales Strategies for Capital Efficiency
*   **Funding Product Development with Customer Revenue**: Veeva funded development with customer revenue, seeing large annual contracts as a non-dilutive capital raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>.
*   **Frugal Approach**: Peter thought of hiring like buying a million-dollar machine, asking if each person's cost was "worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>.
*   **Single-Year Contracts (Veeva)**: Veeva avoided multi-year deals to optimize for long-term annual value, ensuring they "earned the business every year" and preventing the company from becoming lazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:31:00">[32:31:00]</a>. This also allowed flexibility in pricing without historical lock-ins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Network Effects (Zoom)**: Given the horizontal nature of video conferencing, Zoom focused on product excellence, better pricing, and superior service to leverage network effects instead of a large sales force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>. This internal efficiency allowed them to offer better value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>.

## Marketing Strategies
*   **Delayed Marketing Investment (Zoom)**: Zoom had no marketing team for the first four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. Eric believed that if the product worked, marketing was less critical in a mature market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51:00">[48:51:00]</a>. Positive customer feedback like "I never heard about Zoom, but the product works" signaled it was time to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:00">[49:00:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive ROI Measurement**: When they did invest in marketing, Eric was highly disciplined, pushing for a 3x or 4x return on every dollar spent, not just 1.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:00:00">[50:00:00]</a>.
*   **Billboards for Validation and Morale**: Billboards were deployed not just for customer acquisition but to validate customers' decisions and boost employee morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:21:00">[51:21:00]</a>.

## Defensibility and Future Growth
The discussion also touched on how to sustain growth and build defensibility.

*   **Continuous Innovation**: Both companies emphasize "offense and defense" through continuous innovation, developing new services and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:29:00">[52:29:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Expansion**: Peter highlights the need to expand into different areas and offer new products to prevent stagnation in established areas. Veeva deliberately chose a second product (content CMS) that was "way out here" and not just an add-on to their first product, despite the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:16:00">[57:16:00]</a>. This risky move allowed them to become a multi-product company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:37:00">[57:37:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Planning**: Eric regrets not planning for new services 2-3 years in advance, realizing a single service limits growth trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:48:00">[55:48:00]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_management_and_decisionmaking_in_startups | Leadership]] Qualities**: Peter stresses auditing for integrity and energy within the [[role_of_management_and_decisionmaking_in_startups | leadership]] team to avoid arrogance, which can turn off customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:00">[54:30:00]</a>.
*   **Social Mission**: Veeva, as the first public company to convert to a B corporation, aims to be a profitable company that is also a good contributor to society and a good employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.
*   **Optimism and Perseverance**: Despite immense pressure, founders should remain optimistic and not dwell on failure scenarios, as this can hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>. Hard work and focus, driven by a deep personal desire to do one's best, are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.

The ability to build enormous impact with very little capital, as demonstrated by Zoom and Veeva, is highly impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This approach remains crucial, especially in changing market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.

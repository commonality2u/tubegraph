From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

[[Plaids journey from potential acquisition by Visa to market leadership | Visa]], along with Mastercard, has spent decades connecting banks, merchants, and consumers to enable global transactions with plastic cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Despite its global presence and recognition, most people cannot articulate what Visa does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Visa does not extend credit, issue cards, or work directly with merchants or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. It is not a bank or financial institution and bears no risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Visa is merely a network connecting banks to other banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

Visa is the 11th most valuable company globally, worth more than any bank involved in its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Its brand is among the most trusted worldwide, associated with reliability and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Early Payment Systems and the "Drop"

Historically, transferring money in the U.S. was difficult, primarily relying on cash or checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Checks involved discounts for processing (similar to modern interchange fees) and took a long time to clear, often relying on individual couriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. An Automated Clearing House (ACH) system for checks wasn't developed in the U.S. until the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

To solve this, merchants and their regular customers often used credit accounts or charge accounts, where tabs were kept on a ledger and settled monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This evolved into branded cards for all branches of a single brand (e.g., Standard Oil in 1939, which sent out 250,000 unsolicited cards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Later, groups of retailers in local areas collaborated on standardized charge account systems to simplify back-office operations and share credit histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. However, as these networks grew, internal competition intensified, and individual merchants lacked the resources to manage large networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

### Independent Third-Party Networks

This led to the emergence of independent, for-profit networks like Diner's Club and American Express <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Diner's Club (1950)**: Started as a charge card network primarily for business dining in Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. It charged restaurants 5-7% of the gross bill and later added fees for cardholders (companies paying the fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Diner's Club demonstrated the value of a shared credit history and consolidated billing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The high fees were partly due to the high costs of running these early networks without modern [[technological_innovations_in_payment_systems | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. It eventually grew to over a million members nationally before being acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.
*   **American Express (AMEX)**: Founded in 1850 by Henry Wells and William Fargo (who later founded Wells Fargo) as an express mail company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. By the 1950s, AMEX was primarily a traveler's checks business, which generated significant float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Seeing Diner's Club's success, AMEX launched its own charge card program in 1958, leveraging its existing relationships with companies, restaurants, and hotels to quickly sign up 700,000 members within a year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. AMEX was the first "bank-like" entity to enter the card market at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

### BankAmericard and the Fresno Drop (1958)
The largest bank in America at the time, the San Francisco-based Bank of America (BoA), decided to mail out rectangular plastic cards to all 65,000 of its customers in Fresno, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This event, known as "the drop," was done without advance warning or customer request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

BoA, unique among large banks for being consumer-focused (it originated as Bank of Italy, serving underbanked Italian immigrants and small businesses in California) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, had many disparate small consumer lending programs (e.g., for washing machines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. They saw a consumer credit card as a way to streamline these programs and significantly increase loan volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

The BankAmericard, as it was called, combined the convenience of a charge card with the option to roll over a balance into a loan, thereby inventing the modern credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. Crucially, in California, most merchants also banked with BoA, meaning the money often never left BoA's hands, creating valuable "float" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

However, the indiscriminate distribution of cards and lack of proper risk underwriting led to mass chaos, including $20 million in fraud and a 22% delinquency rate in the first pilot program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. This was due to the unsecured nature of credit card lending compared to previous secured loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. Despite the initial losses, BoA, as a large consumer bank, could absorb them and saw the long-term potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

> "Despite the denunciations, despite the free floating anxiety, Americans have always borrowed money to buy things, if not from a bank, then from somebody from a finance company or a credit union or a department store or a loan shark for that matter. There isn't another Western country that has relied so heavily on consumer credit. Between 1958 and 1990, there was never a year where the amount of outstanding consumer debt wasn't higher than the year before. Years later, a Bank of America executive could look back on his lifetime in the credit card industry and say proudly, 'Consumer credit built this country.' Whatever one's feelings about personal debt is difficult to disagree with this assertion." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>

By 1961, the program became profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. BoA intentionally kept this a secret, leading other banks to abandon similar programs due to perceived high losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. From 1960 to 1966, only 10 new credit cards were introduced in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.

## The Birth of Visa: De Hock's Vision

In 1966, Bank of America began licensing the BankAmericard program and network to other consumer banks across the country, aiming for nationwide expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. This licensing model involved a $25,000 franchise fee and a percentage of gross transaction revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. Within two years, by 1968, hundreds of banks had signed up, and there were 6 million cardholders, including international banks like Barclay's in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.

However, the franchise model created significant problems as the network expanded beyond BoA's closed-loop system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. When different banks (issuing banks for cardholders and acquiring banks for merchants) were involved in a transaction, the lack of standardized interchange and operational services led to chaos, relying on manual, decentralized processes like mailing sales drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. BoA's response was that they had sold a marketing system, not an operational one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>.

### The Columbus Summit (1968) and De Hock's Intervention
In October 1968, frustrated licensee banks demanded a summit in Columbus, Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. BoA sent only two mid-level marketing managers, signaling their lack of seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>. During this meeting, De Hock, the BankAmericard franchisee program manager from Seattle National Bank of Commerce (later Rainier Bank, eventually acquired by BoA), proposed a radical idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. He suggested that the committee of licensees design and propose a new operating model for the entire system, rather than just compiling grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. De Hock, despite his humble origins and lack of formal education, was a brilliant debater and strategist, believing in the power of persuasion and incentive alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.

> "Any organization that could guarantee transport and settle transactions in the form of arranged electronic particles... 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, around the globe would have a market every exchange of value in the world that beggared the imagination. The necessary [[Technological Innovations in Payment Systems | technology]] had been discovered and would be available in geometrically increasing abundance at geometrically diminishing costs. But there was a problem: no bank could do it, no hierarchical stock corporation could do it, no nation state could do it. In fact, no existing form of organization we could think of could do it. On a hunch, I made an estimate of the financial resources of all the banks in the world. It dwarfed the resources of most nations. Jointly they could do it. But how? It would require a transcendental organization linking together in wholly new ways an unimagined complex of diverse institutions and individuals." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>

De Hock's plan for this "transcendental organization" was based on four key principles:
1.  **For-profit non-stock Membership Corporation**: Ownership was tied to irrevocable, non-transferable rights of participation, based on volume contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>. This "reverse holding company" model ensured banks couldn't sell their stake and disincentivize participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>. The NFL was used as an analogy: team owners own the NFL, which sets the rules for how the game is played <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>.
2.  **Self-organizing body with democratic governance**: Every member bank had a vote, and a high threshold (80%) for changes ensured stability and compelled cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>.
3.  **Mission of cooperation and trust**: The organization would facilitate collaboration among competing banks to grow the network beyond what any single institution could achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>. It also initially prohibited banks from participating in competing networks (a rule later overturned by antitrust lawsuits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>.
4.  **Universal operating and governing procedures**: All members agreed to be bound by a singular, modifiable constitution, which could be changed by an 80% member vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:14">[01:22:14]</a>.

Amazingly, De Hock convinced every single one of the over 200 BankAmericard franchisee banks to sign up for this new organization, National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI), by 1970-1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>. He also secured a "Hall Pass" from the Department of Justice, arguing that the system's profound utility to consumers and businesses justified the industry collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:36">[01:24:36]</a>.

### Global Expansion and the "Visa" Name
In 1972, De Hock created a parallel international organization for banks using the BankAmericard system, making [[Plaids journey from potential acquisition by Visa to market leadership | Visa]] global from nearly day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:59">[01:26:09]</a>. To unify the global brand, NBI and IBANCO rebranded to **Visa** in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>. The name "Visa" was chosen for its universality in nearly every language and its association with travel and entry passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>.

The standardized Visa card design featured the iconic blue, white, and gold bands (representing California hillsides) in the middle, while allowing issuing banks to place their own branding and co-brands (e.g., airline affinity cards) on the top blue band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>. This flexibility encouraged banks to acquire more cardholders, which benefited the entire network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

The name change served as a growth hack. When the new Visa cards were rolled out, some banks proactively sent unsolicited letters to consumers who already had BankAmericards from other banks, prompting them to switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>. This "arms race" led to a 20% increase in participating banks and a 45% increase in active cardholders in just one year (1977-1978) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:13">[01:37:13]</a>, propelling Visa past Master Charge (formerly Interbank) in market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>.

## Technological Innovations

The realization of De Hock's vision required significant [[Technological Innovations in Payment Systems | technological innovations]] in parallel with the organizational changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>.

1.  **Transaction Authorizations (Visanet)**: Initially, transactions above a "floor limit" required a slow, manual phone call between the merchant's bank and the cardholder's bank to verify credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>. In 1971, De Hock launched "BASE" (BankAmericard Authorization System Experimental) to automate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>. After failed attempts to partner with firms like IBM and American Express, Visa decided to build the system in-house, recruiting Aram Tulan from TRW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:47">[01:56:47]</a>. In just nine months, Tulan's team built a nationwide telecom network, installed computer systems in member banks, and created a centralized data center in San Mateo, California (still Visa's headquarters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:25">[01:57:25]</a>. This system, known as Visanet, eliminated phone calls for authorizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:48">[01:52:48]</a>. Notably, Visa innovated by creating a system that ran concurrently across multiple data centers, a pioneering achievement at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:41">[02:06:41]</a>.

2.  **Settlement Digitization (BASE II)**: Following authorization, Visa needed to automate the reconciliation and movement of money, which was a complex N-squared problem when done manually with paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:41">[02:00:41]</a>. Visa built its own automated clearing house system, "BASE II," in the 1970s, independently and concurrently with the Federal Reserve building its own ACH system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>. This reduced average settlement time from a week to overnight batch processing, saving banks millions in labor and postage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:12">[02:03:12]</a>.

3.  **Point of Sale Digitization**: This involved making cards machine-readable and digitizing merchant terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:31">[02:07:31]</a>. Visa standardized on magnetic stripe [[Technological Innovations in Payment Systems | technology]] for cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:17">[02:09:17]</a>. For digital point-of-sale terminals, Visa developed specifications and incentivized merchants with discounts on transaction fees for using them (e.g., devices from Verifone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:23">[02:10:23]</a>. To connect these terminals, Visa rented excess network capacity from CompuServe (an early internet service) for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. This full digitization significantly reduced fraud, cutting chargebacks by 82% during the pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:13:51]</a>. By making its operations entirely digital, Visa achieved near-zero marginal costs and infinite scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:22">[02:15:22]</a>.

## Marketing and Global Dominance

A key part of Visa's global dominance was its marketing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:41">[02:16:41]</a>. In 1986, the Olympics first offered global sponsorships. American Express, a long-time Olympic sponsor, declined a sweetheart offer, which Visa, under new CMO John Bennett, seized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>. Visa invested $40 million (about $110 million today) in the 1988 Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>, becoming the exclusive payment provider. This sponsorship and the "It's Everywhere You Want to Be" campaign (which strategically positioned Visa against American Express by highlighting its broader acceptance) helped eliminate the social stigma around using credit cards for everyday purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>. Visa has remained the exclusive global payments sponsor of the Olympics through 2032 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:59">[02:23:59]</a>.

## IPO and Current Business Model

Visa went public in 2008 as the largest U.S. IPO to that point, raising $18 billion at a $90 billion initial market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:35">[02:27:35]</a>. This move was partly precipitated by a major class-action lawsuit from merchants regarding interchange fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:24">[02:25:24]</a>. To protect new shareholders, Visa created B shares that held all the liability from the lawsuit, ensuring a successful IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:52">[02:26:52]</a>. The $18 billion in secondary sales provided a lifeline to many banks during the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:06">[02:28:06]</a>.

Today, Visa's business model remains largely unchanged since the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:15">[02:29:15]</a>. It operates a five-sided system: consumer, merchant, Visa network, issuing bank, and acquiring bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:45">[02:35:45]</a>.
*   **Merchant Discount Rate**: Merchants pay a discount rate on sales (e.g., 2% for large U.S. credit card transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:09">[02:31:09]</a>.
    *   **Interchange Fees**: The largest portion (e.g., 1.6%) goes to the issuing bank, which uses it for customer acquisition and rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:21">[02:31:21]</a>.
    *   **Payment Processing Fees**: A smaller portion (e.g., 0.2%) goes to the acquiring bank and its [[Technological Innovations in Payment Systems | technology]] provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:54">[02:31:54]</a>.
    *   **Network Fees (Assessment Fees)**: A very small portion (e.g., 0.15-0.2%) goes to Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:37">[02:32:37]</a>. Visa's share has virtually no variable costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:12">[02:33:12]</a>, contributing to its absurdly high net income margins.
*   **Flexibility**: Interchange is intentionally flexible, allowing the ecosystem to spread value to incentivize different parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:50">[02:34:50]</a>.
*   **Debit vs. Credit**: Debit card fees are significantly lower, often due to regulatory reasons, as there's no credit risk involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:59">[02:33:59]</a>. Debit cards were introduced decades after credit cards on the Visa network due to initial bank resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:26">[02:54:26]</a>.

### Key Statistics (2023)
*   **Volume**: $14 trillion (17.3% compounded annual growth since 1971) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:06">[02:46:06]</a>.
*   **Transactions**: 190 billion (27 transactions per person on Earth annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:11">[02:47:11]</a>.
*   **Cards in Circulation**: 4.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:29">[02:47:29]</a>.
*   **Revenue**: $29 billion (up from $22 billion two years prior), with Value Added Services accounting for $6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>.
*   **Net Income Margins**: 50% ($15 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:23">[02:48:23]</a>. This is higher than Microsoft (34%), Apple (25%), and Google (21%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:52">[02:49:52]</a>.
*   **Gross Margins**: 98% (no variable costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:19">[02:49:19]</a>.
*   **Employees**: 27,000 (similar to [[history_and_evolution_of_nvidias_technology | Nvidia]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:30">[02:50:30]</a>.
*   **Uptime**: 99.999% (5 nines) for its six global data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:25">[02:51:25]</a>.

## Value Creation and Capture

Visa creates immense value by enabling frictionless, instant, and often credit-extending payments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:43">[02:46:43]</a>. It has been foundational to the rise of e-commerce, which would not have scaled without credit card networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>. For merchants, credit cards offer guaranteed payment, instant authorization, and attract more buyers, while reducing the costs and risks associated with handling cash or checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:09">[02:45:09]</a>.

However, the system also captures significant value. U.S. merchants paid an estimated $93 billion in Visa and Mastercard credit card fees last year, up from $33 billion in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:27">[02:55:27]</a>. The prevailing interchange model, where consumers receive rewards funded by merchant fees, is often seen as a "reverse Robin Hood" scenario, where wealthier consumers benefit at the expense of all consumers through inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:37">[02:41:37]</a>. On average, a cash-using household pays $149 annually in inflated prices, while a card-using household receives $1,100 in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:25">[02:42:25]</a>.

The system is tough to change because consumers who spend the most love the rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:44">[02:40:44]</a>, and no single retailer has enough power to create a competing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:01">[02:40:01]</a>.

## Power and Playbook

### Power
*   **Scale Economies**: Visa's massive scale allows it to amortize fixed R&D costs across billions of transactions and millions of participants, making it nearly impossible for new entrants to compete on cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:42">[03:05:42]</a>.
*   **Network Economies**: Visa benefits from a rare "five-sided" network effect, involving consumers, merchants, Visa, issuing banks, and acquiring banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:15">[03:07:15]</a>. The complexity of building and maintaining such a vast, interlocking system makes it nearly unbreakable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:23">[03:08:23]</a>.
*   **Counter-positioning (Historical)**: In its early days, Bank of America had unique counter-positioning as the only bank large enough and with the right California-specific market dynamics to absorb initial losses and bootstrap the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:52">[03:09:52]</a>.

### Playbook
*   **Toll Booth Business**: Visa operates as a highly profitable "toll booth," charging a fee for every transaction on its essential global network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:28">[03:10:28]</a>.
*   **Incentive Alignment**: Visa masterfully aligns incentives across its complex ecosystem. New products and features (like tokenization or "value added services") are framed as benefits for security or privacy, but also enhance Visa's transaction volume, margin, or lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:01">[03:11:01]</a>.
*   **Communist Capitalism / Democratic Capitalism**: Visa is a premier example of "communist capitalism," where competitors (banks) band together to create more value than they could alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:40">[03:11:40]</a>. Its democratic governance structure, with thousands of member banks having a vote, makes it unique in global financial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:26">[03:12:26]</a>.
*   **Sociotechnical Innovation**: Visa's success is a testament to both its organizational (social) innovation in creating the multi-sided network and its [[Technological Innovations in Payment Systems | technological innovation]] in building the underlying digital infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:21">[03:13:21]</a>.

## Bear and Bull Cases for Visa

### Bear Cases
*   **Market Maturity**: Over 50% of global consumer payments to merchants now occur on cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:05">[03:21:05]</a>. This means the historical tailwind of shifting payments to digital methods will decelerate, potentially slowing Visa's core business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:38">[03:21:38]</a>.
*   **Closed-Loop Systems / Super Apps**: The rise of closed-loop systems like Alipay or Tencent's ecosystem in China, or even the Starbucks app if it were to disintermediate cards, poses a threat if banks and merchants can go direct to consumers without involving card networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:56">[03:21:56]</a>.
*   **Real-time Payment Networks**: Governments and countries adopting real-time payment networks (e.g., FedNow in the US, Pix in Brazil, UPI in India) could bypass traditional card rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:04">[03:24:04]</a>. The linkage of these networks across geographies (e.g., Singapore and India) creates direct money transfer methods outside Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Apple/Google Pay**: While currently running on Visa's rails, these mobile wallets erode the card issuer's role in the consumer's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:11">[03:28:11]</a>. Apple, for example, takes an extra 15 basis points on Apple Pay transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:41">[03:25:41]</a>. If Apple were to acquire a point-of-sale provider like Square or Verifone and link it with its own card (e.g., Apple Card), it could create its own closed-loop network, bypassing Visa entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:59">[03:26:59]</a>.

### Bull Cases
*   **Dominant Network Effect**: Visa's well-established, five-sided network effect, built over 50 years, is incredibly powerful and has consistently outpaced competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:21">[03:30:21]</a>.
*   **Historical Resilience**: Despite numerous past bear cases, Visa has consistently achieved low double-digit (historically 17%) growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:57">[03:30:57]</a>.
*   **Tokenization**: The shift to tokenized transactions (where a token replaces the actual card number for security) allows Visa to create more proprietary, high-margin services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:41">[03:31:41]</a>.
*   **Expansion into New Markets**: Visa sees a massive addressable market beyond traditional consumer card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:03">[03:33:03]</a>.
    *   **B2B Payments**: A $120 trillion market, where Visa can leverage its network for corporate cards (e.g., Ramp, Brex) and develop new B2B-specific products with appropriate monetization models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:22">[03:33:22]</a>.
    *   **Business-to-Consumer (B2C) Payments**: A $30 trillion market for push-based payments (e.g., insurance payouts, refunds, gig worker payments) through products like Visa Direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:10">[03:34:10]</a>.
    *   **Cross-border Payments**: Expanding international transactions is highly profitable due to much higher margins than domestic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>.
*   **Apple/Google as Allies**: As of today, Apple Pay and Google Pay still rely on Visa's rails for underlying transactions, serving as a tokenized delivery mechanism rather than a direct competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:31">[03:35:31]</a>. Visa continues to capture value from these transactions.

### Fun Fact
The BankAmericard credit card, still offered by Bank of America today, runs on Mastercard's network, not Visa's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:15">[03:38:15]</a>.

From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Visa is an "absolutely incredible system" that allows individuals to transact anywhere in the world with a piece of plastic, without the merchant or consumer needing to know or trust each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Along with Mastercard, Visa has tirelessly spent decades connecting banks, merchants, and consumers to make this possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Despite its global presence and recognition, most people cannot articulate what Visa does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Visa itself does not extend credit, issue cards, or work directly with merchants or consumers; it is not a bank or financial institution and bears no risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Instead, it acts as a network connecting banks to other banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Visa is the 11th most valuable company in the world, worth more than any bank involved in its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The Origins: "The Drop" in Fresno

The story of Visa begins in September 1958 in Fresno, California, with an event known as "the drop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Bank of America (BofA), then the largest bank in America, mailed rectangular plastic pieces to all 65,000 of its customers in Fresno, completely unsolicited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. These were credit cards, but people at the time had no idea what they were or how to use them, leading to "mass chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. There was no public demand for such a device; it simply "arrived one day with no advance warning as if it had dropped out of the sky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Banking Landscape in the Mid-20th Century

In the 1950s, Bank of America was unique among large U.S. banks as it focused on consumer banking, unlike white-shoe corporate banks like J.P. Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Interstate banking was illegal, and most states restricted the number of branches a bank could have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. California was an exception, allowing statewide branching and having a large population, making it the only place to build a large consumer bank like BofA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

BofA's business involved numerous small, disparate consumer loans, including mortgages, car loans, and even "washing machine loans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Each purchase required a manual, in-person loan process at a bank branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This inefficient system made the idea of a consumer credit card highly appealing for streamlining and consolidating lending programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Evolution of Payment Systems

Historically, transferring money in the U.S. was difficult, mainly relying on cash or checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Checks involved discounts due to processing costs and risks, similar to modern interchange fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Manual check processing was slow and complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Automated Clearing House (ACH) systems, which streamline such processes, weren't developed in the U.S. until the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

Merchants and their regular customers adopted credit or "charge accounts" to simplify transactions, where tabs were kept and settled monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This evolved into branded cards for specific chains, like Standard Oil's unsolicited card mailed to 250,000 customers in 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Later, local retailers formed collaborations for shared charge account systems, which offered consumers convenience and merchants a shared credit history, reducing loan defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### The Rise of Independent Networks: Diners Club and American Express

The growth of collaborative merchant networks introduced intense competition and operational challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. This paved the way for independent, for-profit networks like Diners Club and American Express <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

Diners Club, founded in 1950 (not 1949 as per a fabricated story), targeted business professionals dining in Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. It allowed members to dine without cash, receiving a single monthly statement that *had* to be paid in full (no revolving credit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Diners Club charged restaurants a significant 5-7% discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. They also charged cardholders a fee, typically paid by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

American Express (AMX), founded in 1850 by Henry Wells and William Fargo, started as an express mail company and later became known for traveler's checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. Observing Diners Club, AMX launched its own charge card program in 1958, quickly signing up 700,000 members due to existing relationships with businesses and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. AMX was the first "real financial company" to enter this market at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

### BankAmericard: The Modern Credit Card

Bank of America's BankAmericard, launched in Fresno in 1958, differed significantly from charge cards by offering revolving credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. Customers could pay their statement in full or "roll it into a loan," aligning with BofA's core lending business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. This innovation "turbocharged" consumer lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

A key benefit for BofA was that when a customer used their BankAmericard at a BofA-banking merchant (common in California), the money never left BofA's hands, freeing up capital and increasing float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

However, the indiscriminate mailing of 65,000 cards in Fresno led to "mass chaos" and significant financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Within the first pilot, there was $20 million in fraud, and 22% of the credit issued resulted in default or delinquency, much higher than traditional lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. This was due to the unsecured nature of credit card lending, unlike previous secured loans for specific items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

BofA, being large enough, could absorb these losses and instead of pulling the plug, they expanded the program across California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. Within the first year, they signed up 20,000 merchants and 2 million cardholders in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>, becoming the largest charge card/credit card program globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. By 1961, the program was profitable, but BofA kept this quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. This secrecy led many other banks to abandon their own credit card efforts, believing it was a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

## The Birth of Visa: From Licensees to a Global Network

The secret of BankAmericard's profitability came out in 1966 when BofA created the BankAmericard Service Organization (BASO) to license the program to banks nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. Licensees paid BofA a $25,000 franchise fee plus a percentage of gross transaction revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. Within two years (by 1968), hundreds of banks had signed up, accumulating 6 million cardholders across the U.S. and internationally (e.g., Barclays Bank in the UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.

This expansion exposed problems: BofA's internal closed-loop system didn't translate well to an "open-loop" network where different banks handled card issuing and merchant acquiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. This created the need for standardized interchange, which BofA was not providing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. Frustrated licensees, who felt BofA only sold them a "marketing system" rather than a fully operational one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>, demanded a summit in Columbus, Ohio, in October 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.

### Dee Hock and the "Transcendental Organization"

At the Columbus summit, BofA sent only two mid-level marketing managers, angering the franchisee banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>. Dee Hock, the BankAmericard program manager from the small Seattle National Bank of Commerce (later Rainier Bank, ironically acquired by BofA in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>), was appointed to a committee to investigate operational problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>.

Hock, an outsider with an associates degree and a history of being fired for insubordination, envisioned a "transcendental organization" that could link diverse institutions for global value exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. He convinced the BofA representatives to allow his committee to design a new operating system for the entire network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.

In Sausalito, California, Hock and his committee designed the principles for the new entity, National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI):
1.  **For-profit Non-stock Membership Corporation**: Ownership was based on "irrevocable, non-transferable rights of participation" (volume contributed), not stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. Profits were returned proportionally to members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. This structure was designed to prevent individual banks from selling their interest and to align incentives.
2.  **Self-organizing with Democratic Governance**: Every member bank had a vote, and any member could call a vote, though an 80% threshold was required for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>. This effectively gave Hock significant control as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>. This is an example of [[History and Evolution of the NFL | Communist Capitalism]], where competitors collaborate for mutual benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.
3.  **Cooperation among Competitors**: The mission was to facilitate trust and cooperation among competing banks to grow the network beyond any single institution's capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. Members were implicitly forbidden from participating in competing networks, which would later be challenged by antitrust laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>.
4.  **Universal Operating Procedures**: A singular, universally binding set of rules, modifiable by an 80% member vote, governed all operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:14">[01:22:14]</a>.

Miraculously, Hock convinced Bank of America to cede control of the BankAmericard program and all 200+ franchisee banks to join NBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>. He even secured a "hall pass" letter from the Department of Justice, exempting the collaboration from antitrust concerns due to its profound utility to consumers and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:36">[01:24:36]</a>.

### International Expansion and the "Visa" Name

In 1972, Hock formed a parallel international organization called International BankAmericard Inc. (IBANCO) to expand the system globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. This was even harder, as international banks had to weigh joining a global network versus potentially dominating their own country's payment market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>. Hock's persuasive skills, including a dramatic presentation with "pure gold cuff links" symbolizing "the will to succeed" and "the grace to compromise," convinced holdouts to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:38">[01:28:38]</a>.

Shortly after, NBI and IBANCO rebranded to **Visa** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. The name "Visa" was chosen for its universality across languages and its implication of an "entry pass" to global commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>. The iconic blue, white, and gold bands, inspired by Californian hills, remained a universal mark of acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>. Visa allowed individual banks to co-brand the cards with their own logos and affinity programs, leading to the proliferation of diverse card designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>.

The name change itself served as an "incredible growth hack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>. The mandate to migrate existing BankAmericards to Visa cards led to an "arms race" among banks to poach cardholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>. In one year (1977-1978), the number of participating banks grew by 20%, and active cardholders by 45%, propelling Visa past its competitor, Master Charge (now Mastercard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>.

## [[Technological innovations in payment processing | Technological Innovations in Payment Processing]]

The vision of an instant global payment network required significant technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>. When Dee Hock arrived, transactions requiring authorization over a "floor limit" (e.g., $50) involved lengthy phone calls between merchant banks and cardholder banks, taking up to 20 minutes and limited by business hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

1.  **Authorization (BASE I)**: In 1971, Hock initiated Project BASE (BankAmericard Authorization System Experimental) to automate transaction authorizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>. After a failed attempt at a joint venture with American Express due to [[Failed Visa acquisition and antitrust issues | antitrust issues]], Visa decided to build the technology in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Aram Tulan was hired from TRW to lead the tech team, and within nine months, they built a nationwide (and later worldwide) telecommunications network and centralized data center (the San Mateo campus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. Hock famously insisted on "uncompromising deadlines" for computer projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:39">[01:58:39]</a>.
2.  **Settlement (BASE II / Automated Clearing House)**: The next challenge was digitizing transaction settlement, which involved massive paper-based reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:40">[01:59:40]</a>. Visa built its own internal Automated Clearing House (ACH) system, called BASE II, concurrently with the Federal Reserve building its own ACH system for checks in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>. BASE II was live in less than a year, reducing average settlement time from a week to overnight batch processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:08">[02:03:08]</a>. This saved banks an estimated $15 million in labor and postage in its first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:40">[02:03:40]</a>.
    *   **Reliability Innovation**: During this period, a Visa engineer raised concerns about the single, wooden data center in California being vulnerable near the San Andreas fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:16">[02:04:16]</a>. Hock mandated building a redundant data center on the East Coast within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:31">[02:05:31]</a>. Visa's tech team innovated by re-architecting their systems to run concurrently across multiple data centers, a novel approach for its time and now standard practice globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:31">[02:06:31]</a>.
3.  **Point of Sale Digitization**: The final step was to digitize the card itself and the merchant's point-of-sale (POS) terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:37">[02:07:37]</a>. Visa standardized on magnetic stripe technology for cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:17">[02:09:17]</a>. For POS terminals, Visa created specifications, and companies like Verifone rose to prominence to mass-produce inexpensive hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:20">[02:10:20]</a>. Merchants were incentivized with discounts on transaction fees for using digital terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>. For its merchant network, Visa initially partnered with CompuServe, renting its unused network capacity during off-peak hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:17">[02:12:17]</a>. This full digitization significantly reduced fraud, cutting chargebacks by 82% in pilot programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:13:51]</a>.

## Modern Business Model and IPO

By the time all pieces were digitized, Visa could scale infinitely with essentially zero marginal cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:29">[02:15:29]</a>. Dee Hock was ousted from the company in 1984, as his zero-to-one entrepreneurial style wasn't suited for continued scale-up, especially with conservative financial institutions as shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:46">[02:18:46]</a>.

In 1986, Visa embarked on a [[Global payment systems and market expansion | global marketing strategy]] by becoming the founding global sponsor of the Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>. This allowed them to position against American Express, which had declined the sponsorship, and eliminate the social stigma of using credit cards for everyday purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:59">[02:19:59]</a>. The campaign tagline, "It's everywhere you want to be," highlighted Visa's widespread acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>. Visa remains the exclusive payment provider for the Olympics through 2032 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:56">[02:23:56]</a>.

### The 2008 IPO

Visa went public in 2008, largely precipitated by a major [[Failed Visa acquisition and antitrust issues | antitrust class action lawsuit]] brought by merchants in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:06">[02:25:06]</a>. To manage the liability, Visa created "B shares" to which all past class action liabilities were isolated, protecting new "A share" public shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:52">[02:26:52]</a>. The IPO, during the 2008 financial crisis, raised $18 billion (secondary sales to existing bank owners) at a $90 billion initial market cap, becoming the largest U.S. IPO at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:35">[02:27:35]</a>. This provided a crucial lifeline for many banks during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:06">[02:28:06]</a>.

### Visa Today

Visa's business model remains largely unchanged since the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:15">[02:29:15]</a>. It's a five-sided system involving the consumer, merchant, issuing bank, acquiring bank, and Visa as the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:45">[02:35:45]</a>. The "merchant discount rate" charged to merchants (e.g., 2% for large U.S. credit card transactions) is split:
*   **Interchange Fee (1.6%)**: Goes to the issuing bank, covering fraud risk and enabling rewards programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:21">[02:31:21]</a>.
*   **Payment Processing Fees (0.2%)**: Goes to the acquiring bank and its technology provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:54">[02:31:54]</a>.
*   **Network Fees (0.15-0.2%)**: Goes to Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:37">[02:32:37]</a>. Visa's share has "basically no variable costs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:12">[02:33:12]</a>.

In 2022, Visa processed $14 trillion in volume (17.3% CAGR since 1971) and over 190 billion transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:06">[02:46:06]</a>. With 4.1 billion cards in circulation and 27,000 employees, its net revenue was $29 billion, and net income margins were 50% (gross margins 98%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>. Visa boasts 99.999% uptime across its six global data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:25">[02:51:25]</a>.

Visa's interchange system is intentionally flexible to align incentives across the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:50">[02:34:50]</a>. Consumers, especially those with rewards cards, largely benefit from the current system, often receiving significant value back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:44">[02:39:44]</a>. This makes it difficult for merchants to challenge the system, as consumers are disincentivized to switch to alternative payment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:01">[02:40:01]</a>.

## Power Analysis

Applying Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers framework to Visa and Mastercard as a collective duopoly reveals:

*   **Scale Economies**: Yes. Any fixed-cost investment Visa makes is amortized across billions of transactions and thousands of banks globally, making it nearly impossible for competitors to match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:42">[03:05:42]</a>.
*   **Network Economies**: Yes. This is a "five-sided network effect" with consumers, merchants, issuing banks, acquiring banks, and the Visa network amplifying each other's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:15">[03:07:15]</a>. The complexity and scale of this network make it "basically unbreakable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:28">[03:08:28]</a>.
*   **Switching Costs**: Low for individual banks between Visa and Mastercard due to antitrust rulings allowing "duality" (multi-homing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:57">[03:08:57]</a>. However, there are high switching costs for the entire market to move away from the Visa/Mastercard oligopoly.
*   **Counter-Positioning**: Yes, in the early days, Bank of America had unique counter-positioning as the only bank large enough and with the right market dynamics to launch and absorb the losses of the BankAmericard program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:52">[03:09:52]</a>.

## Playbook & Lessons

*   **Toll Booth Business**: Visa operates as a high-functioning toll booth on the global economy's most essential roads, where everyone must drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:05]</a>.
*   **[[History and Evolution of the NFL | Communist Capitalism]]**: Visa is a prime example of "communist capitalism" or "democratic communist capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:38">[03:11:38]</a>. Competitors (banks) banded together to create more value than they could alone, submitting to a centralized governance structure for collective benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:05">[03:12:05]</a>. This was immensely difficult to achieve with thousands of entities, especially when starting from a point of existing individual franchises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:50">[03:12:50]</a>.
*   **Socio-Technical Innovation**: Visa's success stems from both its organizational (socio) innovations, like its unique governance structure, and its technological advancements in payment processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:28">[03:13:28]</a>. These aspects were often underestimated due to the company's non-traditional ownership and lack of venture capital funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:46">[03:14:46]</a>.

## Value Creation vs. Value Capture

*   **Value Creation**: Visa has created immense value, most notably enabling e-commerce, which would have been impossible or severely delayed without widely accepted credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:51">[03:18:51]</a>. It provides guaranteed payment, instant authorization, and reduces the operational costs of handling cash or checks for merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:25">[02:44:25]</a>.
*   **Value Capture**: With its "incredible profit margin" and a market where competition is limited, Visa and its partners capture significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:27">[03:15:27]</a>. Critics argue that the system is regressive, as higher interchange fees (e.g., from rewards cards) mean all consumers, including cash-payers, subsidize the rewards of wealthier card-users through inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:30">[02:41:30]</a>. For small transactions, the fixed 30-cent fee can be disproportionately high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:53">[03:16:53]</a>.

## Bear & Bull Cases

### Bear Cases

*   **Maturing Core Business**: Over 50% of consumer payments already occur on cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:05">[03:21:05]</a>, suggesting a deceleration in the long-standing tailwind of digital payment adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:24">[03:21:24]</a>.
*   **Closed-Loop Systems and Super Apps**: The rise of closed-loop ecosystems, like Alipay and Tencent's WeChat in China, demonstrate how a significant volume of payments can flow outside credit card networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:56">[03:21:56]</a>. Such systems could disintermediate Visa if a bank and merchant go direct to consumers for digital payments without card networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:42">[03:22:42]</a>.
*   **Real-Time Payment Networks**: Instant bank transfer networks (e.g., FedNow in the US, Pix in Brazil, UPI in India) are emerging globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:06">[03:24:06]</a>. If these networks develop payment features and gain cross-border functionality, they could bypass Visa's rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:58">[03:24:58]</a>.
*   **Apple Pay (and Google Pay)**: While currently using Visa's rails, Apple Pay takes an additional 15 basis points per transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:41">[03:25:41]</a>. If Apple were to acquire a POS hardware provider like Block (Square) and integrate it with Apple Pay, they could potentially create a closed-loop system, cutting out Visa entirely for transactions involving Apple products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:51">[03:26:51]</a>. Furthermore, consumers increasingly view their phone as the payment method, diminishing the card brand's role in their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:04">[03:28:04]</a>.

### Bull Cases

*   **Unbreakable Network Effect**: Visa benefits from an incredibly powerful and entrenched five-sided network effect developed over 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:21">[03:30:21]</a>. Many past bear cases have failed to materialize as Visa continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:47">[03:30:47]</a>.
*   **Tokenization**: The shift from raw card numbers to tokenized card credentials (as used in Apple Pay) creates more proprietary services for Visa. This allows Visa to layer high-margin services on top of transactions and enhances security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:41">[03:31:41]</a>.
*   **Market Expansion**: Visa sees a massive addressable market beyond traditional consumer card payments.
    *   **B2B Payments**: Valued at $120 trillion, Visa is excited about addressing this market through corporate cards (like Ramp/Brex) and developing new B2B-specific products with appropriate monetization models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:19">[03:33:19]</a>.
    *   **Business-to-Consumer (B2C) Payments**: A $30 trillion opportunity, including insurance payouts, refunds, and gig economy driver payments. Visa Direct is a new initiative addressing push-based B2C payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:15">[03:34:15]</a>.
    *   **Cross-Border Payments**: International transactions are "ludicrously profitable" for Visa due to higher margins from currency conversion and network fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:25">[03:20:25]</a>. Continued expansion in this area is a significant growth driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>.

## Trivia

The BankAmericard credit card is still available today from Bank of America, but ironically, it runs on Mastercard's network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

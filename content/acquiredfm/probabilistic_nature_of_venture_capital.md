From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

[[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | Venture capital]] is characterized as a "probabilistic endeavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This approach involves seeking extremely high expected value investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, even though the typical outcome for individual bets is a loss of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. The strategy relies on making a sufficient number of these bets so that, on average, they yield a significant return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Contrast with Traditional Investing Principles

Traditional [[application_of_traditional_investing_principles_to_venture_capital | investing principles]], often emphasized in business education, stress the importance of avoiding permanent capital loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. However, [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | venture capital]] does not adhere to this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Unlike a portfolio where every company is expected to deliver a consistent return (e.g., 20%), venture capital embraces the likelihood of many investments failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Required Skillset for Venture Capital

The [[characteristics_and_appeal_of_venture_capital_investing | characteristics and appeal of venture capital investing]] align with specific skill sets:

*   **[[longterm_qualitative_judgments_in_venture_capital | Long-term Qualitative Judgments]]**: Investors need to make qualitative judgments about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This involves imagining what a business could look like in 10 years if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, especially considering that current data is often insufficient for making a knowledge advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   **Optimism and Futurist Mindset**: An optimistic outlook is beneficial for visualizing a company's potential success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. This contrasts with a more conservative approach focused on avoiding losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Visualizing Future Value**: A key aspect is to visualize what a business could be worth if it succeeds, and the potential probability of that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. This includes anticipating future financials, competitive advantages ("moats"), required capital, and potential competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Founder-Centric Approach**: The process often involves a love for "hunting for Founders," working with them, and engaging with the broader business of venture investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

This approach contrasts with roles focused on highly quantitative skills and conservative personality traits, which might be better suited for areas like bond investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Finding an [[investment_and_venture_capital_insights | investment]] style that suits one's personal makeup is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

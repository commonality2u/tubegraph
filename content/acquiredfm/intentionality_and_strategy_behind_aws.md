There are multiple origin stories for [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon Web Services]] ([[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]]), all of which offer insights into [[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]] and [[amazons_business_strategy_and_competitive_dynamics | Amazon's culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Debunked "Excess Capacity" Narrative

The most commonly believed, yet untrue, origin story for [[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]] is the "excess capacity" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

The story posits that around 2001-2003, [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon.com]], as a retail business, experienced highly seasonal demand with huge traffic spikes in Q4 for the holiday shopping season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. To handle this peak demand, [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon]] had to build out significant technical infrastructure capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. The urban legend claims that during quarters one through three, this capacity sat idle, leading [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon]] to decide to rent it out to other developers, thus turning a large expense into a revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

### Why the Myth Falls Apart

This narrative is incorrect for several reasons:

*   **Technological Infeasibility**: In the pre-cloud era, technology companies' infrastructure was highly customized and tightly coupled to their applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Servers were not generic or easily shareable, nor was there adequate security or network hardware designed for multi-tenancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon.com]]'s codebase was installed on specific owned servers, like DEC Alpha servers, making it impossible to simply rent out excess capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:47">[03:32:47]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Evolution**: While the shift to Linux and commodity hardware (like HP servers) around 2000 did save [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon]] significant costs and contributed to preventing the company from going out of business, this was a move to a more open-source ecosystem, not a virtualization of cloud servers for external use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Business Model Contradiction**: If [[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]] operated on excess capacity, it could not reliably serve customers like Netflix, as [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon]] would theoretically reclaim the servers during its Q4 peak, making it an unsustainable model for critical services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

### Official Debunking

Werner Vogels, who was [[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]] CTO and is now the CTO of all of [[amazons_business_strategy_and_competitive_dynamics | Amazon]], explicitly stated in a 2011 Quora post that "the excess capacity story is a myth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:03">[06:03:03]</a>. He further clarified that [[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]] would have "already burned through the excess [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon.com]]" capacity within two months of its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

## Intentional Strategy and Investment

The "excess capacity" myth understates [[amazons_business_strategy_and_competitive_dynamics | Amazon's intentionality and strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:03">[06:49:03]</a>.

*   **[[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]] as a Standalone Business**: [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon Web Services]] was always considered a business unit in itself, with the expectation that it could grow to be as large as the [[amazon_web_services_aws | Amazon.com]] retail operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:49">[06:34:49]</a>.
*   **Technology as an Investment**: [[amazons_business_strategy_and_competitive_dynamics | Amazon]] never viewed technology as merely a cost center or an IT department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:21">[07:01:21]</a>. They consistently saw themselves as a technology company and looked at technology as an investment, planning for future compute capabilities enabled by advancements like Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:04">[07:10:04]</a>.
*   **Strategic Market Creation**: The creation of [[amazon_web_services_aws | AWS]] was an "incredibly intentional strategy" and a "brand new business school case study type laser focus on an emerging market" that [[amazons_business_strategy_and_competitive_dynamics | Amazon]] believed it could create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. This highlights [[awss_market_dynamics_and_strategic_approach | AWS's market dynamics and strategic approach]] from its inception.

From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Hermès, a luxury brand dating back to 1837, demonstrates a unique approach to business that intertwines craftsmanship, exclusivity, and a particular philosophy toward its products and people. While not explicitly using modern terminology like "sustainability," their practices inherently touch upon aspects of environmental and social responsibility, primarily through their focus on durability, repair, and artisan welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Craftsmanship and Durability

A foundational aspect of Hermès's ethos is its obsession with craft and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. Products are handmade by master artisans, often involving a single craftsman responsible for an entire piece, such as a Kelly bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. This dedication to [[Herms history and craftsmanship | traditional craftsmanship]] aims to create items that are durable and intended to last a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.

A key differentiator is Hermès's commitment to repairing its products, regardless of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:35">[03:31:35]</a>. They maintain 15 dedicated repair shops worldwide, mending approximately 120,000 pieces annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:38">[03:31:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:44">[03:31:44]</a>. This practice contrasts sharply with a disposable consumer culture, promoting longevity and valuing the "soul" imbued by a handmade object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:05">[03:33:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:10">[03:33:10]</a>.

> "This product has a soul. Somebody made that thing with their bare hands. That means something." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:10">[03:33:10]</a>

## Responsible Growth and Exclusivity

Hermès consciously chooses a path of "responsible growth," limiting production and prioritizing exclusivity over mass-market appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. Unlike other luxury brands that may pursue aggressive expansion, Hermès operates with a "rate-limited flywheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:26">[02:54:26]</a>. This means they intentionally constrain supply rather than maximizing sales, believing that rampant growth can diminish desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:47">[02:45:47]</a>.

Their pricing strategy, which sees annual increases of about 7% across the line, is also designed to maintain an elite image without being "egregious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:31">[02:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:46">[02:01:46]</a>. This contributes to their stability, even during periods of luxury market pullback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:52">[01:55:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>.

## Material Sourcing and Animal Welfare

Hermès faces scrutiny regarding its use of exotic leathers, such as those from farmed crocodiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:41">[03:48:41]</a>. In response to concerns, including a boycott by Jane Birkin, Hermès brought crocodile farming in-house to improve animal welfare standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:54">[03:48:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:01">[03:49:01]</a>. Their defense for exotic leathers is centered on sustainable farming, which includes releasing animals back into the wild to replenish populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:18">[03:49:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:36">[03:49:36]</a>.

For cowhide leathers, they argue that they utilize the entire animal, which was already being used for sustenance, minimizing waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:54">[03:49:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:08">[03:50:08]</a>. Despite the debate, Hermès has not committed to going vegan and continues to use traditional materials, unlike some other luxury brands that have banned exotic leathers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:52">[03:50:52]</a>.

## Waste Reduction: The Petite H Initiative

To address material waste, Hermès launched "Petite H" in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:58">[03:15:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:39">[03:16:39]</a>. This division uses leftover scraps of high-quality materials (leathers, felts, silks) that are too small or irregular for main products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:21">[03:16:21]</a>. Artists collaborate to create whimsical, smaller goods through a process called "creation in reverse," where designs are inspired by the available materials rather than conceived first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:02">[03:17:02]</a>.

However, a significant point of criticism is Hermès's practice of destroying imperfect products to maintain brand purity, ensuring no flawed items enter the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:05">[03:51:05]</a>. While they report efforts to become more efficient in manufacturing to reduce waste, the burning of products remains a concern for animal welfare advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:26">[03:51:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:38">[03:51:38]</a>.

## Employee Well-being and Skill Preservation

Hermès places a high value on its artisans, fostering a culture of long-term employment and skill transmission. They boast an incredibly low annual employee turnover rate of 6%, with only 4.5% leaving voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:56">[04:03:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:03">[04:04:03]</a>. This leads to an average tenure exceeding 20 years, a rate comparable to or better than companies like Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:13">[04:11:13]</a>.

To scale their unique handcrafted production model, Hermès has invested heavily in creating its own training pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:25">[02:46:25]</a>. They establish trade schools, often in rural French areas with high unemployment, to train master craftspeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:23">[02:48:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:31">[02:48:31]</a>. These schools have 100% graduation rates, guaranteeing job offers upon completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:38">[02:48:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:50">[02:48:50]</a>.

In 2021, Hermès opened its first official French government-sanctioned degree-granting program, the "École Hermès des savoir-faire," explicitly linking education with their "know-how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:25">[02:49:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:30">[02:49:30]</a>. This strategy not only ensures a continuous supply of skilled labor but also preserves a dying art form, reinforcing their claim of craftsmanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:48">[02:44:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:47">[02:49:47]</a>. The workforce has also evolved, with the average age of artisans being 30 years old and 80% being women, a significant shift from previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:16">[02:49:16]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations and Future Outlook

Hermès's commitment to its unique model creates tension. While their "not a museum" but also "not a factory" mantra guides their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:05">[02:47:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:09">[02:47:09]</a>, decisions like the Apple Watch partnership and the expansion into beauty products demonstrate a willingness to adapt to broader markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:17">[03:10:17]</a>. These ventures offer more accessible price points and are sometimes machine-sewn, which some perceive as a "mild violation of the brand promise" of handmade exclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:47">[03:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:27">[03:03:27]</a>.

The company's approach to [[Generational leadership and family dynamics at Herms | leadership]] and [[Challenges and strategies in maintaining luxury and exclusivity | brand positioning]] reflects a desire to balance tradition with market relevance. They avoid celebrity endorsements, relying instead on the inherent desirability of their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:02">[03:33:02]</a>. Celebrities often pay full price to wear Hermès, turning them into authentic, unpaid brand ambassadors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:54">[03:33:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:12">[03:34:12]</a>. This strategy, combined with their focus on artisans and product longevity, provides a counter-narrative to the fast-fashion, mass-production models prevalent in much of the industry.

The "dinner tradition" at Benchmark, held in a dining room on the 19th floor of their office, originated from an effort by Bill and Peter to introduce new practices and ideas into the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Origin of the Dinner Tradition
The inspiration for these dinners came from Bill's reading of [[entrepreneurship_lessons_from_biographies | Ben Franklin's biography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Franklin reportedly held four dinners a week, each dedicated to deep discussions on specific topics such as finance, chemistry, or life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This sparked the idea for Benchmark to host similar dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

An initial "playful experiment" with a big dinner in late 2006 or 2007, during Peter's first year, proved to be an amazing and "electric" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This first dinner included four outside guests: Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Fostering Curiosity and Learning
The concept behind these dinners is rooted in the belief that while firms often have strategies not connected to reality, a venture firm is fundamentally a "collection of habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Drawing on the ideas of William James, it is held that "we are nothing but an amalgamation of our habits," and habits shape character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

The dinner tradition serves as a habit to nurture curiosity, which is considered the "essential lifeblood of the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Unlike structured office meetings, these dinners offer "open-ended No Agenda wild explorations" of various topics that partners might be curious about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. They honor the firm's purpose of "constantly learning and activating our curiosity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> and create a "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved in one-on-one settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## The Unique Table Design
A challenge with traditional dining tables is that rectangular shapes can embed power structures, while circular tables tend to atomize the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. To address this, the firm uses a unique table designed by Ole Lundberg, inspired by Jean-Marie Masoud's "the seven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The design aims to be organic, capable of expanding and collapsing, and, crucially, to "deconstruct power centers" and create a "non-hierarchical construct with intimacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

This table's structure ensures that "everybody else can hear" any sidebar conversation, fostering "one conversation" among all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This "one conversation element" is seen as powerful because it keeps the entire group "tuned in on whatever's being discussed," regardless of whether it's good, bad, or tough news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the practice in some other venture firms where partners might pre-sell or have side conversations about topics before a main meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Esteemed Guests and Impact
These dinners frequently host esteemed guests beyond the firm's five partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The focus is on giving "the spotlight of attention" to the guest, often someone the firm has not worked with or invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Notable past guests include Dylan Field, Toby from Shopify, and Jeff Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. These interactions often leave the firm feeling "swept off your feet," reinforcing their purpose "to serve people like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. While the specific table is not portable, the firm has held similar gatherings in other locations like Seattle and Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

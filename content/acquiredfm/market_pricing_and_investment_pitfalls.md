One of the significant impediments to profitability in investment is rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Success requires open-mindedness and the continuous evolution of one's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Investment organizations often impose rules against buying bonds rated below A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, finding areas where "no one else was bidding" can often be a beneficial indicator for an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## High-Yield Bond Market Mispricing

Initially, the bond department at Citibank was considered a "backwater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. When asked to explore high-yield bonds, it was discovered that most [[investment_and_venture_capital_strategies | investment organizations]] had rules against buying low-rated bonds, typically below A or Triple B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Mike Milken, who also started his career in 1969, found interest in low-rated bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### The Hickman Study and Realized Returns

Milken reportedly discovered a book by Hickman, which analyzed bond performance from 1900 to around 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This study revealed that the lower a bond's rating, the higher its *actual* rate of return, not just its promised yield, but its realized total return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Despite defaults and bankruptcies, even during the Great Depression, the excess yield received from these bonds was more than sufficient to offset credit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This insight was an "aha moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

At the time, issuing a low-rated bond (called non-investment grade or speculative grade) was nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Major banks and underwriters avoided them, and Moody's manual even defined a B-rated bond as one that "fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The prevailing sentiment was that these bonds were "not proper for [[investment_and_venture_capital_strategies | investment]] regardless of price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Understanding Risk: The Life Insurance Analogy

The reluctance to invest in bonds with known default risks can be likened to the business model of life insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Life insurance companies successfully operate despite knowing that every policyholder will eventually die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This is because:
1.  **Risk Awareness**: Death is an expected event, not a shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
2.  **Risk Analyzability**: They can analyze the risk, often sending doctors to assess health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
3.  **Risk Diversification**: They diversify their book, not insuring only high-risk individuals like skydivers or smokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
4.  **Well-Compensated Risk**: They are well-paid to take the risk, pricing policies with a margin of safety, assuming a shorter lifespan than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

This approach applies directly to [[risks_and_rewards_of_investing_in_low_rated_bonds | high-yield bonds]]: while some are expected to default, the key is to ensure that the compensation for taking on that risk is adequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. By adopting this perspective, it became possible to "make money steadily and safely investing in the worst public companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## The Nifty Fifty and Overpricing Pitfalls

In contrast to high-yield bonds, Citibank's investment research department in 1969 focused on the "Nifty Fifty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. These were considered the "best and fastest growing companies in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, with the belief that "nothing bad could ever happen" and "there was no price too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This attitude stood in stark opposition to the perception of high-yield bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

However, both stances—"no price too high" for the Nifty Fifty and "no price low enough" for high-yield bonds—were incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Investors who bought the Nifty Fifty in 1969 and held for five years lost "almost all their money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This was primarily because they were "priced too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, with many selling at P/E ratios between 60 and 90, compared to the post-war S&P average of 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Examples of Nifty Fifty companies that faced significant challenges included:
*   **IBM**: While it didn't go bankrupt, it faced severe difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Xerox**: Lost its market share to imports and had to find a new business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Patterns**: A consumer company whose business model largely disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

The concept of [[role_of_economic_moats_in_company_valuation | disruption]] was not considered, and the [[role_of_economic_moats_in_company_valuation | economic moats]] of these companies were thought to be "inviolate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The simple thinking failed to account for competitive dynamics, such as foreign competitors pricing below established companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Many of these companies experienced losses exceeding 90% from their peak valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

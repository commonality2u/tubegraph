European dinners are characterized by their extended duration, typically lasting about three to three and a half hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The core purpose of these gatherings is social connection, which is viewed as fluid, fun, and playful, rather than transactional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Attendees are expected to leave the dinner "beaming" and "smiling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, contrasting with a typical rigid dinner structure that might have an agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Benchmarks Adoption of the Dinner Tradition

The tradition of dinners at Benchmark, inspired by Ben Franklin's biography, aimed to inject new practices and ideas into the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Franklin reportedly held four dinners a week, delving deeply into subjects like finance, chemistry, and life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. An initial large dinner experiment in 2006 or 2007 with four outside guests—Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos—was described as "electric," where "time stood still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The dinners serve as a habit to cultivate curiosity, which is considered the "essential lifeblood" of the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Unlike typical Monday meetings, which are limited, these dinners offer a broader dynamic range for open-ended, no-agenda, and "wild explorations of the most bizarre things" partners might be curious about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. They foster a "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved through one-on-one interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Table Design and Atmosphere
A unique aspect of Benchmark's dinners is the deliberate choice of a non-hierarchical table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Traditional rectangular tables can create a power structure, while circular tables may atomize the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The custom-designed table, which was created by Ole Lundberg based on a hand sketch, expands and collapses organically to deconstruct power centers and promote intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

This specific table design contributes to the firm's ethos by ensuring a single, collective conversation, preventing sidebars because everyone can hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional venture capital partner meetings where side conversations are often encouraged before bringing up a topic to the main group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. The objective is to keep everyone "tuned in" to whatever is being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.

The dinners are a space where partners can engage on topics beyond the daily business, fostering a sense of enjoyment in each other's company and building deeper relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This includes conversations on diverse and sometimes unexpected subjects, such as psychedelics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. This emphasis on genuine connection contributes to the overall [[The culture and dynamics of venture capital partnerships | culture and dynamics of their venture capital partnership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

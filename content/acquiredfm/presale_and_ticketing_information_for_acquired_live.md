## Presale Access

To ensure access to tickets, listeners are encouraged to sign up for presale access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Presale tickets will become available a few weeks before general public access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Given the significant growth of the Acquired listener base, particularly in New York and the Northeast Corridor, demand for tickets is expected to be high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The previous live show at [[acquireds_chase_center_event_details | Chase Center]] saw over 6,000 attendees, which is comparable to [[acquired_live_at_radio_city_music_hall | Radio City Music Hall]]'s 6,000-person capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

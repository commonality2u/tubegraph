The widespread adoption of self-driving cars has faced significant [[Future Trends and Challenges in AI Development | challenges]], evolving from early optimistic predictions to a more tempered reality. While 2014 was once anticipated as "the year of self-driving cars," the question persists in 2023: "is next year of the year?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>. This timeline remains an "unanswerable question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.

## Key Challenges

The primary hurdle for self-driving technology lies in addressing the "last two percent of use cases," often referred to as "tail use cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. The unknown effort required to overcome these remaining complexities makes the timeline unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:36">[01:20:36]</a>.

### Safety and Societal Acceptance
A significant philosophical challenge is determining "how safe does a robot have to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. In the United States, approximately 40,000 deaths annually result from car accidents, with highway accidents being a leading cause of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>.

Even if robot cars were 10 times safer, this would still translate to 4,000 deaths per year, or "a little more than 10 a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>. If they were 100 times safer, it would mean 400 fatalities annually, or "one every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a>. It is uncertain how society would react to such statistics, as humans are often more "forgiving" of mistakes made by other humans than by robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>.

Uber itself experienced an "unbelievably unfortunate circumstance in Phoenix" which led them to "completely re-design how we built for safety first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>.

## Uber's Strategic Shift

Due to the pandemic, Uber made the decision to "get out of self-driving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>. This was considered a sound decision, as Uber's core strength lies in building a "demand Network connecting...demand to supply in a dynamic way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>.

Instead of developing its own autonomous vehicles, Uber now partners with various companies in the autonomous space, including Waymo, Aurora, and Mobilize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>. This approach allows Uber to work within a "much larger ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a>.

### Hybrid Transition and Future Outlook
Despite the [[Challenges and strategies in ridesharing and food delivery | challenges]], small-scale self-driving experiments are growing, particularly visible in cities like San Francisco, where driverless cars are becoming commonplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

However, issues remain, such as robot cars being unable to double-park for pickups, unlike human drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>. The goal for Uber's ride-share service is a 98% "fulfill rate" (car availability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:11">[01:24:11]</a>. Maintaining this high level of coverage everywhere, regardless of conditions, is "really, really difficult" for any single provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>.

This reinforces Uber's strategy of working with partners like Waymo and Aurora to create a "hybrid transition state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>. This model would allow for "smart kind of switching layer," where a human or a robot picks up the passenger depending on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:59">[01:24:59]</a>.

While the transition will "take a while," it is indeed "happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>. The expectation is that autonomous vehicles will become a "material part of our Network or Transportation at large" in approximately "a good 10 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>.

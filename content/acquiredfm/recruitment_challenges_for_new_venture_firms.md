The process of recruiting partners for a new venture capital firm can present significant challenges, especially when proposing unconventional models. This was evident during the formation of [[Benchmark Venture Capital Firm | Benchmark Capital]], which aimed to establish an [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal partnership]] model.

## Initial Struggles and Skepticism

In early 1994, after the breakup of Technology Venture Investors (TVI), Bob Kagle, driven by an "almost religious fervor" for [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal partnership]], sought to start a new firm [03:14:00]. His initial attempt to recruit Bruce Dunleavy from Merrill Pickard, based on the idea of an [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal partnership]] and the emerging internet opportunity, was met with hesitation [09:56:00]. Bruce, being younger and without the financial cushion of Bob's earlier success with Microsoft, initially declined [10:22:00].

A few months later, internal discussions at Merrill Pickard about their next fund revealed a similar resistance to the [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal economics]] idea, mirroring the situation at TVI [10:33:00]. This prompted Bruce and his colleague Andy Ratcliffe to consider leaving Merrill Pickard [11:04:00].

Despite Bob's deep belief in the [[equal_partnership_in_venture_capital_firms | equal partnership]] model, early attempts to recruit partners outside of their immediate circle faced considerable skepticism [08:07:00].

Many established venture capitalists felt there was no reason to leave their current firms [00:14:35]. The conventional path for ambitious young professionals was to ascend within existing venerated Silicon Valley firms, as exemplified by John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins [00:14:21].

## The Need for Capacity and Credibility

Bruce Dunleavy, while amenable to starting a new firm, highlighted practical concerns about a two-person team [00:13:35]. He argued that just two partners would lack the necessary investment capacity to build a diversified portfolio [00:12:40]. They would not have enough companies if each managed eight to ten board seats, which was their preferred "TVI style" of engagement [00:13:00].

Beyond operational capacity, Bruce also noted a "credibility aspect" with Limited Partners (LPs), who would likely "start poking holes" in a firm with so few partners [00:13:20]. This pressure meant that even though they had "burned the boats" by leaving their previous firms, they still needed to recruit more partners [00:15:00].

## Recruiting Entrepreneurial Talent

Recognizing the difficulty in attracting traditional venture capitalists, Bruce suggested looking elsewhere, proposing that bringing "entrepreneurial DNA into the firm" could be beneficial [00:16:04]. This led to the recruitment of Kevin Harvey, a former entrepreneur who had founded two companies, one acquired by Apple and another sold to Lotus [00:16:26]. Kevin saw the opportunity as "way easier than starting another company" [00:16:48].

By the end of 1994, the founding team had solidified to include Bob Kagle, Bruce Dunleavy, Andy Ratcliffe, and Kevin Harvey [00:16:51]. They initially aimed for five partners, successfully recruiting Val Vaden, who had experience in software company buyouts [00:17:03]. These five individuals—Bob, Bruce, Andy, Kevin, and Val—became the founding members of what they audaciously named "Benchmark Capital," signaling their aspiration to "set a new Benchmark for performance in this industry" [00:18:03].

## Portrayal in "Super Pumped"
The Showtime series "Super Pumped," set to air on February 27th, chronicles the "insane story" of [[ubers_rise_and_ipo | Uber]] leading up to its [[ubers_rise_and_ipo | IPO]] and the subsequent implosion [01:06:06]. Joe Gordon-Levitt stars in the series, portraying Travis Kalanick, also referred to as TK [02:24:26]. The decision to portray such a controversial figure in entertainment and pop culture is noted as surreal [01:28:16].

## Character and Personality
Joe Gordon-Levitt describes Travis Kalanick as embodying an "animal instinct" that desires to take what it wants, disregarding consequences [01:10:59]. He notes that Travis "just goes as hard as he can into that... animal instinct" [01:10:59]. While much of what is publicly known about Kalanick involves "questionable decisions" and "unethical behavior," Gordon-Levitt sought to portray a "whole human" by speaking with people who worked closely with him [02:04:10]. These conversations revealed positive aspects such as Kalanick's inspiring and compelling nature, and the energy he brought to a room, which are not always evident in press articles or even Mike Isaac's book [02:10:43].

Brian Koppelman highlights Kalanick's ability to "enlist all these people in his world-changing vision" [01:10:59]. He notes that Kalanick needed to be portrayed as someone willing to "yell at them because they weren't super pumped" [01:10:59]. Kalanick is described as nothing "if not confident" [02:51:52].

## Business Philosophy and Impact
Travis Kalanick's leadership at [[ubers_rise_and_ipo | Uber]] is presented as an example of a business philosophy prioritizing "profits above all, shareholder value up before everything" [01:14:01]. This mentality, characterized by "growth growth growth" regardless of impact, is not exclusive to Silicon Valley but is exemplified by companies like [[ubers_rise_and_ipo | Uber]] [01:14:15].

The series explores the "question of disruption and the cost" [01:19:50]. It asks whether the benefits of a new utility or changing infrastructure are worth the consequences [01:22:24]. Kalanick's vision was to "will this thing into existence," changing the world where "all the cards were stacked against him" [03:03:00]. The show also touches on the idea of revolutionaries avoiding becoming "fascists" themselves after unseating them [01:46:00].

The series aims to serve as a cautionary tale, "shining light on the protagonist's shortcomings and dark moments" [02:51:52]. While some audience members might feel empathy for Kalanick or believe he was treated unfairly in certain "micro moments," the narrative's shifting perspective reveals the "emptiness" and "cost" associated with such an approach [02:51:52]. The show encourages viewers to consider "what it means to be that kind of guy" and the societal implications of "prop[ping] up people who have incredible verbal acuity and great math skills and the ability to galvanize" [02:51:52]. Ultimately, it seeks to foster empathy for individuals affected by this drive, such as mistreated office staff or drivers who faced unforeseen financial hardships [02:51:52].

## Kalanick's Role in Founding [[ubers_rise_and_ipo | Uber]]
One of the foundational myths surrounding [[ubers_rise_and_ipo | Uber]] involves Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp looking at the Eiffel Tower as inspiration [03:26:00]. The show "plays with this" narrative, initially presenting the "apocryphal story" before revealing "how it really happened," distinguishing fact from popular legend [03:32:00].

## Relationship with [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Bill Gurley]]
The series delves into the complex relationship between Kalanick and [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Bill Gurley]], portraying a significant "moral questions and life questions for TK" [01:36:00]. Koppelman notes that [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Bill Gurley]] faced a challenging decision regarding Kalanick's future at [[ubers_rise_and_ipo | Uber]] [01:36:00]. The show features a scene where Gurley reflects on founders, suggesting that while he once believed half were angels and half were "David Koresh," he later realized "they're all David Koresh" [03:09:00]. Brian Koppelman clarifies that for the series, he and the team worked solely from Mike Isaac's book, deliberately not incorporating any personal information gleaned from his friendship with [[case_studies_uber_lyft_youtube_apple_tsmc | Bill Gurley]] [01:59:00].# The Influence of Travis Kalanick

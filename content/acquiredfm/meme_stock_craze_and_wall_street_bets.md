The meme stock craze, notably involving GameStop, became a significant focus area for some members of the House Financial Services Committee, alongside topics like China and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The phenomenon was closely followed on the Wall Street Bets forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Legislative Attempts and Outcomes

Despite significant attention, there was disappointment regarding the lack of effective [[legislation_attempts_during_meme_stock_mania | legislation]] stemming from the meme stock mania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The committee held numerous hearings on the issue, totaling around four sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

One key proposed solution that could have been implemented in a bipartisan way was to shorten the settlement time for trades from two days (T+2) to one day (T+1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This change was believed to reduce overall systemic risk and potentially have prevented platforms like Robinhood from having to halt trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

However, rather than focusing on specific solutions like settlement time, a bill was passed by the House that incorporated various unrelated items that Democrats had wanted to achieve for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This bill did not advance in the Senate, resulting in no substantive changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This outcome is described as a "political casualty," typical of the frustrations experienced in Washington, D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Personal Engagement with Hearings

The hearings on meme stocks were particularly engaging and "fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. During remote sessions, committee members would monitor the Wall Street Bets forum on a separate computer while participating in the official hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This allowed real-time observation of public reactions, including instances where members were "eviscerated" by online commenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. One committee member was even humorously compared to "Hitman" from the video game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

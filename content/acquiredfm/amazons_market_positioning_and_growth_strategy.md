In a recent episode of the Acquired podcast, experts delved into Amazon's evolving strategy, revealing insights about its market position as well as recommendations for its growth.

In recent showcases of their strategies, Amazon has projected a movement from a high-growth startup to what they term as "day two," which involves transitioning to a more sustainable and profit-oriented company.

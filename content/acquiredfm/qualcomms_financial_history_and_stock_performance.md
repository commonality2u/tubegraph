[[Qualcomms history and strategic maneuvers | Qualcomm's financial trajectory]] reflects a remarkable journey, from early struggles to becoming a dominant force in the semiconductor and mobile technology licensing sectors.

## Early Growth and Initial Stock Performance (1995-1999)

In 1995, the first year CDMA networks went live in the U.S. and internationally, Qualcomm reported revenues of $383 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This figure nearly doubled to $814 million in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a>. Despite this rapid revenue growth, Wall Street initially viewed the stock unfavorably, with the stock price remaining "basically flat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:15">[01:42:15]</a> until January 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:15">[01:56:15]</a>. This negative sentiment stemmed from the significant capital required for the company's manufacturing operations and joint ventures, which "ty[ed] up all the profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:15">[01:53:15]</a> and led to the stock being "punished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:15">[01:55:15]</a>.

During this period, CDMA achieved significant market penetration, securing a 57% market share in the U.S. 2G market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>, 100% in countries like South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>, and a "massive market share in China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.

## Strategic Divestitures and Business Model Shift (1999)

Recognizing the drain of capital-intensive manufacturing operations, Qualcomm made pivotal [[Qualcomms strategic decisions and acquisitions | strategic decisions]] in 1999:
*   **March 1999**: Qualcomm sold its infrastructure business (base stations) to Ericsson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:15">[02:27:15]</a>. This transfer included approximately 1,000 of Qualcomm's 9,500 employees becoming Ericsson employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:15">[03:00:15]</a>.
*   **December 1999**: Qualcomm sold its mobile phone business to Kyocera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:15">[03:39:15]</a>.

These divestitures marked a significant shift towards a fabless model, focusing on two core business groups:
*   **Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Group (QTC)**: Specializing in selling chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:15">[03:48:15]</a>.
*   **Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)**: Managing high-margin revenue from licensing its [[Qualcomms patent strategy and economic impact | patent War chest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:15">[03:51:15]</a>.

This new model allowed Qualcomm to generate "relatively high margin semiconductor designs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:15">[04:13:15]</a> without the costs of fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:15">[04:18:15]</a>, and to charge a percentage of phone sales as licensing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:15">[04:24:15]</a>.

## Dot-Com Bubble Surge and Volatility (2000)

Following these strategic changes, Qualcomm's stock experienced an extraordinary surge during the height of the tech bubble. In the year 2000, Qualcomm was the single best-performing stock, appreciating by 2621% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:15">[06:01:15]</a>. However, this parabolic rise was followed by a sharp correction, with the stock crashing over the next 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:15">[06:40:15]</a>, ultimately settling at approximately 4x its pre-1999 high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:15">[06:47:15]</a>.

## 3G Dominance and Strategic Acquisitions (2000s)

The transition to 3G networks proved highly beneficial for Qualcomm. While early debates existed between GSM and CDMA standards, nearly "all 3G was CDMA" worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:15">[07:35:15]</a>. This dominance was attributed to CDMA's "vastly superior technology" for broadband internet data speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:15">[07:44:15]</a>, as it was optimized for digital information transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:15">[08:04:15]</a>.

In 2005, Qualcomm acquired Flarian Technologies for $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:15">[08:50:15]</a>. This acquisition was primarily to secure essential patents for 4G technologies like OFDMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:15">[09:01:15]</a>, allowing Qualcomm to continue its business model of licensing required patents for future generations of wireless technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:15">[09:56:15]</a>.

## The Paul Jacobs Era and Modern Dominance (2005-Present)

During Paul Jacobs' tenure as CEO (2005-2013/14) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:15">[10:06:15]</a>, while early strategic initiatives like IoT didn't immediately materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:15">[10:21:15]</a>, two key developments solidified Qualcomm's financial future:
1.  The Flarian acquisition, which enabled Qualcomm to pivot and embrace OFDMA for 4G, despite initial resistance to move beyond CDMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:15">[10:41:15]</a>.
2.  The development of the [[Impact and evolution of Qualcomms Snapdragon technology | Snapdragon]] line of mobile systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:15">[10:58:15]</a>. Snapdragon chips became the standard for high-end Android phones, similar to Apple's A-series chips for iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:15">[11:15:15]</a>.

Currently, Qualcomm's total annual revenue is close to $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, with 85% of that attributed to its [[Semiconductor industry dynamics | semiconductor business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The company is recognized as the "largest fabless Semiconductor Company in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>, surpassing Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Qualcomm earns "about twenty dollars for every smartphone sold in the world," including Apple iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:15">[12:09:15]</a>. From 2009 onwards, Qualcomm began to be perceived by customers and the media as "value capture pioneers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:15">[12:49:15]</a> due to their assertive patent licensing practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:15">[04:37:15]</a>.

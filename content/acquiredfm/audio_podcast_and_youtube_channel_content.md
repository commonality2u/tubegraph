## Introduction to Acquired

Acquired is a [[podcast_production_and_content_creation | podcast]] hosted by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, who describe themselves as "obsessed" with the history, strategy, and stories behind significant technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

The hosts conduct extensive research for each episode, dedicating over 100 hours to reading everything written about a company and watching all available videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. They then narrate the entire story of these companies, including prominent names like Nvidia, Sony, TSMC, and Amazon, which have shaped the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The show aims to provide "the absolute deepest longest and best technology stories on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While primarily focused on technology, Acquired occasionally covers non-tech subjects such as Berkshire Hathaway, the NFL, or even Taylor Swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## YouTube Channel Content

The Acquired YouTube channel features video recordings of select episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. These typically include episodes where the hosts sit down in person to interview guests, such as Brad Gerstner from Altimeter or Michael Ovitz, founder of CAA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A notable example captured on video is a dinner with all five Benchmark Partners, described as an "amazing life experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Given that many of the main Acquired episodes can be three or even four hours long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, the channel also produces "Acquired Stories." These are shorter, "bite-sized" segments, approximately 15 minutes in length, derived from the longer episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Primary Format: Audio Podcast

Despite their presence on YouTube, Acquired is primarily an audio [[podcast_production_and_content_creation | podcast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. YouTube subscribers constitute only about two percent of their total audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While the video content is "great," it is not the main focus of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

For the complete Acquired experience, including all episodes beyond just the video ones, listeners are directed to the audio version available on platforms such as Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or any preferred [[podcast_production_and_content_creation | podcast]] player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

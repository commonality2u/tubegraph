Qualcomm's journey to becoming a dominant force in the mobile semiconductor industry is marked by strategic shifts and the development of key technologies like Snapdragon. While the company's early success was rooted in its [[Founding of Qualcomm and contributions to the wireless industry | CDMA technology]] and [[Qualcomms patent strategy and economic impact | licensing model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, the advent of smartphones led to the critical development of Snapdragon.

## Early Strategic Shifts and Market Dominance

Qualcomm's total annual revenue is close to $40 billion, with 85% attributed to its semiconductor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This represents about $37 billion of their $44 billion revenue coming from chip sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Qualcomm is recognized as the largest fabless semiconductor company globally, surpassing Nvidia, which ranks second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

In 1999, Qualcomm made a significant [[Qualcomms strategic decisions and acquisitions | strategic decision]] to divest its capital-intensive manufacturing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. In March 1999, they sold their infrastructure (base stations) business to Ericsson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, and in December 1999, their mobile phone business to Kyocera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This allowed them to focus on two core high-margin business groups: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Group (QTC), which designs silicon, and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL), which manages their extensive patent portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

This shift proved immensely successful. In the year 2000, during the height of the tech bubble, Qualcomm's stock was the single best-performing stock of the entire year, appreciating by an astounding 2621% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

## Transition to 3G and 4G Standards

The adoption of CDMA as a major 2G standard contributed significantly to Qualcomm's growth, securing a 57% market share in the US and 100% in countries like South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

By the 3G era, virtually all networks, including those that initially adopted GSM, transitioned to CDMA or its derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This was because CDMA was vastly superior for broadband internet data speeds, as it natively handled digital information and packets, which became crucial for services like downloading websites or sending messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

In 2005, Irwin Jacobs retired as CEO and was succeeded by his son, Paul Jacobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. That same year, Qualcomm acquired Flarion Technologies for $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. Flarion held patents essential for 4G technologies, specifically OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access), which became the basis for 4G instead of CDMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. This acquisition allowed Qualcomm to maintain its [[Qualcomms patent strategy and economic impact | patent licensing model]] for the next generation of wireless technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

## The Birth and Impact of Snapdragon

During Paul Jacobs' tenure as CEO (2005-2013/14), which is often viewed with mixed opinions due to an early focus on IoT that didn't immediately materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>, two significant developments occurred:
*   **Pivot to OFDMA**: After initially resisting OFDMA and trying to push CDMA for 4G, Qualcomm pivoted to embrace OFDMA, thanks in part to the Flarion acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
*   **Development of Snapdragon**: Qualcomm began building the Snapdragon line of mobile systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. These SoCs integrated more processing power for the early predecessors to smartphones, positioning Qualcomm exceptionally well for the modern smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

Today, Snapdragon chips are the standard for high-end Android phones, much like Apple's A-series chips are for iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. Qualcomm has also broadly branded many of its components, including RF antennas, with the "Snapdragon" label, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of their silicon engineering and chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. This differentiated work is incredibly complex and vital to mobile technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

Currently, Qualcomm earns approximately $20 on average for every smartphone sold worldwide, including Apple iPhones, highlighting the pervasive impact of its technology and licensing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

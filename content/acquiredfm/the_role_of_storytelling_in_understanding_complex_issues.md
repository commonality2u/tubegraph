From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Storytelling plays a crucial role in dissecting and understanding complex issues, particularly those arising from the intersection of technology, business, and human nature. Podcasts like "Acquired" delve into the [[acquired_stories_and_podcast_formats | stories and playbooks]] behind great technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The Showtime series *Super Pumped*, which dramatizes the story of Uber, serves as a prime example of how narrative can bring complex business events into popular culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Defining Storytelling's Purpose

For artists, the purpose of storytelling is often to evoke feeling and ask questions, rather than to provide definitive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. This contrasts with roles in business, where the goal is typically to create value for customers and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Storytelling offers a unique lens through which to explore profound societal questions and human dilemmas.

## *Super Pumped* as a Case Study

The creation of *Super Pumped*, based on Mike Isaac's book, exemplifies how real-world events are transformed into compelling narratives. The series focuses on the turbulent history of Uber and its co-founder, [[leadership_insights_in_tech_companies | Travis Kalanick]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Thematic Resonance and Key Questions
The show was compelled by questions surrounding disruption and its true cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. It asks whether the benefits of new utility and convenience are worth what's lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, and if revolutionaries can avoid becoming like those they unseated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], who plays Kalanick, highlights the show's examination of a "profits above all" mentality, which he views as a dangerous trend in modern culture, especially in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### Portraying Complex Characters
Actors face the challenge of portraying complex figures who may be unlikable or morally questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] conducted extensive research, talking to people who worked closely with [[Travis Kalanick]] to understand his personality beyond media headlines, seeking to portray a "whole human" with both positive and negative traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. This approach allows the audience to initially love the character, only to be confronted with their seemingly terrible actions, creating a compelling [[detailed_storytelling_in_podcast_episodes | complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

[[Brian Koppelman]], a showrunner, noted the challenge of finding actors who can project intelligence and willingness to embody unsavory actions, essential for portraying Kalanick's ability to "enlist all these people in his world-changing vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### The Role of VCs in the Narrative
The series also features prominent figures like venture capitalist [[complexity_investing_principles | Bill Gurley]] as a primary character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This inclusion highlights the fascination with individuals who "put it all on the line" and make high-stakes decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Gurley's storyline explores his challenging moral dilemma: protecting his reputation among founders versus engineering Kalanick's removal to safeguard the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## The Interplay of Art and Business

The relationship between art and business in storytelling is complex. While business aims to provide answers and create value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>, art seeks to make people feel and ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. However, there's a continuum where figures like [[Aggregation Theory and its implications | Mark Andreessen]], initially an "artist" changing the world with Mosaic, transition into becoming "incredible business person[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. This shift in priorities, from artistic vision to business imperatives, is a recurring theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

Garrett Camp, a co-founder of Uber, is described as an "artist" within the company's story, more interested in the "fun and art" of his other projects like StumbleUpon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. His need for "Medici" (investors and workers) to realize his vision reflects how artistic endeavors often rely on business structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

### [[Art and business in technology storytelling | Art and business in technology storytelling]]
The *Super Pumped* creators leveraged the story's theme of "disruption" to "disrupt form" in their narrative approach, moving beyond conventional filmmaking to explore complex themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. This includes non-mainstream techniques, such as showing characters' apocryphal memories before revealing the actual events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. This innovation off the source material acknowledges the different experiences of reading a book versus watching a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

## The Impact and Reception of Stories

A key concern for creators is whether their work, particularly when portraying controversial figures, glorifies problematic behavior or serves as a cautionary tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. While some audience members might be inspired to mimic negative traits, the hope is that by unflinchingly showing the protagonist's shortcomings, the majority will perceive it as a cautionary tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

The creators believe that over time, the "emptiness" and "cost" associated with such characters become clear, similar to how audiences eventually understand that *The Wolf of Wall Street* isn't glorifying Jordan Belfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. The aim is to shed light on the societal implications of "propping up" individuals with "incredible verbal acuity and great math skills" who prioritize individual gain over societal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. This ultimately encourages empathy for those negatively impacted by such actions, like mistreated office workers or drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

## The Artist's Ethos

For artists, genuine curiosity is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. The creative process is driven by internal compulsion, not external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. Despite external pressures and potential failures (e.g., a movie bombing at the box office), the core commitment remains to the craft and to working with rigor and full heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>. The enduring value lies in the intrinsic satisfaction of achieving what was set out to create with collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. This aligns with Ralph Waldo Emerson's concept of self-reliance, suggesting that if one gives voice to what is innermost and authentic, it will resonate with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

[[Amazons investment in machine learning | Machine learning]] (ML) has become a significant pillar of [[Amazons business strategy and competitive dynamics | Amazon's business strategy]], particularly within [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While compute is a massive part of the business, and databases are crucial for customer stickiness, [[Amazons investment in machine learning | machine learning]] is rapidly gaining prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Investment in Machine Learning Offerings

[[Amazons investment in machine learning | Amazon's investment in machine learning]] is evident through several initiatives:
*   **SageMaker** The company has announced and heavily promoted SageMaker, their flagship ML service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Keynotes** Reflecting its importance, [[Amazons investment in machine learning | machine learning]] now has its own custom keynote presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Cloud-Hosted Offerings** [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] provides a comprehensive suite of cloud-hosted ML services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Framework Support** They support popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow, even though it was developed by [[comparison_of_amazon_and_google_ml_capabilities | Google]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Container Services** [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] offers its own custom Amazon Container Service (ECS) while also providing an Elastic Kubernetes Service to meet customer demand for Kubernetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The strategic aim is to encourage customers to adopt their proprietary ECS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Strategic Link: Data Storage and Machine Learning

The core of [[Amazons business strategy and competitive dynamics | Amazon's machine learning strategy]] revolves around data gravity:
*   [[Amazons investment in machine learning | Amazon's machine learning capabilities]] do not necessarily need to surpass [[comparison_of_amazon_and_google_ml_capabilities | Google's]] in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   The primary strategy is to ensure ML services are available where customer data resides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Running [[Amazons investment in machine learning | machine learning]] processing near the data is considered the most crucial factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Once a customer selects [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] as their primary storage vendor and migrates significant data to their data centers, they are unlikely to seek alternative providers for ML processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Instead, they will run their ML workloads on [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

While [[Amazon Web Services AWS | AWS]] cannot afford to fall significantly behind in ML capabilities, this strategy means that even if [[comparison_of_amazon_and_google_ml_capabilities | Google]] possesses superior ML offerings, it may not matter if customers are not storing their data with [[comparison_of_amazon_and_google_ml_capabilities | Google]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This highlights the critical competitive advantage of being the primary data storage provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Microsoft, founded in 1975, was the company that created the software business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. Today, it is the world's most valuable company, worth over $3 trillion, with 49 years of history in software and hardware development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>. This article explores the leadership and strategic decisions of its co-founder, [[Bill Gates on datadriven decision making | Bill Gates]], during Microsoft's foundational and growth years, establishing it as the dominant force in the PC era.

## Early Life and Influences

[[Bill Gates on datadriven decision making | Bill Gates]] III, also known as Trey, was born in Seattle, Washington, in 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:29">[03:38:29]</a>. His father, Bill Gates Senior, was a prominent attorney and a co-founding partner of Preston Gates and Ellis (now K&L Gates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:26">[06:26:26]</a>. His mother, Mary Maxwell, came from a successful business family and became one of the most powerful business figures in the Pacific Northwest through her involvement on various corporate and non-profit boards, including First Interstate Bank and the National United Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:50">[04:49:50]</a>.

Growing up, Gates was exposed to business conversations nightly, often with CEOs, senators, or governors at dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:40">[07:40:40]</a>. He was intensely competitive in all aspects of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:14">[08:35:14]</a>. At age 13, with his best friend [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Paul Allen]], Gates pondered what company he would lead and what industry he would tackle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:07">[08:10:07]</a>.

In 1968, at Lakeside School, Gates gained access to a DEC PDP-10 minicomputer, which was incredibly rare for a secondary school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This early exposure to computing, along with the mentorship of figures like Steve Russell (creator of Space War), allowed Gates and Allen to become prolific programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:30">[24:19:30]</a>. They formed the Lakeside Programmers Group, aiming to monetize their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:59">[20:26:59]</a>. Their first business venture, Traf-O-Data, involved building a machine with an Intel 8008 microprocessor to analyze traffic data, earning them at least $10,000 in royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of Microsoft's Vision

A pivotal moment occurred when [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Paul Allen]] observed that semiconductor improvements would lead to exponential increases in computing power, akin to [[Jensen Huangs leadership and strategic decisions | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:06">[30:44:06]</a>. Gates, initially surprised by this "exponential phenomena," quickly grasped its profound implications: computing could become virtually "free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:83">[30:54:83]</a>. This insight led to the vision of "a computer on every desk and in every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>, a seemingly "whackadoo" idea at a time when computers were massive, expensive machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>. This moment marked Gates's commitment to computers as his life's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>.

## The Mits Deal and Business Model Innovation

The emergence of the Altair 8800, the "world's first real, honest-to-God, commercially available for-sale microcomputer," in Popular Electronics magazine spurred Gates and Allen into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>. They famously called Mits, the Altair's manufacturer, falsely claiming to have a BASIC interpreter ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:00">[42:00:00]</a>. Ed Roberts, Mits's president, challenged them to demonstrate a working version in Albuquerque, New Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:31:00">[42:31:00]</a>. [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Paul Allen]] flew out with a handwritten bootloader written on the plane, and the BASIC interpreter worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31:00">[45:31:00]</a>.

Gates and Allen formed "Micro-soft" (later Microsoft) as a two-person partnership on April 4, 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:17:00">[52:17:00]</a>. Gates held 60% ownership, later increasing to 64% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:58:00">[53:58:00]</a>. Their initial deal with Mits was an exclusive licensing arrangement for the BASIC interpreter, capping Microsoft's lifetime revenue at $180,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:37:00">[55:37:00]</a>. This period saw the emergence of software piracy, as only a few hundred copies of BASIC sold monthly despite thousands of Altairs being shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:34:00">[58:34:00]</a>.

Gates recognized that the exclusive deal and per-copy sales model were flawed. The key was to shift to an OEM licensing model where hardware manufacturers would pre-install Microsoft's software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>. This would eliminate piracy concerns by embedding the software cost into the hardware price and make Microsoft the standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

## The IBM Partnership: A Masterstroke

The 1977 "Trinity" of personal computers (RadioShack TRS-80, Commodore PET, and Apple II) "ignited volume in the market," validating Gates's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Mits's failure to commercialize Microsoft's BASIC broadly led to an arbitration win for Microsoft in late 1977, freeing them to license BASIC to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>. Gates prioritized establishing Microsoft's BASIC as the industry standard by offering attractive, low fixed-cost deals (e.g., $31,000 for 8 years to Apple for the Apple II) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>. This strategy aimed to create a "positive spiral" where broad adoption would lead to dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.

In 1980, [[Microsofts partnership and eventual competition with IBM | IBM]], the world's most valuable company at the time, decided to enter the PC market with Project Chess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>. Their strategy was to build the IBM PC using off-the-shelf components and ship it within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. For software, [[Microsofts partnership and eventual competition with IBM | IBM]] approached Microsoft for programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>. Gates initially referred them to Digital Research for an operating system (CP/M), but negotiations failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.

Microsoft then acquired the rights to QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) from Seattle Computer Products for $75,000, which they adapted into MS-DOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>. The landmark deal with [[Microsofts partnership and eventual competition with IBM | IBM]] in November 1980 involved a fixed payment of $430,000 for DOS and other languages, with *no ongoing royalties* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:04">[01:49:04]</a>. Crucially, Microsoft retained the rights to license DOS to *anyone else* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">[01:50:04]</a>.

This decision was a "master stroke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:21">[01:48:21]</a>. Gates bet that the PC market would foster numerous hardware manufacturers ("clones") using the same components. [[Microsofts partnership and eventual competition with IBM | IBM]], assuming they would dominate the market, inadvertently handed control of the software ecosystem to Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:31">[01:52:31]</a>. As the IBM PC became a massive success (selling 500,000 units in two years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:18">[01:55:18]</a>, and clones like Compaq emerged by reverse-engineering the BIOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, Microsoft licensed DOS to all of them on a *per-machine sold* basis, leading to explosive revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:12">[02:01:12]</a>. Microsoft's revenue soared from $25 million in 1982 to $98 million by mid-1984, mostly from these high-margin software licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:10">[02:02:10]</a>.

## Diversification and Hedging Bets

Despite DOS's success, Gates and Microsoft continued to hedge their bets. They established a "consumer products division" in the early 1980s to develop application software, recruiting [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Charles Simonyi]] from Xerox PARC in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>. Xerox PARC was a hotbed of innovation, inventing the graphical user interface (GUI), mouse, object-oriented programming, and Ethernet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:37">[02:16:37]</a>. While [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Steve Jobs]] famously visited, Microsoft also extensively leveraged PARC's ideas, leading to the creation of Word and Multiplan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:20">[02:16:20]</a>.

When Lotus 1-2-3, a spreadsheet developed exclusively for the IBM PC, quickly surpassed Microsoft's Multiplan, Microsoft learned a crucial lesson: "never leave yourself open to the next generation of technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:50">[02:20:50]</a>. This meant always targeting the next platform, even if it wasn't their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>. This led to Microsoft developing Excel as the world's first graphical spreadsheet program specifically for the Apple Macintosh, which debuted in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Apple heavily promoted Excel as a "killer app" for the Mac, even matching Microsoft's marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

Concurrently, Microsoft was also developing its own graphical user interface, Windows, announced in November 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:13">[02:36:13]</a>. Early versions like Windows 1.0 (1985) were basic, tiled interfaces running on top of DOS, not a full operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:40">[02:39:40]</a>. Apple even licensed its GUI intellectual property to Microsoft for Windows 1.0 and "all future versions," a decision that would later prove costly for Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:01">[02:39:01]</a>.

## The Breakup with IBM and Windows 95

Meanwhile, [[Microsofts partnership and eventual competition with IBM | IBM]] sought to regain control of the PC ecosystem by developing a new, proprietary operating system called OS/2, in partnership with Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Microsoft, led by [[Microsoft Volume II  The Ballmer Years | Steve Ballmer]] (who joined in 1980) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:18">[01:35:18]</a>, felt compelled to "ride the bear" (IBM), as [[Microsoft Volume II  The Ballmer Years | Ballmer]] put it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:40">[02:43:40]</a>. However, IBM's decision to use the less powerful Intel 286 chip for its PC/AT, to prevent PCs from encroaching on Mainframe territory, opened the door for clones to adopt the more powerful 386 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

By late 1988, as OS/2 struggled, Microsoft began to pull away. The hiring of Mike Maples from [[Microsofts partnership and eventual competition with IBM | IBM]] to lead Microsoft's application software signaled a strategic shift towards the GUI-centric future [[Microsofts Enterprise Transformation | IBM]] was resisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:11">[02:48:11]</a>. The "divorce" between Microsoft and [[Microsofts partnership and eventual competition with IBM | IBM]] became official by the end of 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:01">[03:07:01]</a>.

The pivotal moment arrived with the launch of Windows 3.0 in 1990. This version, offering true multitasking and a better GUI experience on 386/486 machines, was a runaway success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Gates's internal memo declared: "Our strategy is Windows: one evolving architecture, a couple of implementations, and an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The initial Windows team was a "ragtag group" of about 65 people, a Plan B that unexpectedly became Plan A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a>.

In 1992, Microsoft won Apple's copyright lawsuit over the GUI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:19">[02:53:19]</a>. By January 1993, Microsoft surpassed [[Microsofts partnership and eventual competition with IBM | IBM]] in market capitalization, effectively inheriting the computing throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:41">[02:55:41]</a>. This shift empowered Microsoft to focus on becoming a platform steward, investing heavily in developer relations and encouraging OEMs to pre-install Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:12">[02:57:12]</a>.

The culmination of this era was the launch of Windows 95 on August 24, 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:05">[03:18:05]</a>. It was a massive global marketing event, drawing comparisons to a movie or music album launch, with Microsoft famously licensing "Start Me Up" by The Rolling Stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:14">[03:19:14]</a>. The product, designed for the "everyman," simplified the user experience with features like the Start menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Windows 95 sold 1 million copies in its first week and 7 million in its first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:46">[03:26:46]</a>. By fiscal 1997, Microsoft's revenue hit $12 billion, becoming the first software company to pass $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>.

## Strategic Learnings

*   **Capital Efficiency & Founder Control**: Microsoft's early capital efficiency allowed Gates and Allen to retain significant ownership, giving them unprecedented control over the company's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:04">[03:32:04]</a>. The low fixed costs of early software development, combined with the zero marginal cost of software, created a highly defensible business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Secular Growth**: Microsoft benefited immensely from the explosive growth of the PC market, which saw a 98% compound annual growth rate from 1975 to 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:12">[03:39:12]</a>.
*   **Hedging Bets and Flexibility**: Gates and Microsoft were masters of hedging, not putting all their eggs in one basket (e.g., developing Windows while committed to OS/2 with [[Microsofts partnership and eventual competition with IBM | IBM]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:39">[03:40:39]</a>. This flexibility allowed them to adapt quickly to changing market dynamics and capitalize on emerging opportunities.
*   **Platform Strategy and Network Effects**: Microsoft understood the power of being the "lynchpin" of the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. By allowing OEMs to build on their software and creating an attractive platform for developers, they fostered powerful network effects, incentivizing more users and applications to join their ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:07">[03:59:07]</a>. Document formats also created significant network economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:31">[03:59:31]</a>.
*   **Internationalization from Day One**: Going global early (with half of revenue from Japan by 1979) forced Microsoft to design products for worldwide adoption, providing a massive scale advantage for amortizing development costs and building a global brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. Their decentralized subsidiary model for sales and marketing ensured local relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:26">[03:49:26]</a>.
*   **Strategic Copying and Iteration**: Microsoft was not afraid to adopt and improve upon ideas from competitors, often waiting for others to prove a market before entering with a superior, more polished version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:31">[03:50:31]</a>. Their first versions of software were often not great, but subsequent versions were world-class, demonstrating a commitment to continuous learning and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:55">[03:52:55]</a>.
*   **Software is Never Done**: Unlike many competitors who treated software as a finished product upon shipment, Microsoft embraced the idea of continuous development, constantly improving and evolving their offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:50">[03:53:50]</a>.
*   **Talent Magnet**: Microsoft attracted ambitious young talent across all disciplines, fostering a culture where employees felt personally responsible for the product and were willing to work intensely to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:59">[03:45:59]</a>.

## Power

Microsoft's growth from 1975 to 1995 demonstrated nearly all of Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers:

*   **Counter Positioning**: Microsoft's willingness to embrace the fragmented PC market and operate purely on a software model, without the baggage of existing hardware businesses, allowed them to outmaneuver incumbents like [[Microsofts partnership and eventual competition with IBM | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:11">[03:56:11]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies**: The ability to develop software once and distribute it to millions of users at near-zero marginal cost, amortizing R&D over an enormous customer base, provided immense cost advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:46">[03:57:46]</a>.
*   **Switching Costs**: Once users and businesses adopted Microsoft's operating systems and applications, the cost and effort of switching to alternatives (due to file format compatibility, training, and integration) became prohibitively high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:29">[03:58:29]</a>.
*   **Network Economies**: A self-reinforcing cycle emerged where more Windows users attracted more application developers, leading to more software for Windows, which in turn attracted even more users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:07">[03:59:07]</a>. Document formats further strengthened this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:31">[03:59:31]</a>.
*   **Process Power**: While perhaps weaker in the very early days, Microsoft developed robust processes for product development, learning from customer feedback, and iterating rapidly, leading to consistently improved products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Branding**: By 1995, Microsoft and Windows became synonymous with personal computing. The Windows 95 launch was a masterclass in mass marketing, elevating the brand to a household name globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:57">[03:20:57]</a>.
*   **Cornered Resource**: [[Bill Gates on datadriven decision making | Bill Gates]]'s and [[History of Microsoft from founding through Windows 95 | Paul Allen]]'s unique early experience and vision for the software industry, combined with their ability to attract top talent, acted as a cornered resource in the nascent computing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:37">[03:34:37]</a>.

By 1995, Microsoft had become a formidable force, poised to navigate the next wave of technology and further solidify its position as a global leader.

Benchmark Capital is a prominent venture capital firm renowned for its unique approach to investing and firm structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>. Unlike many contemporaries, Benchmark famously believes that [[Venture capital strategies and firm architecture | venture capital doesn't scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. They have intentionally avoided growing their fund size, employing junior partners, or building platform teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:06">[02:01:06]</a>.

## The Venture Capital Landscape in the 1990s

In the early 1990s Silicon Valley, the venture capital ecosystem was significantly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. The dominant force was Kleiner Perkins, particularly through John Doerr, who was considered the "800-pound gorilla" of VC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Doerr had a highly centralized style, acting as the firm's CEO and lead investor, aggressively pursuing deals and sometimes attempting to pass off board seats to junior partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>. Kleiner Perkins also adopted a "modern Keiretsu" model, facilitating partnerships and business development relationships among their portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. Distribution deals were more crucial in the early internet era, as organic product-market fit was less direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.

Other notable firms included Sequoia (which hadn't yet achieved its current dominance), Greylock, Venrock (the venture arm of the Rockefeller family), and early institutional firms like IVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>. Technology Venture Investors (TVI) and Merrill Pickard Anderson and Eyre were two other firms, notably sharing an office building on Sand Hill Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. TVI gained prestige from being the sole venture capital investor in Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>, while Merrill Pickard had successful investments in companies like Palm Pilot and Rambus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>.

A common structure in venture firms at the time was for founding partners to own the management company, which controlled fees and governance, while junior partners only received portions of the fund's carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. This often led to resentment among younger partners who felt they weren't equitably rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:04">[01:23:04]</a>.

## The Founding of Benchmark Capital (1994)

The seeds of Benchmark were sown from this dissatisfaction with traditional firm structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.

### The Spark of Equal Partnership
Bob Kagle, a partner at TVI and a Stanford Business School alumnus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, was a strong advocate for an "equal partnership" model in venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>. He believed that anything other than equal economics was "morally wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>. As discussions within TVI about future structure stalled, the senior partners decided to "declare victory" and cease raising new funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>.

Similarly, at Merrill Pickard, younger partners Bruce Dunlevie (also a Stanford GSB alum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:03">[01:31:03]</a>) and Andy Rachleff faced similar resistance to equitable structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

In early 1994, Kagle approached Dunlevie with the idea of starting a new firm based on equal partnership, recognizing the nascent internet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>. Dunlevie initially hesitated due to financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>, but later, along with Rachleff, decided to pursue the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>.

### Formation and Philosophy
The founding team came together: Bob Kagle, Bruce Dunlevie, Andy Rachleff, and Kevin Harvey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:08">[01:39:08]</a> (an entrepreneur who previously started companies acquired by Apple and Lotus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:45">[01:38:45]</a>). They initially aimed for five partners, recruiting Val Vaden, who specialized in software company buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:18">[01:39:18]</a>.

They named their firm "Benchmark Capital," an audacious name reflecting their aspiration to set a new standard for venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. Their fund prospectus stated, "There is always room at the top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:55">[01:40:55]</a>.

In defiance of the prevailing trend of declining fees, Benchmark proposed a 30% carry, a premium over the standard 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>. This was a bold move from an unproven firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>. While some LPs (like Horsley Bridge) embraced this, others, notably Stanford University, actively lobbied against it, blackballing Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:21">[01:47:21]</a>. Stanford, an alma mater to many of Benchmark's founders, eventually invested in future funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:06">[01:48:06]</a>.

The founders' commitment to an equal partnership was partly inspired by Jim Collins' book *Built to Last*, which they even provided to prospective LPs as "brilliant marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:01">[01:49:01]</a>. Fund One ultimately closed at $85 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Turning Point (1995-1997)

The initial period after raising Fund One was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. The firm struggled to gel as a team, and some notable opportunities, like Amazon and Yahoo, were missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. Val Vaden, whose buyout background didn't align with Benchmark's early-stage technology focus, left the firm by the end of 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.

To inject "swagger" back into the firm, the remaining four partners (Kagle, Dunlevie, Rachleff, Harvey) recruited David Beirne, a highly competitive executive recruiter known for placing CEOs at top Silicon Valley companies like Netscape and Excite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. Beirne's recruitment was a significant turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.

### Key Investments of Fund One

*   **Webvan**: Beirne's first major deal was Webvan, an ambitious online grocery and general merchandise delivery service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Despite its later reputation as a dot-com bust, Benchmark's $3.5 million investment (split with Sequoia) was considered a smart, high-risk, high-upside bet at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Webvan's market cap peaked at $8 billion, a substantial return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

*   **eBoys**: Benchmark took the bold step of allowing author Randall Stross unprecedented access to their firm for his book *eBoys*, published in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. This provided an "inside account of venture capitalists at work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.

*   [[Benchmark Capitals investment in eBay | eBay]]: The defining investment of Fund One was in [[Benchmark Capitals investment in eBay | eBay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. Pierre Omidyar, the founder, had an existing relationship with Bruce Dunlevie from a previous company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. When Omidyar and Jeff Skoll sought funding for the fast-growing, profitable AuctionWeb, Benchmark was one of the few firms willing to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>.

    Benchmark's $6.7 million Series A investment valued [[Benchmark Capitals investment in eBay | eBay]] at a $20 million pre-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This was a non-consensus deal, as others saw it as a risky business selling "Beanie Babies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>. To incentivize Omidyar and Skoll not to accept a $50 million acquisition offer from Knight Ridder, Benchmark reportedly structured equity-backed loans to the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. This move, effectively a secondary, was highly untraditional at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>.

    [[Benchmark Capitals investment in eBay | eBay]] went public in September 1998, just over a year after Benchmark's investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>. Benchmark's stake, initially valued at $400 million at IPO, grew to over $4 billion by the time the lockup expired in spring 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. This translated to a 47x return on their Fund One, making it one of the best-performing venture funds in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:10">[01:44:10]</a>. The success of [[Benchmark Capitals investment in eBay | eBay]] cemented Benchmark's reputation and justified their 30% carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>. Benchmark famously shared pieces of carry with their assistants, leading to "multi-millionaires" among staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.

    *   **Accept.com**: After [[Benchmark Capitals investment in eBay | eBay]]'s success, Benchmark incubated Accept.com, a payment company for [[Benchmark Capitals investment in eBay | eBay]] sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. When [[Benchmark Capitals investment in eBay | eBay]] hesitated to invest, Benchmark sold Accept.com to Amazon for $175 million in Amazon stock, further strengthening their relationship with Jeff Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>.

## The "Imperial Era" and its Retreat (1999-2005)

Post-[[Benchmark Capitals investment in eBay | eBay]], Benchmark faced new challenges as they were overwhelmed with opportunities and became a target rather than a hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:43">[01:55:43]</a>. They debated how to manage their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:10">[01:57:10]</a>.

Against their core philosophy, Benchmark experimented with scaling:
*   **Larger Funds**: They raised a $1 billion Fund Four, a significant increase from their previous funds (Fund One: $85M, Fund Two: $150M, Fund Three: $175M) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">[02:17:59]</a>.
*   **International Expansion**: They expanded to Europe (raising a $750M fund, later cut to $500M) and Israel (raising a $220M fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:22">[02:18:22]</a>. These international funds were separate partnerships but leveraged the Benchmark brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:17">[02:19:17]</a>.
*   **Corporate Network**: They developed a "corporate network" to facilitate strategic partnerships between portfolio companies and large corporations like TSMC, Toshiba, Intel, Charles Schwab, E-Trade, and Cisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

However, they notably stuck to their principle of not bringing on junior partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>.

During this period, several significant "sins of omission" occurred:
*   **Google**: Benchmark had an opportunity to pursue Google but failed to do so with their characteristic hyper-competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Skype**: The international expansion led to confusion over who should lead an investment in Skype, ultimately resulting in a missed opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:32">[02:24:32]</a>.
*   **Facebook**: Benchmark was unable to invest in Facebook due to a conflict of interest, having already invested in Friendster, another social networking company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:11">[02:26:11]</a>.

Around 2004-2005, the firm recognized that their expansion had diverted them from their core strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">[02:30:28]</a>. They decided to "massively unwind" these initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:13">[02:30:13]</a>. Europe spun off to become Balderton Capital, and Israel became Aleph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:34">[02:30:34]</a>.

## Generational Transfer and the "Fab Four" Era (2006-2017)

This period marked a critical test of Benchmark's "equal partnership" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:10">[02:31:10]</a>. Original partners David Beirne and Andy Rachleff (and Alex Balkanski) stepped back from the management company, forgoing future carry in new funds, while remaining LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:42">[02:31:42]</a>. This maintained the clean break required for a true transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:20">[02:32:20]</a>.

### The New Blood: Bill Gurley and the Fab Four
The firm sought a new generation of partners who could be "fiercely competitive but also an unbelievable teammate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.

*   **Bill Gurley**: Bill Gurley joined Benchmark in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:23">[02:12:23]</a>. He had a background in engineering (Compaq), Wall Street (CS First Boston, doing the Amazon IPO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:07">[02:06:07]</a>, and prior VC experience at Hummer Winblad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>. Gurley was known for his analytical prowess, regularly publishing his "Above the Crowd" essays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:12">[02:06:12]</a>. The partners initially worried he might be "too intellectual" but ultimately recognized his "balls and brains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:18">[02:09:18]</a>. Gurley's first deal at Benchmark was Epinions, which later led to Naval Ravikant's ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:31">[02:12:31]</a>. He became known for his marketplace investments, including OpenTable, Zillow, and GrubHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:10">[02:14:10]</a>.

The firm then brought in Peter Fenton (from Accel, who had just invested in Facebook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:14">[02:34:14]</a>, Mitch Laskey (a games industry CEO of Jamdat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:09">[02:39:09]</a>, and Matt Cohler (employee #5 at Facebook and early at LinkedIn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:11">[02:41:11]</a>. This group, often referred to as the "Fab Four," re-founded the firm around its original principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:48">[02:34:48]</a>.

This era capitalized on the rise of mobile and the shift to Series A investing, where companies could show product-market fit and data before major VC rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:50">[02:14:50]</a>. Matt Cohler famously stated, "Our job as venture capitalists is not to see the future but to see the present very clearly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">[02:43:02]</a>.

### Major Successes of the Fab Four Era
Benchmark Fund 7 (2011, $550 million) was "ridiculous" in its success, building on the momentum of Fund Six (2006, $550 million), which already had hits like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:01">[02:46:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:28">[02:47:28]</a>.

Key investments during this period include:
*   **Instagram**: An early investment by Matt Cohler, which sold to Facebook 12 months after Benchmark's Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:08">[02:46:08]</a>.
*   **Asana**: Matt Cohler's first investment, founded by ex-Facebook employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:55">[02:46:55]</a>.
*   **New Relic, Hortonworks, Elastic**: Key enterprise investments by Peter Fenton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:54">[02:57:54]</a>.
*   **Snap, Discord**: Major consumer social investments by Mitch Laskey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:54">[02:40:54]</a>.
*   **Uber**: Bill Gurley led the Series A investment in 2011, a $10 million round at a $60 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:32">[02:56:32]</a>. Uber became the largest return in Fund 7, valued at $8 billion for Benchmark's stake in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:08">[02:54:08]</a>.

The "Fab Four" cultivated clear "swim lanes" for investing (marketplaces, consumer social, games, enterprise/open source) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:31">[02:51:31]</a>. A 2015 Forbes article, "The Benchmark Way," lauded the firm for making "other VC firms look outgunned and overstaffed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:59">[02:52:59]</a>.

### The Uber Lawsuit and its Aftermath
The relationship between Benchmark and Uber's founder, Travis Kalanick, deteriorated due to Uber's controversies and the immense pressure of its valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:30">[03:00:30]</a>. Bill Gurley, a board member, had publicly warned about out-of-control valuations and founder interests in the private markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:34">[03:03:34]</a>. Benchmark ultimately sued Travis Kalanick, a "Rubicon crossing move" in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. While the lawsuit didn't existentialy damage Benchmark's reputation, it "precipitate[d] the end of the Fab Four era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:34">[03:09:34]</a>, causing some partners to retire earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:45">[03:09:45]</a>.

By 2017-2018, Matt Cohler and Mitch Laskey stepped back, and Bill Gurley followed suit after one more fund cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:11">[03:10:11]</a>. Peter Fenton remains the only active GP from that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:24">[03:10:24]</a>.

## The Current Benchmark Partnership (2014-Present)

Benchmark continues its model of bringing in non-traditional, experienced partners:
*   **Eric Vishria**: Joined in 2014, previously VP of Marketing at Loudcloud/Opsware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:25">[03:11:25]</a>. His investments include Confluent (Series A, $7M, now $7.6B market cap), Amplitude, Benchling, and Cerebras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>.
*   **Sarah Tavel**: Joined in 2017 as the first woman GP at Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:56">[03:12:56]</a>. She was a junior analyst at Bessemer, sourced Pinterest, and then worked at Pinterest before joining Greylock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:55">[03:13:55]</a>. Her first investment was Chainalysis, a non-consensus crypto deal in 2017-2018, now valued at $8.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:56">[03:14:56]</a>. She often references the Howard Marks axiom: "in order to make money in investing you have to be both non-consensus and right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:52">[03:15:52]</a>.
*   **Chetan Puttagunta**: Joined in 2018, previously at NEA, with successful investments in Elastic, MuleSoft, and MongoDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:49">[03:17:49]</a>.
*   **Miles Grimshaw**: The most recent addition, joining in 2021 from Thrive Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:40">[03:18:40]</a>, where he was involved with companies like Benchling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:08">[03:19:08]</a>.

The current Benchmark partnership consists of Peter Fenton, Eric Vishria, Sarah Tavel, Chetan Puttagunta, and Miles Grimshaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:30">[03:19:30]</a>.

## The Benchmark Playbook

### [[Venture capital strategies and firm architecture | Counterpositioning]] and Branding
Benchmark's strategy is a pure example of [[Venture capital strategies and firm architecture | counterpositioning]] against the dominant firms of its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:01">[03:28:01]</a>. They aimed to be different by having an equal partnership and not scaling, forcing them to recruit partners who were truly equal in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:44">[03:28:44]</a>.

Their brand is so strong that their "American green dollars cost a lot more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:32">[03:32:32]</a>. Founders often accept lower valuations from Benchmark because their investment virtually guarantees a next round of capital from other VCs who revere Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:51">[03:33:51]</a>. Their current simple website (just "Benchmark" with contact info and a Twitter link) adds to their mystique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:40">[03:25:40]</a>.

### The "All-Stars Team" and Focus
The Benchmark model is defined by its "All-Stars team" approach, where every partner is expected to be a top performer and contribute equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:10">[03:29:10]</a>. This structure fosters a "culture of unbelievable trust" because there's no incentive for internal credit-claiming or competition among partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. Partners dedicate almost all their time to making investment decisions and supporting portfolio companies, avoiding management or career aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:03">[03:38:03]</a>. Board meetings for Benchmark partners are not pitches for the next round of capital, which provides a "more real relationship" with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:56">[03:36:56]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] David Rosenthal
> "This isn't to say every fund should all be equal the only way this works is if everyone truly brings the same amount of value to the partnership because otherwise over time you will have a situation where even if you're equal economically you become unequal in everybody realizing hey that person's not bringing it the way that we're bringing it and that creates just as big of a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>

This structure, however, creates a narrow pool for recruitment: partners must be established, top-tier VCs in their early 30s who are fiercely competitive but also team players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:16">[02:04:16]</a>. Partners also implicitly retire when they can no longer commit 100% effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:53">[01:46:53]</a>.

### Learning Machines and Adaptability
Benchmark is characterized as a firm of "learning machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:46">[03:39:46]</a>. They hold legendary Monday night dinners with public company CEOs and even founders of companies they missed, seeking to understand "why" they missed and how to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:20">[03:40:20]</a>.

The firm has shown a willingness to be experimental, not adhering rigidly to one strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:42">[03:40:42]</a>. Despite common perceptions, they have invested in late-stage growth rounds (like Dropbox in 2011) and even held public company shares when they saw intrinsic value (like OpenTable during the 2008-2010 downturn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:01">[03:41:01]</a>. They are masters of "breaking them when it makes sense to break them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:13">[03:42:13]</a>.

### Consumer Investing and Future Outlook
Historically, Benchmark's biggest wins have been in consumer companies (eBay, Uber, Snap, Riot, Twitter, Discord) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:49">[03:42:49]</a>, often making non-consensus bets. While the "Fab Four" era had clear swim lanes for consumer social and gaming, the current partnership seems more geared towards high-performing SaaS, B2B, and Enterprise investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:51">[03:43:51]</a>.

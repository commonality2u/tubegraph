This article explores the marketing and pricing strategies employed by two highly capital-efficient SaaS companies, Zoom and Veeva Systems, as discussed by their founders, Eric Yuan and Peter Gassner. Despite their differing [[Platform Business Models | business models]], both companies prioritized capital efficiency through distinct, yet fundamentally aligned, approaches to product, sales, and marketing.

## Veeva Systems: Enterprise-Focused Approach

Veeva Systems, founded in 2007, developed high-dollar software specifically for the life sciences industry, primarily pharmaceutical and biotech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Peter Gassner, Veeva's founder and CEO, aimed for a "clear and correct target market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>.

### Pricing Philosophy

Veeva's customers typically signed multi-million dollar annual deals with cash paid upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Despite the high value, Veeva intentionally avoided multi-year contracts or terms that would lock customers in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

[!quote|Reasoning for Annual Contracts]
"I was always optimizing for the long-term value, which is the annual value per customer. So if I had to give the customer terms that would lock them in, I thought that's actually shrinking my market because they'll pay less if they're locked in. That's one thing. Then the other one I didn't want us sort of getting lazy. I wanted us to earn the business every year." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>
— Peter Gassner
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>

This approach also helped maintain consistent pricing within their confined vertical market, preventing situations where some companies paid significantly less than others, which could lead to dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Sales and Customer Acquisition

As Veeva targeted large enterprise clients, a sales force was essential from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Peter Gassner himself was the first salesperson, beginning sales even before the company's articles of incorporation were signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

[!info|First Sale at Veeva]
Veeva's first customer, a small department, purchased software primarily because their CEO was "peeved with his IT team" and wanted to make a point, rather than a clear understanding of Veeva's product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This initial sale, made when the system could barely be logged into, required intense "hustle" to ensure customer success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

The company's first multi-million dollar annual deals, including with Pfizer, were secured through "hand-to-hand combat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Peter's argument to potential clients was that Veeva had "better people that will work harder" and were the client's "only shot at greatness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. The revenue from these early major deals was used to fund product development, acting as non-dilutive capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## Zoom: Product-Led Growth and Efficiency

Zoom, founded in 2011, entered a "very very mature market" where video conferencing was perceived as either a settled frontier or a race to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. Eric Yuan, Zoom's founder and CEO, focused on building a "better solution" than existing competitors like Webex, Skype, and Google Hangouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.

### Marketing Strategy

For the first four years, Zoom had no marketing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Their strategy was based on the belief that if the product worked well, a marketing team wasn't initially necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

[!quote|Early Customer Feedback]
"A lot of customers, a customer told us Eric, I never heard about Zoom, but I tried the product, the product works. Right? Why is that? We received a very consistent feedback like that. I know that's a signal. Right? Then we doubled on that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00">[49:00]</a>
— Eric Yuan

Early user acquisition was significantly boosted by a positive review from technology reporter Walt Mossberg in the Wall Street Journal, which generated 50,000 users overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Although most left after several weeks, the loyal remaining users formed the "kernel of the virality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Eric personally engaged with canceling customers to understand their reasons and retained a "very good personal relationship" with early adopters, even sending them gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

Zoom established a marketing team in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Eric emphasizes measuring every marketing program's spending. He learned to push for higher returns on investment, stating that if `$1` spent on SEM returned `$1.50`, it should be optimized to return `$3` or even `$4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Physical billboards were found to validate customer decisions and boost employee morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

### Pricing Strategy

Zoom's initial pricing for most users was $9.99 a month, with the largest paid customer only generating $2,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This made it challenging to fund product development solely from customer revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

Eric's pricing strategy for Zoom was likened to a new restaurant: offering "better service, right and a better price and a better food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Zoom consistently aims to have a "better price across the board" than its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. The trade-off for this competitive pricing is internal operational efficiency, such as having a smaller sales team (e.g., 50 sales reps instead of 100) that can deliver the same value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

### Challenges with Online Business Model

Eric notes that while Zoom's online business is "very profitable," it presents challenges in predictability due to higher churn rates (customers canceling service after a few months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. This contrasts with the more stable enterprise portion of their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of a well-considered [[open_source_business_models_and_strategies | business model]] for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This highlights a key [[Challenges of launching a subscriptionbased online business | challenge for subscription-based online businesses]] compared to enterprise sales.

## Shared Principles of Capital Efficiency

Both Eric Yuan and Peter Gassner exemplify a mindset of [[Adapting business models in initial stages | capital efficient growth]], viewing it as a "mindset and culture thing more than a [[Platform Business Models | business model]] thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### Product Excellence as Marketing

A foundational principle for both companies is that "product excellence" is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. They view themselves as product people who were maniacally focused on building a superior offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Peter Gassner states that an "excellent product" is the "best way you can lower your cost of sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Eric Yuan reinforces this, stating, "if a product doesn't work, forget it, everything else just double down, triple down on product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

### Operational Efficiency

Both founders stressed the importance of extreme frugality and avoiding "wasted people" in the early days to minimize cash burn and simplify decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Peter compared hiring to "buying a million dollar machine," ensuring every person provided worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This internal efficiency directly translated to [[Challenges and strategies in advertising and monetization | capital efficiency]] and healthy operational margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

### Strategic Investment in Marketing

While initially cautious, both companies recognized the value of strategic marketing as they scaled. Zoom's experience with billboards indicated that marketing could validate their position and boost morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. However, Eric cautions that founders must actively engage in marketing and learn to measure its effectiveness, only spending when the return on investment is clear and optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

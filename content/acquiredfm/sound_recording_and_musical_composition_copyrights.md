The purpose of copyright law is to spur innovation and creativity across all forms of intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, and patents [00:00:20]. When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence [00:00:44].

## Two Types of Music Copyrights

### 1. Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording)

The first copyright is the sound recording copyright, also known as a master recording or simply a master [00:00:50]. This copyright applies to the literal recording of the music as it was created in the studio and heard by the audience [01:00:00].

Traditionally, the master recording is owned by the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] [00:00:55]. Historically, labels assume ownership of these masters in exchange for taking on the financial risk associated with betting on, distributing, and promoting an artist's work [01:11:11]. This model has been compared to the old-school venture capital industry, where investors would take a majority stake in a company for providing the initial capital [01:21:21].

Today, the [[the_business_and_rights_dynamics_in_the_music_industry | music industry]] is dominated by approximately three major [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record labels]], and due to the high demand among aspiring artists, market terms have remained favorable to labels [01:56:56].

#### Economic Splits and Recoupment for Masters

When an artist signs a [[the_evolution_of_music_distribution_and_streaming | distribution]] deal where a [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] fronts the money to produce an album and subsequently owns the master, the artist's royalty stream is independently negotiated [05:35:35]. Typically, artists might receive only 10-15% of the revenues, with very large artists potentially negotiating up to 20-22% [05:46:46]. The vast majority of [[economic_splits_and_recoupment_in_music_deals | economic splits]] go to the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] [05:51:51].

A critical concept in these deals is [[economic_splits_and_recoupment_in_music_deals | recoupment]] [05:58:58]. Artists only begin to participate in revenues after an upfront advance provided by the label has been recouped [06:03:03]. For example, if a label provides a $500,000 advance, the label keeps all generated revenue until that $500,000 is repaid, after which the artist receives their negotiated percentage [06:13:13]. This system is akin to a venture capital preference stack on a cap table [06:36:36].

These structures arose from an era when producing an album, securing radio play, and achieving [[the_evolution_of_music_distribution_and_streaming | distribution]] and customer acquisition were incredibly expensive [06:46:50]. Furthermore, most artists fail, and the labels (or publishers, or VCs) need the economic benefit from successful artists to offset the investments in those who don't succeed [07:07:08].

### 2. Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)

The second copyright is the musical composition copyright, or the publishing right [02:05:05]. This copyright covers the written lyrics and melody â€“ essentially the "idea" of the song that could be put down on sheet music, before it's even played or recorded [02:10:10].

Historically, these rights are held by the songwriters themselves, often through their [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | music publishers]] [02:13:13]. Publishers traditionally managed these composition copyrights in a similar way that [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record labels]] handled masters [02:45:45]. While publishers used to take 50% of the royalties from composition copyrights, today they take significantly less [02:50:50]. For larger songwriters, the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | publisher]] might only receive a fixed fee for administrative services [02:56:56]. Therefore, it's often considered that the songwriter directly owns their musical composition copyrights and decides on their licensing [03:05:05].

[[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | Publishers]] held immense power before the era of recorded [[the_business_and_rights_dynamics_in_the_music_industry | music]], when publishing rights (sheet music) were the primary rights [03:27:27]. During this time, artists and [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record labels]] were dependent on publishers because singers were not typically the same as the songwriters [03:37:37].

#### Co-writers

Songwriting credits can be split in any way and are privately negotiated among co-writers [03:33:33]. For approvals requiring a publishing license, multiple co-writers might need to sign off [03:43:43]. The financial splits can also vary wildly, from 50/50 to 90/10, or even involve flat fees or small royalties for guest writers [03:53:53]. For example, there would be a privately negotiated deal between Taylor Swift and co-writers like Liz Rose [05:04:04].

## Licensing and Veto Rights

These two copyrights form the foundational building blocks for all other uses of [[the_business_and_rights_dynamics_in_the_music_industry | music]] [03:52:52]. Some uses of [[the_business_and_rights_dynamics_in_the_music_industry | music]] may require approval from only one copyright owner, while other uses require approval from both the owner of the sound recording master right and the owner of the publishing right [03:57:57]. For use cases that require both, both parties effectively have a veto right over the use of the final product [04:05:05]. The [[economic_splits_and_recoupment_in_music_deals | economic splits]] and income generated vary widely depending on the specific use of the [[the_business_and_rights_dynamics_in_the_music_industry | music]] [04:17:17].

Even in the past, the 50/50 split between [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | publishers]] and writers on the songwriting economics was considered very good from the artist's perspective, especially when compared to the splits artists received from [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | labels]] on the master side [05:15:15].

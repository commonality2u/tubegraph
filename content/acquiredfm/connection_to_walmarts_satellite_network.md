Linkabit, a company founded by Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi, made a pivotal shift from defense contracting to commercial projects by securing a contract to build [[walmarts_technology_adoption_and_ecommerce_strategy | Walmart's]] private satellite network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Linkabit's Genesis and Shift to Commercial Work

Irwin Jacobs, after completing his PhD at MIT under Claude Shannon, spent five years teaching at MIT, where he taught the world's first course on digital communications and co-authored the first textbook on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. In 1964, he took a sabbatical at JPL (Jet Propulsion Labs) to work on the U.S. Space Program and satellite communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. There, he met Andrew Viterbi, a fellow MIT electrical engineering PhD graduate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Jacobs and Viterbi later moved to San Diego to start the electrical engineering department at UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. They continued their consulting work for defense contractors and the U.S. Space Program, often working on [[contributions_to_satellite_communications_and_defense_projects | satellite communications]] projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Recognizing the difficulty in balancing their consulting with academic work, they decided to form a "shell company" called Linkabit to manage their consulting efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This company, initially not intended to make products, began to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. By 1971, Linkabit had built an "army" of experts in information theory and wireless signals, primarily for defense contracting and satellite work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

The founders realized that defense contractors were making most of the money as prime bidders, while Linkabit was doing the "differentiated engineering work" as a sub-consultant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This led them to consider bidding on contracts themselves and moving into the commercial sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Walmart's Innovative Satellite Network

Linkabit's first major commercial project was to build the [[walmarts_technology_adoption_and_ecommerce_strategy | satellite communication system]] for [[walmarts_technology_adoption_and_ecommerce_strategy | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. [[walmarts_technology_adoption_and_ecommerce_strategy | Walmart]], then a "small Midwestern Regional retailer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, was for a long time considered the most innovative retailer on the planet until Amazon emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[walmarts_technology_adoption_and_ecommerce_strategy | Walmart]] invested tens of millions of dollars into building a private satellite relay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. This was necessary because the available bandwidth on the internet (which was still the ARPANET at the time) was insufficient for their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. The network allowed [[walmarts_technology_adoption_and_ecommerce_strategy | Walmart]] to send daily or weekly store data for tabulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Furthermore, [[sam_waltons_retail_innovations_and_business_philosophies | Sam Walton]], the eccentric founder, wanted to use the network to broadcast himself talking daily from headquarters to all local stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

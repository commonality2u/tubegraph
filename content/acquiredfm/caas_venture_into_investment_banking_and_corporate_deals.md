Creative Artists Agency (CAA) expanded its operations beyond talent representation, venturing into investment banking and corporate deal-making. This strategic shift was driven by the financial instability of major Hollywood studios during the late 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.

## Rationale for Diversification

Michael Ovitz observed that studios like Universal, Columbia, MGM, and Warner Bros. were facing financial difficulties, with corporate raiders taking stock positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>. He understood that if these companies went out of business or significantly reduced their budgets, it would directly impact CAA, as the agency could not finance large movie budgets itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>. CAA was not permitted to produce content due to guild rules and potential conflicts with its own clients, who often ran guilds like the Writers Guild and Directors Guild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. The primary objective was to ensure the existence of buyers with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>.

Ovitz forged relationships in Japan, particularly with divisions of Matsushita Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:38">[01:23:38]</a>. He also developed a close relationship with Herbert Allen, a brilliant investment banker who taught him much about the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.

## Key Deals and Strategies

### CBS Records Acquisition by Sony

Ovitz became involved in the sale of CBS Records to Sony, building a relationship with Norio Ohga, Sony's number two executive, who later introduced him to Akio Morita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a>. He consulted on this deal, which led to Sony's interest in owning content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>. Morita's motivation stemmed from Betamax's loss to VHS, despite being a superior technology, highlighting the importance of content ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>.

### Sony Pictures Entertainment (Columbia & TriStar) Acquisition

Ovitz facilitated a meeting between Akio Morita and Kirk Kerkorian, who owned MGM, to discuss a potential sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>. Morita famously brought a prototype of a tiny video camera to the meeting, demonstrating Sony's technological prowess and captivating Kerkorian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. Although the MGM deal didn't gain traction, Ovitz and Herbert Allen then worked on the acquisition of Columbia and TriStar, which were owned by Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. This deal resulted in the creation of Sony Pictures Entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>.

The financial approach for these deals was unique: instead of requesting an upfront fee, Ovitz offered to work for expenses if unsuccessful, but expected an "obscene sum of money" if successful, exceeding all prior fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. This strategy paid off in multiples, leading to handsome payments without ever discussing specific numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>. For the Matsushita deal, he was given $120 million to distribute among consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:23">[01:30:23]</a>.

### Matsushita's Acquisition of MCA Universal

Ovitz attempted to broker the sale of MCA Universal to Sony, but Lou Wasserman, then head of Universal, initially refused to sell to the Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>. However, when MCA's stock plummeted, Wasserman changed his stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:56">[01:30:56]</a>. Ovitz consulted with Matsushita (the parent company of Panasonic) on their acquisition of MCA Universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>. Ovitz offered his insights on Japanese culture to Wasserman, but Wasserman declined to collaborate after the deal was consummated, which Ovitz believes marked "the beginning of the end for him" at Universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>. Matsushita ultimately had a "very bad experience" with Universal due to communication issues and the studio heads' inability to transition to being employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:26">[01:32:26]</a>.

### Attempted Warner Brothers Takeover

Before the Warner Bros. and Time Inc. merger, Ovitz and Herbert Allen had quietly accumulated 14% of Warner Brothers' stock for the Bronfman family (Seagram's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>. Ovitz met with Steve Ross, offering $6 billion in cash with a standstill agreement. However, Ross's subsequent illness and passing led to the deal falling apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:53">[01:34:53]</a>.

## Learning and Application

Ovitz dedicated significant effort to understanding Japanese culture, reading extensively, studying the language and art, which proved crucial in his business dealings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. This deep cultural understanding allowed him to navigate complex international transactions successfully.

He asserts that his work in the digital world today, which involves "packaging" young founders with money and distribution, is fundamentally the same as what he did for 35 years in Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>. His approach remains consistent: identifying talent (founders), surrounding them with more talent, securing financing, aiding in marketing and strategy, and monetizing their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:28">[01:47:28]</a>. This highlights a continuous thread in his [[the_role_of_venture_capital_and_its_challenges | career]], demonstrating that core principles of packaging and leveraging talent apply across different industries, from entertainment to [[venture_capital_investment_strategies | technology investments]].

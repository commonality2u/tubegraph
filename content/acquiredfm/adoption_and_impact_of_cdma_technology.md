[[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)]] was adopted as a major 2G standard for mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Its market share in 2G reached 57% in the US and 100% in countries like South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | CDMA]] also secured a massive market share in China as the country adopted mobile communication for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The first [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | CDMA]] networks went live in the US and internationally in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Financial and Strategic Evolution of Qualcomm

Qualcomm's revenue significantly increased following the adoption of [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | CDMA]], growing from \$383 million in 1995 to \$814 million in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Despite this growth, Wall Street was initially unimpressed, with the stock remaining largely flat until 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This was primarily due to the heavy capital requirements of their manufacturing operations and joint ventures, which tied up company profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

In 1999, Qualcomm made a crucial strategic decision to divest its capital-intensive manufacturing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. In March 1999, they sold their infrastructure business (base stations) to Ericsson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Following this, in December 1999, Kyocera acquired Qualcomm's mobile phone business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

This shift enabled Qualcomm to focus on two core high-margin business groups:
*   **Qualcomm [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | CDMA]] Technologies Group (QTC)**: Dedicated to selling semiconductor chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)**: Focused on licensing its extensive [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | patent]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Their licensing model became highly lucrative, typically charging five percent of the selling price of phones that used their [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | patents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Market Reaction and Subsequent Growth
After shedding its manufacturing burden, Qualcomm's stock performance surged dramatically. In the year 2000, Qualcomm was the single best-performing stock, appreciating 2621% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Although the stock crashed over the next 18 months, it still represented a significant 4x gain from its pre-1999 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### 3G and the Dominance of CDMA
The transition to 3G networks saw [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | CDMA]] become the dominant standard globally, despite initial debates between GSM and [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | CDMA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This was largely because 3G was focused on broadband internet data speeds, and [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | CDMA]] was technologically superior for handling digital information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Leadership Transition and 4G Preparation
In 2005, Qualcomm's founder, Irwin Jacobs, retired, and his son, Paul Jacobs, a PhD in electrical engineering and long-time Qualcomm employee, took over as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Also in 2005, Qualcomm acquired Flarion Technologies for \$600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This acquisition was strategic, providing Qualcomm with essential [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | patents]] for 4G technology, specifically in Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. While [[code_division_multiple_access_cdma_innovation_and_patent | CDMA]] had been a game-changer, it was a 20-year-old technology by this point and OFDMA proved more efficient for the demands of 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This move allowed Qualcomm to maintain its lucrative [[qualcomms_patent_strategy_and_economic_impact | patent licensing]] business model for the next generation of wireless technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Under Paul Jacobs' leadership (2005-2013/14), Qualcomm's attempt to lead in the Internet of Things (IoT) initially struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. However, this era saw two critical developments:
*   Qualcomm's pivot from initially resisting OFDMA to embracing it as the 4G standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   The initiation of the [[impact_and_evolution_of_qualcomms_snapdragon_technology | Snapdragon]] mobile Systems-on-a-Chip (SoCs) and CPUs, which positioned them favorably for the modern smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

Today, Qualcomm manufactures the high-end chips for Android phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> and broadly brands its products under the [[impact_and_evolution_of_qualcomms_snapdragon_technology | Snapdragon]] name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The company currently earns an average of about \$20 for every smartphone sold worldwide, including Apple iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Despite its success, Qualcomm has faced litigation, including an Anti-Trust lawsuit from the FTC, regarding its [[qualcomms_patent_strategy_and_economic_impact | patent licensing]] practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

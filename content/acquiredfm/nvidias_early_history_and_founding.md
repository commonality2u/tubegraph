Nvidia, founded in 1993, began its journey in the highly competitive and low-margin computer graphics chip market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Initially, there were 90 undifferentiated competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. Despite this, Nvidia would later achieve an 83% market share of standalone GPUs for desktop and laptop computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The company has a history of [[nvidias_risktaking_and_decisionmaking_in_technology_development | risk-taking and decision-making]], with co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang betting the company three separate times, nearly going bankrupt each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## The Founder: Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang was born in Taiwan in February 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. When he was four, his father, an engineer for Carrier, visited New York City and decided he wanted his children to grow up in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. Jensen's mother taught him and his older brother English using a dictionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

At age nine, Jensen and his brother were sent to America, attending Oneida Baptist Institute, a reform school in Eastern Kentucky, because it was affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Jensen's 17-year-old roommate had just been released from prison with seven stab wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This experience instilled in Jensen a tolerance for discomfort and a lack of fear about going to new places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. He helped his roommate with math, and in return, learned weightlifting, explaining his strong physique today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. Jensen and his wife, Lori, have since donated millions to the school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

A few years later, his parents joined them in the US, first in Tacoma, Washington, then the suburbs of Portland, Oregon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. Jensen skipped two grades and attended Oregon State University at 16, majoring in electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. He loved electrical engineering and became one of the top students, initially frustrated by professors' lack of precision but later understanding the importance of the big picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. He also met his future wife, Lori, in an electrical engineering class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

After graduating in 1984, Jensen moved to Silicon Valley and joined AMD as a junior manager in chip development, working on a 1 MHz CPU chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. He concurrently pursued a master's degree in electrical engineering at Stanford, which took him eight years to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. He realized that designing chips was incredibly difficult and mostly a manual process at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.

Jensen then joined LSI Logic, a pioneering ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) company that created custom chips for specific functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. LSI Logic had provided Sequoia Capital with its largest IPO return at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. While at LSI Logic, Jensen worked extensively with Sun Microsystems, helping to build chips for their SPARCstation 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.

## The Idea for Nvidia

In late 1992, after finishing his master's degree, Jensen met with two Sun engineers, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, at Denny's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>. They pitched the idea of creating a chip to accelerate 3D graphics on consumer PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>. At this time, 3D graphics were emerging, driven by high demand from professional applications like Silicon Graphics (SGI) and the nascent PC gaming market, with hits like *Wolfenstein 3D* and *Doom* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>. The PC wave was cresting, and specialized peripheral companies were already making sound and networking cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>. The idea was to offload graphics processing from the CPU to a dedicated card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>.

## Funding and Naming

Jensen resigned from LSI Logic, and his CEO, Wilf Corrigan (former CEO of Fairchild Semiconductor), referred him to Don Valentine of Sequoia Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>. Despite Jensen botching the pitch, Valentine invested due to Corrigan's strong recommendation, with a caveat: "If you lose my money, I'll kill you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>. Sutter Hill Ventures also joined the $2 million seed round at a $6 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>.

For a name, they looked to their internal file-saving convention, "NV" (short for "next version") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. They found the Latin word "invidia," meaning "envy," and decided on Nvidia, aiming to be "the envy of the industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. Their logo's green color was chosen to align with "Green With Envy" marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>.

Nvidia's initial perspective was to enable graphics as a new medium for storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>. Jensen believed computer graphics could create interactive, networked stories, unlike pre-recorded entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:10:00">[33:10:00]</a>. This vision kept them going for the first 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Reinvention

Nvidia faced intense competition, with 89 other companies entering the graphics card market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>. Initially, Nvidia secured a significant deal with Sega to power their arcade and next-generation home consoles (Sega Saturn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>. However, Nvidia and Sega made a critical design error by choosing quadrilaterals instead of triangles as the polygon primitive for 3D graphics, which later became the industry standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>. Triangles are the most fundamental building block for 3D shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>.

Microsoft entered the market by developing Direct3D (later DirectX), an API baked directly into Windows, which standardized on triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>. This put Nvidia in a difficult position, as their competitors adopted Microsoft's standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:00">[38:01:00]</a>. In 1996, Sega abandoned Nvidia's NV2 chip, switching to triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19:00">[39:19:00]</a>. Compounding their problems, the price of memory dropped significantly due to Moore's Law, making Nvidia's memory-tight chip designs more expensive than competitors' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>.

Facing bankruptcy with only nine months of runway left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:58:00">[40:58:00]</a>, Jensen made a [[nvidias_risktaking_and_decisionmaking_in_technology_development | "bet the company" decision]] to scrap their existing designs and fully embrace Microsoft's DirectX standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:59:00">[41:59:00]</a>. This required intellectual honesty, admitting their initial strategy failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:25:00">[41:25:00]</a>. They laid off 70% of the company, reducing staff to about 35 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a>.

Their only chance was to out-engineer competitors by designing and shipping a new chip in nine months, a process that typically took two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>. They achieved this by investing $1 million (a third of their cash) in experimental chip emulation software, allowing them to debug designs at an excruciatingly slow rate of one frame every 30 seconds, rather than waiting for physical prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>. This [[nvidias_innovation_and_adaptation_strategies | innovation and adaptation strategy]] was born out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

## The Reva 128 and Market Dominance

In 1997, Nvidia launched the Reva 128, a powerful chip designed using this accelerated process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>. While it had flaws (only two-thirds of Direct3D's blend modes worked), Nvidia convinced developers to work within these limitations in exchange for superior performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:20:00">[50:20:00]</a>. This showed Nvidia the market's strong demand for performance, even at the cost of some features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:40:00">[51:40:00]</a>. Consumers drove the market by prioritizing graphics quality, influencing game developers' targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:00">[52:05:00]</a>. The Reva 128 sold 1 million units within four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:55:00">[54:55:00]</a>.

This success attracted TSMC, who previously wouldn't return Jensen's calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Jensen wrote a physical letter to Morris Chang, TSMC's founder, who then called Jensen directly, leading to a multi-year deal for TSMC to become Nvidia's primary foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. This partnership was a landmark for both companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.

## The Rise of GeForce and the GPU Concept

In 1999, Nvidia rebranded its products under the "GeForce" line (short for "Geometry Force") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. The GeForce 256, released that year, offered 5x better graphics performance than anything else on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>. Nvidia controversially coined the term "Graphics Processing Unit" (GPU) for this chip, a "loaded statement" challenging Intel's CPU dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

Intel's strategy at the time was to integrate successful peripherals (like sound and networking cards) into their motherboards, commoditizing specialized businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. Nvidia's declaration of a "GPU" was a "middle finger" to Intel, asserting that graphics processing was not a commodity that could be easily integrated into a CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>.

## Xbox Deal and Programmable Shaders

Nvidia went public in 1999 with a $600 million market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>. They then secured a massive $500 million per year deal with [[nvidias_relationship_with_microsoft_and_the_video_game_industry | Microsoft]] to supply the GPU for the original Xbox, which included a $200 million advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. The Xbox's GPU was a modified version of Nvidia's groundbreaking GeForce 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>.

The GeForce 3 introduced programmable shaders and dynamic lighting on the GPU, a "game-changing" advancement in [[history_and_evolution_of_nvidias_graphics_technology | graphics technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. Previously, GPUs executed pre-programmed instructions for lighting; now, developers could write programs directly for the GPU, creating dynamically calculated effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. This was another "bet the company" move for Jensen, allowing for unique artistic expression in games and differentiating Nvidia's hardware with specialized software (CG language) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. This solidified the GPU as an intelligent processing unit, not just a graphics card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Early 2000s and Shifting Focus

This period saw a meteoric rise for Nvidia, becoming the fastest semiconductor company to reach $1 billion in revenue, achieving $1.4 billion in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:33">[01:22:33]</a>. However, after 2001, revenue plateaued, and gross margins remained low (29% in 2004 compared to 66% today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:15">[01:30:15]</a>. The Xbox deal, while strategically sound, provided very low-margin revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

Competitors like ATI (later acquired by AMD in 2006) also started adopting programmable shaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. Nvidia's constant need to reinvent itself is a testament to Jensen's quote: "When technology moves this fast, if you're not reinventing yourself, you're just slowly dying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

Around this time, Nvidia's programmable GPUs started attracting researchers outside of gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:55">[01:25:55]</a>. A quantum chemistry researcher at Stanford reportedly used Nvidia's GeForce cards and CG language to run a computation in hours that previously took weeks on a supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a>. This hinted at the future of [[nvidias_transition_from_gaming_to_enterprise_and_scientific_computing | Nvidia's transition from gaming to enterprise and scientific computing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>.

AMD, then primarily a CPU manufacturer, attempted to acquire Nvidia in 2006 to strengthen their graphics line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48">[01:28:48]</a>. The deal fell through because Jensen insisted on being the CEO of the combined company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a>. AMD then acquired ATI instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:45">[01:29:45]</a>.

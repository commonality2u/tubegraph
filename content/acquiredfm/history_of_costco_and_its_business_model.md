Costco, a prominent retailer, has been a significant investment for Charlie Munger, who has served on its board of directors. Munger views Costco as one of the rare "few moments in a lifetime" investment opportunities where one can "bet heavily" because they "know you're right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

## Munger's Early Involvement and Investment
Charlie Munger first encountered Price Club, the precursor to Costco, through Rod Hills, who knew Sol Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Munger drove down to visit and speak with Sol Price, an "intelligent man" who had started the Government Employees Discount Company at age 39 after being a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Munger invested in Price Club by buying stock in the market before its merger with Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Jim Sinegal, then CEO of Costco, later asked Warren Buffett to join the board as an independent director with a financial reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Buffett declined, suggesting Munger instead due to shorter plane rides to director's meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This led to Munger's involvement with Costco's board.

Berkshire Hathaway, Munger and Buffett's company, attempted to acquire Costco when Carrefour, a French company, was divesting its stake, but Warren Buffett "wouldn't do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Buffett's reluctance stemmed from his general dislike and fear of retail, considering it "too damn difficult" due to the high rate of failure among "monz mighty" retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## The Costco Business Model
Munger highlights several key virtues that made Costco a standout business:
*   **Low Prices and Efficiency** They consistently sold cheaper than anyone else in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This was achieved through big, efficient stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Ample Parking** Stores featured 10-foot wide parking spaces, wider than the normal 8 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Membership Model** Costco kept out people who didn't do big volumes and offered special benefits like reward points through the executive membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Capital-Light Structure** The business model is described as "capital light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Costco has "no investment in them" as they make suppliers wait for payment until after goods are sold, meaning they have high-quality merchandise in 900 warehouses around the world without having it "sitting on their books" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This is a form of "leverage" without traditional debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   **Low SKU Count** Costco effectively leverages a low Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Customer Demographics** Interestingly, Costco's audience "skews wealthy" with "smart wealthy customers" who are also "picky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. This was an intentional strategy from the Price Club days, as Sol Price "always wanted the rich man trying to save money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

> [!quote] The "Central Norm"
> "The central norm was don't raise the market, get it low and keep it there forever." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>

A famous example of this norm is the unchanging price of Costco's hot dogs, which is seen as "half famous" and contributes to people bringing their kids to the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.

### Leadership and Culture
Richard Galanti, a long-time executive at Costco, is highlighted for his extensive knowledge of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. The success of Costco is attributed to the "magic of the business model and culture" combined with "very reliable hardworking determined execution for 40 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>.

An internal struggle occurred within Costco's early leadership where co-founder Jeff Brotman, initially intended to be Chairman and CEO, moved aside for Jim Sinegal to become CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

## Growth and Expansion Challenges
Costco's growth rate, around 10% per year, is limited not by capital constraints but by the difficulty of opening too many new stores annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. Each new store requires a new manager, new politics, and significant learning and teaching to put systems in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>.

For a long time, Costco was reluctant to expand into China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. The first attempted store opening was thwarted by a $30,000 bribe request, which left such a bad impression on Jim Sinegal that he refused to consider China for about 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. The board eventually agitated for entry into the Chinese market, leading to its eventual presence there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

## Comparison and Imitation

[[history_and_development_of_walmart | Walmart]] was accustomed to cheap real estate in small towns and efficient big stores, which made them resistant to paying for good locations in rich suburbs where Costco specialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

Marcus even visited Sol Price, who was "happy to share the Playbook with everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. Floor & Decor is noted as a current imitator of the Costco model in vinyl flooring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.

While there are many imitators, Munger suggests that few opportunities like Home Depot and Costco remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.# History and Business Model of Costco

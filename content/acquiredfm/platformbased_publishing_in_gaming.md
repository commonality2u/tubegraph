Platform-based publishing has emerged as a significant business model in the gaming industry, transforming how games are distributed and consumed. This approach leverages [[the_influence_of_technology_platforms_on_independent_content_creation | online platforms]] to aggregate user demand and subsequently influence the supply side of a market, akin to how tech giants such as Uber and Airbnb have reshaped their respective domains. Below we'll explore this concept, its evolution, and its impacts within the gaming landscape, referencing insights from Mitch Lasky and Blake Robbins from the Gamecraft podcast.

## The Genesis of Platform-Based Publishing

Traditionally, gaming distribution was dominated by physical sales, with a focus on packaging goods and selling them through retail outlets. However, the advent of digital distribution platforms marked a shift in how games reached consumers. Platforms such as Steam, which began as a software updater for Valve's products, gradually expanded to encompass entire gaming ecosystems, becoming indispensable to both developers and players. Steam's success, generating billions in revenue, exemplifies [[the_impact_of_platforms_in_modern_business | how platform-based models have leveraged demand]] to advantageously position themselves within the industry.

### Steam as a Pioneer

Steam, launched by Valve, is a quintessential example of a platform-based publisher. Originally intended as a utility for patching games, it morphed into a comprehensive digital storefront that continuously added features like community interactions, app stores, and mod support. This led to its exponential growth, with Valve maintaining a compelling market position, as evidenced by Microsoft's Phil Spencer acknowledging the necessity of placing games on Steam to reach broader audiences (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>).

## Current Landscape and Key Players

While Steam set the precedent, other players like Epic Games have attempted to emulate its model by launching their own platforms. Epic's approach includes leveraging the immense popularity of Fortnite and offering incentives to developers to use its store over Steam. However, as observed, Epic faces challenges in competing with Steam's established dominance (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>).

### The Challenge of Entry

Breaking into the platform-based publishing space is formidable. Mitch outlines that while new entrants like Epic and Discord have attempted to create their own ecosystems, successfully competing with established giants like Steam requires substantial leverage and market power. Discord, despite its vast user base, struggled to establish a games store due to the challenges of [[technology_companies_and_strategies | building a platform from scratch]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>).

## Nintendo's Potential Transition

Looking towards future developments, platforms such as Nintendo, with its significant base of loyal users but limited third-party revenue models, might be poised to embrace platform-based publishing. Mitch predicts that Nintendo may soon reform its business [[strategies_and_investment | strategy to mimic the success of other platforms]] by enhancing its app store capabilities, aiming to increase third-party revenue streams dramatically (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>).

## The Future of Platform-Based Publishing

As digital distribution continues to evolve, maintaining a successful platform will require continuous innovation and adaptation. Platforms must find the balance between proprietary content and fostering a vibrant ecosystem that encourages third-party development. The integration of cloud gaming, cross-platform play, and new business models like subscription services will likely influence [[business_strategy_and_technology_impact | the trajectory of platform-based publishing]] in the coming years.

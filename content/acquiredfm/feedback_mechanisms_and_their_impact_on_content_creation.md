The journey of content creation, particularly in a subscription-based model, is heavily influenced by the feedback mechanisms available to the creator. Understanding and prioritizing the right signals is crucial for growth and sustainability.

## Early Challenges and Misconceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

Initial efforts to launch a paid subscription model faced significant skepticism, especially from people in tech and venture capitalists, who believed "subscriptions are not a thing on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The creator set one-day, one-week, and one-month goals for new subscribers but failed to reach any of them significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

The initial product itself was flawed:
*   A security certificate issue prevented purchases for the first 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   The product was "super confusing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   It failed to provide a good experience for non-paying customers or paying customers, being "very janky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

This led to a realization that while the business model might be right, the product was wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The website was torn down, and the strategy pivoted to delivering extra content via daily emails to subscribers, initially feeling "completely and utterly ass backwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The belief was always that the website should be primary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Despite these early struggles, including double-charging subscribers and dealing with refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, the creator persevered due to a "pride factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> and the belief that the business model could work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## The Power of Subscription Numbers as Feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

A crucial turning point came when subscriber numbers began to show consistent growth: April had more subscribers than March, June more than May, and July was on pace to surpass June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This direct feedback, even with only a "couple hundred" subscribers initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, provided confidence that the model would work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Simplifying the subscription model to one price and one product also contributed to clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The most significant growth spurt occurred when it became clear the venture was an "ongoing entity," leading to 250 new subscribers in 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This showed that the main barrier to subscriptions wasn't lack of interest, but a psychological fear among potential subscribers that the creator would fail and they would lose their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

> "I was right about the market I just I didn't understand that psychological aspect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>

Platforms like Substack have since made it easier to pay, but more importantly, have normalized the idea that people aren't scared to give money to "some random writer on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Navigating Public vs. Private Feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>

The creator emphasizes that subscriber numbers offer a superior feedback mechanism compared to social media engagement:
*   Writers inherently seek feedback and affirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Relying on platforms like [[the_dynamics_and_changing_strategies_of_social_media_platforms_like_twitter | Twitter]] for feedback means engaging with a very small, often vocal minority (e.g., "the same 10 people or 30 people" representing "point two percent of your audience") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   Subscription numbers, conversely, reflect a "huge number of people that like and appreciate and are sharing" the content, even if they remain "dark matter" (unknown) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

This direct financial feedback allows creators to "anchor" on what the majority of their audience values, rather than being swayed by "loudmouths on [[the_dynamics_and_changing_strategies_of_social_media_platforms_like_twitter | Twitter]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. It provides an incentive structure where the focus is on keeping subscribers happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

While there's a potential [[challenges_and_strategies_in_developing_impactful_content | challenge]] of pandering to an audience, a sufficiently large subscriber base grants creators the autonomy to not "care" if someone cancels, even refunding rude subscribers to avoid further engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This differs significantly from models reliant on large advertisers, where a single large entity like [[evolution_of_facebook_and_meta | Apple]] withdrawing advertising can cause panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## Adapting Content Delivery for Audience Consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>

The accidental reliance on email initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> evolved into a deliberate strategy to make content as accessible as possible. While the website remains primary for discovery and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, email is recognized for its push nature, similar to [[podcast_growth_and_audience_dynamics | podcasts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

> "Email is a tactic, it's not a strategy...the strategy is about differentiation, it's about consistency, and I want it to be easy to use and fit in your life." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>

Content is now available via [[podcast_growth_and_audience_dynamics | podcast]] for daily updates and articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, SMS links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, and RSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. The goal is to make it "as easy for you to access the content that you're paying for as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Leveraging Technology for Engagement and Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>

The creator developed an internal "Passport" technology to enhance engagement and sharing, specifically by tokenizing links in emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This allows forwarded emails to grant one-link-deep access to paid articles, encouraging the "second article sensation" and attracting new potential subscribers without hitting immediate paywalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This leverages the natural spread of information through email forwarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

Self-linking within articles, though sometimes a running joke, serves as an "ongoing sort of journal" to understand technology, highlight past insights, analyze mistakes, and show trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## The Creator's Autonomy in a Subscription Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>

The direct feedback loop of subscriptions allows creators to focus primarily on "keeping my subscribers happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This contrasts with traditional publishing where writers might not even see their "click numbers" and are forced to seek external validation on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The recurring revenue model is "really, really powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

The creator attributes their ability to maintain independence and not "pander" to their audience to being "so early" in the subscription space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This allowed them to reach a large enough audience to be less sensitive to individual cancellations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Early on, the content itself was not controversial (e.g., arguing against the consensus that [[evolution_of_facebook_and_meta | Apple]] was doomed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, which helped in building an audience before needing to address more contentious topics.

Amazon's approach to technology was always viewed as an investment, not a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This perspective contrasts with the common belief that Amazon Web Services (AWS) originated from selling off surplus server capacity.

## The Excess Capacity Myth

A widely held, yet untrue, origin story for AWS is the "excess capacity narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This story suggests that around 2001-2003, Amazon.com, being a highly seasonal retail business with huge traffic spikes in Q4 for the holiday season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, had excess technical infrastructure capacity during quarters one through three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The urban legend claims Amazon decided to rent out this unused capacity to other developers to turn a large expense into a revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

However, this narrative is incorrect for several reasons:

*   **Technical Impossibility in Pre-Cloud Era**: Before cloud computing, technology companies did not operate in a way that allowed easy sharing of infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Servers were highly customized and tightly coupled to specific applications, making it impossible for external parties to run their applications securely or easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Amazon.com's code base was literally installed on specific servers they owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Proprietary Hardware**: In the early 2000s, Amazon used Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Alpha servers, which were part of a highly bundled hardware-software platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These monolithic systems had massive markups and high gross margins for manufacturers like DEC, IBM, and Oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The shift to Linux and open-source operating systems later allowed companies to use various hardware and write their own applications, which reduced infrastructure costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> and helped save Amazon from a cost perspective during a tight cash period around 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This move to Linux and HP servers was a cost-saving measure, not a virtualization strategy for external customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Business Logic**: If AWS relied on excess capacity, Amazon would not be able to guarantee service to its AWS customers during Q4 when its retail business needed the servers for peak demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This would be an unsustainable business model, especially for critical services like Netflix streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

> Werner Vogels, who was CTO of AWS at the time and is now CTO of all of Amazon, directly debunked this myth in a Quora post in 2011:
> "The excess capacity story is a myth. It was never a matter of selling excess capacity. Actually, within two months after launch, AWS would have already burned through the excess amazon.com [capacity]... Amazon Web Services was always considered a business by itself with the expectation that it could even grow as big as the amazon.com retail operation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>

## Technology as an Intentional Investment

The excess capacity myth "short-sells Amazon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> and does not give the company enough credit for its [[amazon_and_aws_business_strategy_intentions | intentionality and strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Technology was never seen as a cost center for Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Instead, it was always viewed as an investment, anticipating future capabilities with advancements like Moore's law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

The creation of AWS was an "incredibly intentional strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a> focused on creating a new emerging market, demonstrating Amazon's deliberate and forward-thinking approach to its technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

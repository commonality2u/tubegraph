The [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | Semiconductor Industry and TSMC]] has been a central focus of study, leading to an interview with Dr. Morris Chang, the 93-year-old founder of [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The discussion highlights crucial stories from his memoir, focusing on relationships with companies like Apple and [[challenges_and_competition_facing_nvidia_in_the_tech_industry | Nvidia]], and the emergence of the fabless industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Early Customer Relationships and Strategic Partnerships

### The NVIDIA Partnership
Dr. Chang's relationship with Jensen Huang, CEO of [[challenges_and_competition_facing_nvidia_in_the_tech_industry | Nvidia]], began with a letter in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. At the time, [[challenges_and_competition_facing_nvidia_in_the_tech_industry | Nvidia]] was a small, four-year-old company facing bankruptcy with 50-60 employees, while [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] was a relatively large company with over a billion USD in revenue by 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Despite initial unresponsiveness from [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s San Jose office, Dr. Chang was irritated by the oversight and personally contacted Jensen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Jensen impressed him with his articulateness and optimism, predicting that their new chip would not only save [[challenges_and_competition_facing_nvidia_in_the_tech_industry | Nvidia]] but also make them a major [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This prediction came true; within two to three years, [[challenges_and_competition_facing_nvidia_in_the_tech_industry | Nvidia]] became one of [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s top five biggest customers due to the success of their game chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Challenges with the 40-nanometer Node
In 2009, while Dr. Chang had stepped back from the CEO role, [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] faced significant manufacturing and quality issues with the 40-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This "yield problem" affected all customers, with [[challenges_and_competition_facing_nvidia_in_the_tech_industry | Nvidia]] being perhaps the biggest customer for that node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Upon returning as CEO in 2009, Dr. Chang prioritized resolving this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. After weeks of work, he formulated an offer of over $100 million in compensation to [[challenges_and_competition_facing_nvidia_in_the_tech_industry | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. He presented this offer to Jensen Huang during a private dinner at Jensen's home, with a 48-hour deadline for acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. Jensen accepted, reinforcing a strong partnership that has since generated many billions of dollars in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

### The Apple Breakthrough
[[customer_retention_and_acquisition_strategies_in_the_semiconductor_industry | Customer retention and acquisition strategies in the semiconductor industry]] with Apple was different. Apple, a "close-mouthed company," would only engage when they were ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>. The opportunity arose when Terry Gou, founder of Foxconn (a key supplier to Apple), arranged a dinner where Apple's COO, Jeff Williams, was present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Williams pitched [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] to produce their wafers, suggesting a 40% gross margin, which was lower than [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s current 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.

A major challenge emerged when Apple requested development for the 20-nanometer node, a "half-step" detour from [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s planned progression from 28-nanometer to 16-nanometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. At the time, [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s R&D resources could not handle two nodes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. Despite the substantial capital expenditure already committed to 28-nanometer (without Apple in mind) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>, Apple's demand required even more investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>.

Dr. Chang, after financial planning with Goldman Sachs, decided to borrow money and take only half of Apple's requested order to avoid cutting dividends or issuing new stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. Apple's purchasing team initially reacted with disbelief, but Jeff Williams accepted the prudent financial decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:39">[01:30:39]</a>.

The partnership faced a test when Intel approached Apple. Despite Intel's historical dominance, Dr. Chang was not overly worried, as Intel was no longer the imposing competitor it once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>. Tim Cook reassured Dr. Chang by stating, "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This was interpreted as Intel's lack of customer trust and willingness to respond courteously to every request, unlike [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

A significant tradeoff of pursuing the 20-nanometer node for Apple was delaying [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s 16-nanometer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. This allowed Samsung to take the lead in 16-nanometer, even securing Apple's initial orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>. Dr. Chang was shocked but was reassured by Jeff Williams that Apple would buy all their 16-nanometer needs once [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>. This proved true, with most of Apple's 16-nanometer requirements eventually going to [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>.

## Strategic Financial and Organizational Decisions

### The R&D Commitment
Having experienced R&D budget denials at Texas Instruments, Dr. Chang wanted to set a fixed percentage of revenue for R&D at [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] to avoid annual arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Upon his return in 2009, he arbitrarily chose 8% of revenue for R&D, regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. This decision was "the best thing that we did for R&D" as it provided stability and propelled [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s efforts, especially in the 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

### Capital Expenditure and the "Sweet Spot"
Beyond R&D, [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] significantly increased capital expenditures from around $2-2.5 billion annually to almost $6 billion in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. This was driven by the R&D team's conviction that 28-nanometer would be the "sweet spot" for market demand, coinciding with the rise of the smartphone era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. This massive investment, though met with questions from the board, was a calculated "bet the company" move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. Dr. Chang, citing Shakespeare, recognized it as a "tide in the affairs of man which taken at its flood leads on to fortune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.

### Organizational Structure
In 2005-2009, [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s operations were split into "advanced technology" and "mainstream technology" groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. Mainstream technology focuses on older, higher nanometer nodes for applications like automotive parts or CMOS sensors, keeping older fabs utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. Dr. Chang believed this divisional structure was unsuitable for a foundry business due to shared customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>. Upon his return as CEO, he combined the two operational groups and sought a strong business development/marketing leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. The role was eventually accepted by C.C. Wei, who is now the chairman and CEO of [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>.

### Employee Management
Dr. Chang strongly opposed layoffs based on performance reviews, a practice he considered subjective and disrespectful to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. In his view, a company should not lay off employees if it expects to rehire them within a year, considering the high separation and training costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:18">[02:08:18]</a>. He had always advocated for probation periods and transfers instead of outright firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>. After his return, he rehired laid-off employees and even faced protests at his home, which his wife resolved by bringing breakfast to the protesters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:12">[02:09:12]</a>.

## The Learning Curve and Market Dynamics

Dr. Chang's deep understanding of the learning curve theory, refined during his time at Texas Instruments with Bruce Henderson and Bill Bain, was fundamental to [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:19">[02:02:19]</a>.

> "The simple explanation of learning curve is that as you make more of one thing, anything, actually started with refrigerators and the cars, you know, if a company makes more cars, then its cost per per car unit cost goes down. That's why it's also called experience curve. You gain more experience, you become more efficient." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>

This theory emphasizes that the goal is to become the largest volume player to achieve the lowest unit costs through economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>. This involves accelerating pricing, even starting unprofitably, to outcompete rivals and capture market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:50">[02:38:50]</a>.

## The Rise of the Fabless Model

Dr. Chang foresaw the emergence of "fabless" companies—those that design chips but do not manufacture them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>. This was confirmed by early interactions, such as Gordon Campbell seeking funding for a company without a fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:35">[02:18:35]</a>. The [[the_evolution_of_the_semiconductor_industry | evolution of the semiconductor industry]] towards a dedicated pure-play foundry model was a strategic bet for [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>.

### Qualcomm and IBM
[[customer_retention_and_acquisition_strategies_in_the_semiconductor_industry | Customer retention and acquisition strategies in the semiconductor industry]] was exemplified by [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s long pursuit of Qualcomm as a customer, recognizing them as a technology house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:50">[01:55:50]</a>. Qualcomm, founded before [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:35">[01:56:35]</a>, initially gave [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] very little business, relying mainly on IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:38">[01:57:38]</a>. However, in the late 1990s (around 1997-1998), Qualcomm's business with [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] rapidly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>. This indicated to Dr. Chang that IBM Semiconductor was in trouble, as Qualcomm was a major client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:41">[01:58:41]</a>.

Consequently, IBM's request for [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] to co-develop the next generation (.13 Micron or 130 nanometer) in 1999 was not a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:46">[01:59:46]</a>. [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] declined, as co-development under IBM's terms would mean losing their own process development capabilities and being dependent on a "senior partner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:30">[02:00:30]</a>. IBM, angered by the refusal, then approached UMC, which accepted but later regretted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>. By 1999, UMC was already smaller than [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>.

## Ecosystem and Future Outlook

The success of [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]] and the broader semiconductor industry in Taiwan is attributed to the Hsinchu Science Park, a government-funded initiative that fosters a tightly integrated ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:45">[02:27:45]</a>. This park houses [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]], its partners, customers (like Qualcomm and MediaTek), and even two universities that feed PhDs directly into the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:03">[02:28:03]</a>. This close geographic proximity facilitates intense [[collaborative_innovation_in_the_semiconductor_industry | collaborative innovation in the semiconductor industry]] and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:33">[02:29:33]</a>.

[[tsmcs_impact_on_global_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC's impact on global semiconductor manufacturing]] is evident in its ability to consistently ride the "ridiculous tailwind" of Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Since [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s founding in 1987, the world's semiconductor market has grown from $26 billion to $527 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:47">[02:45:47]</a>. The continuous demand for more computing power, doubling every two years, drives the need for massive capital investment in fabs (now costing tens of billions of dollars) and R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:41">[02:44:41]</a>. This creates a natural monopoly characteristic, where leaders can invest more than competitors, further solidifying their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>. The integration of proprietary packaging technologies, such as CoWoS for AI chips, further locks in customers and reinforces [[semiconductor_industry_and_tsmc | TSMC]]'s leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:12">[02:43:12]</a>.

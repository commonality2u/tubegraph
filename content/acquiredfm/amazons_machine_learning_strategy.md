Machine learning (ML) is considered a massive pillar of [[amazons_business_strategies_and_innovations | Amazon's business]], alongside computing and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While databases are not as critical as compute, they are important for customer stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Amazon's ML Offerings

[[amazons_business_strategies_and_innovations | Amazon]] has significantly invested in ML, demonstrating this through:
*   The announcement of SageMaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   The introduction of a custom ML keynote at their events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   A wide range of [[amazons_cloudhosted_ml_services | cloud-hosted ML offerings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   Support for TensorFlow, a technology originally created by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Providing their own Amazon Container Service (ECS) and an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). While catering to customer demand for Kubernetes, the aim is to encourage the use of their custom ECS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Machine Learning

### Data Gravity as a Key Advantage

Amazon's strategy with machine learning hinges on the principle of data gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Running ML near the data is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Once a customer chooses [[amazons_transition_to_a_technology_company | Amazon]] as their storage vendor and migrates their data to [[awss_approach_to_cloud_computing_and_technology_strategy | AWS]] data centers, they are unlikely to seek ML services elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Consequently, customers will naturally run their ML workloads on [[awss_approach_to_cloud_computing_and_technology_strategy | AWS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Comparison of Amazons ML capabilities with Googles

Amazon's ML capabilities, while needing to be proficient, do not necessarily need to surpass those of Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Although Google might be better positioned to offer superior ML services, this advantage diminishes if customers are not storing their data with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, [[amazons_business_strategies_and_innovations | Amazon]] cannot afford to fall significantly behind in ML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

Epic Systems is a prominent, yet quiet, company based in rural Wisconsin that plays an enormous role in American healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While many people may know them through their medical patient software, My Chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, Epic is highly unusual in its business practices. The company does no marketing, little to no sales, often declines potential customers, does not negotiate or discount, has never raised venture capital, and has made no acquisitions in its 47-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Furthermore, it operates entirely in-person on a single, uniquely designed campus in Verona, Wisconsin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>.

Epic's software is used by the majority of major U.S. hospital systems, and out of over 600 customers, it has never permanently lost a single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The company remains privately held, with founder Judy Faulkner and her family foundation owning approximately half of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. With close to $6 billion in annual revenue and over 14,000 employees, Epic has a stated goal to never go public or be acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Faulkner has established a succession plan and trust structure to ensure this remains true forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Foundational Principles and Early Development

Judy Faulkner's journey began with an interest in math and a self-taught proficiency in Fortran in the mid-1960s, a time when computer science was still emerging as a field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. While pursuing a PhD in computer science at the University of Wisconsin (UW), she took a pioneering course called "Computers in Medicine" taught by Dr. Warner Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. This led to her working on programs for UW Medical School, initially optimizing on-call schedules for doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.

Through this work, Faulkner identified a critical need across different hospital departments: a single, centralized database for patient records that could track care longitudinally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. This vision was spurred by the fragmented, paper-based nature of medical records at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. The creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 further highlighted the need for standardized documentation for billing purposes, as third-party payers required proof of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>.

Faulkner learned about MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System), a specialized programming language and integrated database developed for early computerized medical record systems like Co-Star at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:19">[02:30:19]</a>. Inspired, she had an epiphany in the mid-1970s and began writing the code for "Chronicles," a single, integrated database designed to track a patient's care journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:50">[02:33:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:18">[02:34:18]</a>. Chronicles remains the core of Epic's system today, serving as the singular database that all of Epic's applications pull from, including clinical, billing, and specialized modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:38">[02:34:38]</a>. This single-database architecture is a key differentiator for Epic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:10">[02:54:10]</a>.

Initially, Chronicles was used internally at UW Medical Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:24">[02:36:24]</a>. However, demand spread virally as UW doctors shared their positive experiences with colleagues at other academic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:50">[02:36:50]</a>. Despite initial reluctance, Faulkner eventually founded Human Services Computing in 1979 (renamed Epic Systems in 1983) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:21">[02:37:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. The company was started with a $70,000 bank loan for a mini-computer and another $70,000 in equity from friends and family, and these were the *only* primary investors Epic ever had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:39">[02:41:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>. This capital-light approach was enabled by Faulkner's exceptional programming talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:47">[02:43:47]</a>.

Epic initially focused on complex academic training hospitals, which had the necessary Unix-based infrastructure for their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:53">[02:50:53]</a>. In 1987, Epic launched Resolute, their billing module, addressing the critical financial needs of hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:40">[02:53:40]</a>. This integration of clinical and billing data on a single codebase became a significant competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:05">[02:55:05]</a>. In 1992, Epicare, a Windows-based graphical user interface (GUI) EMR application, was launched, making the software more accessible to everyday medical staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:47">[02:57:47]</a>. My Chart, an internet-based patient portal, debuted in 2000, allowing patients direct access to their medical records and facilitating self-scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:40">[03:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:54">[03:06:54]</a>. This was considered "insanely innovative" for its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:58">[03:21:58]</a>. The inpatient version of Epicare launched in 2001, completing the integrated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:14">[03:11:14]</a>.

## The Role of Policy and Market Dominance

Epic's trajectory significantly accelerated with the Kaiser Permanente deal in 2003. Kaiser, the largest single hospital system in the U.S. at the time, chose Epic for its system-wide EMR, a deal that reportedly valued at $4 billion overall with Epic's portion around $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:18">[03:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:34">[03:13:34]</a>. This transformed Epic's revenue from $50 million to $162 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:52">[03:22:52]</a>. Epic won this despite being much smaller than its main competitor, Cerner, primarily due to its integrated architecture and proven reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:15">[03:28:15]</a>. Epic's firm stance against splitting the system between ambulatory and inpatient components, unlike Cerner, ultimately proved decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:30">[03:22:30]</a>.

The passage of the HITECH Act (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act) in 2009, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, further solidified Epic's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:50">[02:14:50]</a>. This legislation offered $27 billion in direct incentives to hospitals for adopting EHRs and penalized those that didn't meet "meaningful use" criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:09">[02:15:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:44">[02:16:44]</a>. This led to market penetration of EHRs increasing from 9% of hospitals in 2009 to 95% by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:27">[02:19:27]</a>. Epic, as the most reliable and integrated solution, greatly benefited from this government-driven mandate, as hospitals preferred a system that was "100% going to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:13">[02:18:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:20">[02:18:20]</a>.

While the HITECH Act succeeded in digitizing the industry, it did not significantly reduce costs or improve data interoperability as much as hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:28">[02:25:28]</a>. It also inadvertently increased administrative burdens on doctors due to stringent compliance requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:30">[02:24:30]</a>. However, it laid the foundation for future digital innovation.

## Epic's Unique Culture and Operating Model

Epic's culture is deeply influenced by Judy Faulkner's personality, blending whimsical creativity with a "hard driving win at all costs" performance ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:52">[01:37:52]</a>. The company operates as a "software factory," turning developers into medical code and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

Key aspects of Epic's culture and operating model include:
*   **No Public or Acquisitions:** Embedded in their "ten commandments" posted throughout the campus, stating they will never go public, be acquired, or acquire other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>. This commitment builds trust with customers, assuring them of a stable, integrated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>.
*   **Customer Obsession:** Epic is intensely customer-focused, specifically on hospital CEOs, CIOs, and CFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:24">[01:52:24]</a>. They prioritize reliability and delivering on promises, ensuring their software "just works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>. Every customer has dedicated technical specialists and a "Best Friend Forever" (BFF) who ensures their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:16">[01:54:16]</a>. They even provide report cards to customers benchmarking their performance against peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:48">[01:54:48]</a>.
*   **Internal Development & Standardization:** Epic builds all its systems in-house and spends 35% of its operating expenses on research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:50">[03:19:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. They strongly encourage customers to use standard implementations, offering discounts for doing so, to maintain system integrity and ease updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:40">[02:55:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:24">[02:56:24]</a>.
*   **Hiring & Training:** Epic primarily hires smart, young college graduates from diverse majors, operating on the assumption that they can learn healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:54">[02:48:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:55">[02:49:55]</a>. They implement rigorous training and a prescriptive software methodology that emphasizes a "zero-bug environment" due to the critical nature of healthcare data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:43">[02:45:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:26">[02:46:26]</a>. Every developer must fix their own bugs immediately to maintain context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:16">[02:46:16]</a>. Employees are required to spend time in clinical settings to observe workflows directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:07">[02:45:07]</a>.

## Competitive Landscape and Strategic Advantages

Epic's single-database architecture and integrated clinical-billing systems provide a robust and reliable platform, which is a major competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:10">[02:54:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:05">[02:55:05]</a>. This contrasts sharply with competitors like Cerner (now [[arms_business_model_and_licensing_strategy | Oracle Health]]), which grew through numerous acquisitions, resulting in complex, less integrated systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:28">[02:54:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:15">[03:28:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Epic's primary competitive powers include:
*   **Switching Costs:** Given that an EMR system acts as the "nervous system" for a hospital, implementation costs hundreds of millions to billions of dollars, making switching to a different vendor incredibly difficult and risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:06">[03:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:54">[03:12:54]</a>.
*   **Scale Economies:** Epic's large customer base allows it to amortize significant R&D investments across many clients, enabling them to develop extensive product breadth and offer new modules, often for free, to existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:20">[03:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:51">[03:23:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:58">[03:23:58]</a>.
*   **Network Economies:** The widespread adoption of Epic (79% of the U.S. population is seen in an Epic system) creates network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:04">[03:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:07">[03:01:07]</a>. Hospitals prefer Epic because it simplifies data exchange (via Care Everywhere) with other Epic hospitals and because most new doctors and nurses are trained on Epic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:52">[02:56:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:59">[03:16:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:27">[03:46:27]</a>.
*   **Branding:** Epic is perceived as the gold standard in the industry, particularly by prestigious institutions, making it the default choice for new implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:48">[03:17:48]</a>.
*   **Process Power:** Epic's unique development methodology, use of MUMPS/Cache, and rigorous employee training create a proprietary knowledge base and operational efficiency that are difficult for competitors to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:21">[03:18:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:50">[03:18:50]</a>.

Epic's philosophy led them to famously refuse an equity stake in a deal with Kaiser Permanente, and they were also largely "unburdened" by the sprawling, troubled U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs EHR contracts that Cerner won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:40">[03:26:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>. This allowed Epic to maintain its focus and continue winning large hospital system deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:47">[03:44:47]</a>.

## Future Prospects and Challenges

Epic, with $5.7 billion in revenue in 2024 (13% year-over-year growth over the last 5 years), is looking to expand its reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:14">[03:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:21">[03:01:21]</a>. While their average customer generates about $10 million in annual revenue, Epic only captures a minority of the total healthcare IT spend by hospitals, suggesting potential pricing headroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:40">[03:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:14">[03:02:14]</a>.

Growth vectors include:
*   **International Expansion:** Epic is gaining traction in international markets, with notable implementations like London's Guys and St. Thomas' NHS Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:23">[03:50:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:28">[03:50:28]</a>.
*   **Consolidation of Healthcare Systems:** The ongoing consolidation of smaller medical practices into larger hospital systems, partly driven by increased compliance burdens from acts like the Affordable Care Act, benefits Epic's strategy of serving large, complex institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:02">[03:51:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:13">[03:52:13]</a>.
*   **Expanding to New Customer Types:** Epic is leveraging its scale to offer products and services to other key players in the healthcare ecosystem, such as payers (insurance companies) and pharmaceutical companies, through initiatives like the "grid of care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:10">[03:53:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:32">[03:53:32]</a>. An example is automating prior authorizations, a major point of friction in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:51">[03:53:51]</a>.
*   **Data Monetization (Cosmos):** Epic launched Cosmos, a vast, anonymized database containing data from 295 million patients and 15 billion individual patient encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:04">[02:56:04]</a>. This resource, currently free for contributing institutions, offers immense potential for research, clinical trials, and identifying patterns in patient care, addressing the utopian dream of utilizing aggregated health data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:51">[02:57:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>.
*   **AI Integration:** The rise of AI, particularly ambient listening AI scribes, offers a significant opportunity to alleviate doctor burnout by automating data entry during patient interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:10">[03:38:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:34">[03:39:34]</a>. Epic is partnering with companies like Microsoft/Nuance, Abridge, and Suki, and may develop its own solutions, becoming the "choke point" for AI innovations reaching hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:51">[03:39:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:04">[03:40:04]</a>.

Potential bear cases for Epic include challenges in international markets due to lower willingness to pay, ongoing antitrust lawsuits (such as with Particle Health) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:49">[03:24:49]</a>, and the impact of information blocking legislation like the Cures Act, which mandates access to information and could facilitate data extraction from Epic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:11">[03:32:11]</a>. However, the high switching costs and Epic's existing dominance make it unlikely that these would fundamentally disrupt its position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:51">[03:32:51]</a>.

## Analysis of Power

Epic's success can be largely attributed to its unique approach to the vertical market software industry. Unlike horizontal software, where listening too closely to individual customers can lead to fragmented products, vertical software benefits from deep integration and customization for a specific user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:51">[03:44:51]</a>. In healthcare, the high stakes (patient lives, complex regulations, severe penalties for mistakes) make a single, highly reliable, integrated vendor like Epic invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:18">[03:46:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:40">[03:46:40]</a>.

Epic's playbook demonstrates:
*   **Compounding R&D:** By spending heavily on R&D and eschewing sales/marketing and acquisitions, Epic has built a product that compounds its competitive advantage over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:09">[03:21:09]</a>.
*   **"Hill Climbing" Growth:** Judy Faulkner's philosophy of focusing on the "next hill" rather than seeing the whole "mountain" aligns with the idea of continuous, iterative growth, discovering new opportunities adjacent to existing successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:28">[03:22:28]</a>. This enabled Epic to grow organically and build "bulletproof" systems over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:21">[03:48:21]</a>.
*   **Founder Continuity:** Judy Faulkner's continuous leadership for 47 years has allowed her unique personality and principles to deeply imbue the company's culture and strategy, a rare and powerful factor in long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>. Her dedication to keeping Epic private and controlled by a purpose trust ensures its long-term vision and resistance to external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:51">[03:09:51]</a>.

Epic's estimated valuation, if it were public, could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars due to its extreme durability, dominant market position, and strategic value, particularly given the potential of its vast data assets in the era of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:31">[03:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:50">[03:08:50]</a>. This makes Judy Faulkner arguably the most successful female entrepreneur in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:37">[03:07:37]</a>.

Mars Incorporated, the parent company of brands like M&M's and Snickers, has grown into a $50 billion annual revenue enterprise, making it one of the top five largest privately owned companies in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20">[03:20]</a>. Its corporate strategy over the years has been as clever as that of companies like LVMH, Walmart, and Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27">[02:27]</a>. The company's story is deeply intertwined with its founder, Frank Clarence Mars, and his son, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09">[06:09]</a>.

## Early Beginnings and Challenges

Frank Mars began his journey in the candy business as an entrepreneur at 19, establishing his first company in Minneapolis in 1902 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35">[08:35]</a>. At this time, the candy market consisted largely of unbranded "Penny Candy" made from sugar, with chocolate not yet a significant presence in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24">[07:24]</a>. This early venture, along with two subsequent candy businesses in Seattle and Tacoma, failed due to issues like perishability and limited market size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44">[10:44]</a>.

In 1920, Frank returned to Minneapolis and started his fourth candy company, which would eventually become the globally renowned Mars Incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15">[13:15]</a>. This time, the focus shifted to chocolate, a relatively new and complex product in the American market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35">[13:35]</a>. His first notable success was the Milky Way bar, introduced in 1924, which generated $800,000 in sales in its first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:46">[49:46]</a>. This growth was attributed to adopting mechanical production methods, setting them apart from many regional, handmade candy operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:08">[50:08]</a>.

## The Influence of [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]]

[[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]], Frank's estranged son, rejoined his father's life in 1923 and played a pivotal role in the company's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27">[42:27]</a>. After graduating from Yale, where he studied business and gained insights into industrial manufacturing from Pierre S. duPont's nephew, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] brought a strategic mindset to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:35">[56:35]</a>.

He advocated for moving the company to Chicago, a hub for the candy industry with better freight distribution, to facilitate national expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:29">[57:29]</a>. Under his influence, the Chicago factory adopted state-of-the-art production lines, running 24/7 to maximize output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:49">[59:49]</a>. By 1929, they were producing 20 million Milky Way bars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. In 1930, the Snickers bar, named after Frank's favorite horse, was introduced, quickly becoming a popular product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

Despite the Great Depression, Mars's revenue soared to $25 million by 1932, largely due to their focus on scale, low pricing, and broad distribution, making candy an accessible treat for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.

### Europe and Diversification

In 1932, due to differing ambitions with his father, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] left the US with $50,000 and the foreign rights to the Milky Way recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. He moved to Switzerland to learn chocolate manufacturing from experts like Jean Tobler and Nestle, working directly on factory lines without revealing his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.

In 1933, he established a small factory in Slough, England, where he produced the Mars Bar, an adaptation of the Milky Way recipe for British tastes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. By 1939, Mars UK became the third-largest candy company in Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>.

[[product_expansion_and_market_exploration | Product expansion and market exploration]] was a key part of [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]]'s strategy. In 1934, he acquired Chapel Brothers, a small British company making canned dog food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>. This marked Mars's early diversification into pet food, an entirely new industry at the time, which quickly became profitable and funded further expansion of the Mars Bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>.

### The Mars Principles

During this period in England, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] established the core principles that would define Mars's culture:
*   **Quality:** Obsession with quality at every dimension, implementing a "Toyota production system" where any employee could stop the line for defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:04">[01:29:04]</a>. Quality was tied to "value for money," aiming to offer superior quality at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.
*   **Responsibility:** Empowering employees by paying them significantly higher wages (three to four times the norm) and linking bonuses to overall company performance, not individual metrics (except for punctuality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:11">[01:32:11]</a>. All employees were called "associates," and there were no executive perks or private offices, fostering an open and equal environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>.
*   **Mutuality:** Ensuring that all partners in the ecosystem—retailers, suppliers, distributors—also benefited and were incentivized for long-term relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** A strong focus on "Return on Total Assets" (ROTA), a metric championed by TG Rose's book *Higher Control in Management* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>. [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] aimed for an 18% ROTA, meaning every investment needed to pay for itself in less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:34">[01:40:34]</a>. Mars achieved high output per worker and aggressively reinvested profits into R&D for manufacturing equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>.
*   **Freedom:** Maintaining private family ownership, avoiding debt, and being extremely private about the company's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>.

## Return to America and M&M's Success

In 1939, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] returned to the US, bringing with him the concept of dragées—chocolate pieces coated with a hard candy shell to prevent melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:24">[01:49:24]</a>. This led to a joint venture with William Murray, president of Hershey, to create M&M's, with an 80/20 ownership split in favor of [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:30">[01:57:30]</a>. The timing was strategic: the US entered World War II shortly after production began in 1941, and M&M's, like Hershey's bars during WWI, became a significant ration for the military, boosting early sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:42">[02:01:42]</a>. Hershey's exclusive chocolate supply contract with the military provided a critical advantage, as they supplied M&M's Limited Partnership while limiting supply to other wholesale customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:10">[02:02:10]</a>.

Concurrently, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] further diversified by co-founding a company in Houston, Texas, in 1942, to produce parboiled rice, a more nutritious and faster-cooking grain, primarily for the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>. This product eventually became Uncle Ben's Rice (now Ben's Original), generating over a billion dollars in annual revenue today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>.

After the war, M&M's faced challenges in the consumer market, leading [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] to eventually buy out his partner, Bruce Murray, for $1 million in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. In 1950, he commissioned Ted Bates and Company for a comprehensive market study, which revealed M&M's strong appeal to children, despite the market trending towards adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>. This led to the iconic slogan, "The milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand," brilliantly appealing to parents by promising less mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:54">[02:15:54]</a>. Combined with sponsorships of popular children's TV shows like *The Mickey Mouse Club*, M&M's became the biggest-selling candy in America by 1956, surpassing even Hershey's bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:45">[02:17:45]</a>.

## Reclaiming Mars Inc. and Global Dominance

After his stepmother's passing, [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] began a decades-long quest to gain full control of his father's company, Mars Inc. Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:28">[02:25:28]</a>. By 1964, he achieved this, consolidating all his diverse businesses under the Mars Incorporated umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:49">[02:28:49]</a>. He immediately implemented his management principles, tearing down office walls, selling executive perks, and emphasizing ROTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

A pivotal strategic move was [[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]]'s decision to bring chocolate manufacturing in-house in America, phasing out purchases from Hershey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This move, despite Hershey's predictions of it taking 10 years to become profitable, enhanced quality control and enabled greater scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>.

Mars capitalized on Hershey's outdated pricing strategy, which kept its bar at a nickel from 1900 to 1969, leading to significant bar shrinkage due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:21">[02:40:21]</a>. In response to Hershey finally raising prices and trying to re-increase bar size, Mars launched a price and size war, increasing their own bar sizes while maintaining prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:17">[02:44:17]</a>. By 1973, the combined Mars (including M&M's and original Mars Inc. products) surpassed Hershey to become the number one candy company in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>.

## Global Market [[product_expansion_and_market_exploration | Product Expansion and Market Exploration]]

[[forest_mars_and_his_business_strategies | Forest Mars]] retired in 1973, leaving the company to his three children: Forest Jr., John, and Jackie Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>. During their tenure, the company grew from $800 million to $20 billion in revenue by 2001, largely driven by global expansion into markets like Japan, China, Russia, the Middle East, and South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:26">[02:55:26]</a>. They also unified product brands globally, making Snickers a consistent name worldwide, and engaged in large-scale sponsorships like the Olympics, following a similar playbook to [[visas_growth_strategies_and_future_challenges | Visa's growth strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:49">[02:55:49]</a>.

Key product introductions and acquisitions during this period included:
*   Skittles (1974) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:11">[02:54:11]</a>
*   Twix and Starburst (from the UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:17">[02:54:17]</a>
*   Kal Kan Foods (1986), expanding the pet food business in America, leading to brands like Pedigree and Whiskas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:27">[02:54:27]</a>.
*   Dove bars and chocolates (1986) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:40">[02:54:40]</a>.

In 2008, Mars acquired the Wrigley company for $23 billion, with financial assistance from Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:05">[02:59:05]</a>. This acquisition added leading gum and mint brands like Altoids and Lifesavers to Mars's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:50">[03:04:50]</a>.

Mars also expanded its pet care business beyond food by acquiring stakes in and eventually fully owning pet hospital chains like Banfield Pet Hospital (starting in 2007) and VCA (2017) for $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:08">[03:05:08]</a>. This strategy integrates manufacturing (Royal Canin prescription pet food, acquired 2002) with service delivery, establishing Mars as a dominant player in the veterinary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:43">[03:06:43]</a>.

More recently, Mars acquired Kind Bar for $5 billion in 2020, after an initial partial investment, expanding their healthier snack offerings and taking the brand global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:43">[03:09:43]</a>.

## Current Strategy and Market Position

In August, Mars announced a definitive agreement to acquire Kellanova (Kellogg's snack businesses and international cereal, excluding American cereal) for $35.9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This move will significantly expand Mars's snack portfolio with brands like Rice Krispy Treats, Pringles, Eggo, Pop-Tarts, and RXBAR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:34">[03:11:34]</a>.

As of 2023, Mars reported over $50 billion in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:16">[03:14:16]</a>. While the candy business (Mars Snacking) accounts for $18 billion, the Pet Care segment is the dominant component, representing 59% of revenue and employing nearly 100,000 of Mars's 140,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:50">[03:14:50]</a>. In the US, Mars and Hershey each hold about 24% of the candy and confections market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:47">[03:15:47]</a>. Globally, Mars is the largest candy company with 11% market share in a fragmented industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>.

Mars's long-term success is built on:
*   **Scale Economies:** Operating at high gross margins in large markets, amortizing massive fixed costs over huge sales volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:11">[03:18:11]</a>.
*   **Branding:** Leveraging strong brand recognition and trust to drive sales volume and recurring purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
*   **Conglomeration:** Successfully managing diverse businesses (candy, pet care, food) and geographies through a decentralized operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:52">[03:35:52]</a>.
*   **Duration:** Consistently growing revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 14% for a century, driven by global applicability, efficient operations, and habitual consumer purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:07">[03:37:07]</a>.

Mars is acutely aware of external challenges, particularly the impact of climate change on cacao production and the rising concern about sugar consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:14">[03:33:14]</a>. These factors are driving ongoing diversification into healthier snacks and the robust pet care sector.

The **Invest America initiative** is a concept championed by Brad Gerstner, founder of Altimeter Capital, aimed at addressing the wealth divide and fostering broader participation in the American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:27">[01:35:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Gerstner views this initiative as a way to "make everybody feel like they're part of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>.

## Rationale and Purpose

Gerstner notes that while the industrial revolution was largely an equalizer, the technology revolution naturally tends towards wealth concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>. This is evident as only about 30% of Americans belong to the "ownership society" by participating in the public stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>. He emphasizes his disdain for accredited investor laws, which he believes "rigged the game so only rich people can invest in the best companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:42">[01:38:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:53">[01:38:53]</a>.

The initiative aims to:
*   **Encourage Risk-Takers:** Create a system where the risk of entrepreneurship doesn't lead to personal ruin, unlike past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:58">[01:43:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:44">[01:48:44]</a>.
*   **Promote Inclusion:** Ensure that every child in the country owns a "tiny little slice" of major American companies like Apple, Walmart, Tesla, and the future SpaceX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:17">[01:42:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:22">[01:42:22]</a>.
*   **Foster Financial Literacy:** Educate individuals, starting with sixth graders, about stocks and the concept of wealth compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:41">[01:43:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:47">[01:43:47]</a>.
*   **Drive Innovation:** Support the capitalist system which, despite its flaws, is seen as an enabler for progress and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:56">[01:47:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:56">[01:49:56]</a>.

## Core Mechanics

The central idea involves establishing an "Invest America account" for every child born in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.

*   **Account Funding:** The government would fund these accounts based on means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>. For instance, families making over $200,000 annually might receive $100, while those under a certain threshold could receive $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>. Parents could also contribute up to $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:09">[01:40:09]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Investment:** The money would compound at an estimated 6-7% for 50 years, potentially becoming worth $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:23">[01:40:23]</a>. Funds could not be withdrawn until a long time down the line, ensuring it functions as a retirement program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:47">[01:42:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:54">[01:42:54]</a>.
*   **Educational Impact:** The initiative would aim to teach children about investing, with leaders like Seth Klarman of Baupost offering to write the curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:05">[01:44:05]</a>.
*   **Cost and Feasibility:** Gerstner estimates the annual cost to the federal government at less than $20 billion, which he considers a "drop in the bucket" compared to other stimulus plans or defense spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>.

## Expected Outcomes

Gerstner believes the psychological impact of feeling ownership in the system would "dwarf the amount of money that's in that account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:36">[01:45:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:40">[01:45:40]</a>. He anticipates it could dramatically change the trajectory of every child born in the country over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:25">[01:44:25]</a>.

He points to the success of platforms like Robinhood as evidence that widespread public interest in investing exists, even if those users initially had means to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:34">[01:44:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>.

> "If you give these kids a slice of America over a period of 40 or 50 years, it's going to be worth a hell of a lot more in the future than it is when they get it, but way more important is every day of their lives they will feel like they belong to the system, they're not on the outside looking in." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a>

Gerstner expresses optimism that the capital markets will become more vibrant and accessible, with more capital and ideas, and that innovation will accelerate in the coming decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:15">[01:47:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:19">[01:47:19]</a>. He envisions a future where an increasing percentage of investment dollars for funds like Altimeter Capital will come from "willing retail investors who want exposure to this incredible asset class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:55">[01:50:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:58">[01:50:58]</a>.

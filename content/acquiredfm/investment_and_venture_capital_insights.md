## Learning from Business History

A key aspect of [[insights_into_investing_and_business_development | investing and business development]] is the study of history. David Senra, host of the *Founders Podcast*, is deeply obsessed with business history and the lessons derived from great founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He has read hundreds of founder biographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This dedication to learning from the past is echoed by successful individuals.

Sam Zell, a prominent figure in business, did not simply build a company that sold for nearly $40 billion and then learn about history; he was studying it from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This concept aligns with basketball players like Kobe Bryant, who constantly watched "game tape" and worked on fundamentals from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Listening to podcasts like *Acquired* and *Founders* is akin to "watching game tape" on historical entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### The Value of Historical Study
Bill Gurley emphasized that while one doesn't have to be the smartest person, they can collect the most information, especially in the age of the internet where information is readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. He suggested that with intense study for about two years, one can become a domain expert, knowing more than almost anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. This perspective suggests that entrepreneurs and investors are "building machines" that convert knowledge into profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. A single idea from a book or podcast, if applied, can result in significant improvements, such as a $10 million impact for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

Charlie Munger famously stated that he made $400 million from reading *Barron's* for 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This was derived from one actionable idea, which earned him $50 million, and then that sum was given to Li Lu, who turned it into $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. This illustrates that learning from history provides a form of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Human nature remains constant, and those who ignore history risk making mistakes that have already been seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

Despite the deep knowledge gained from decades of experience, individuals like Sam Walton's wisdom is so vast that one might only capture 1% to 5% of it from reading a book or listening to a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. However, this small percentage still offers enormous leverage due to the time compression of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

## Characteristics of Successful Founders and Investors

Successful founders and investors, such as Charlie Munger, have always had "idols" and learned from those who came before them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. They view their competitors not as stupid, but as sources of the "very best insights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. They are "learning machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### The Role of Independent Thinking
Peter Thiel emphasizes that companies often overvalue growth rates and undervalue durability, despite the majority of profits for technology companies being 20 years in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. He argues that optimizing for durability first is crucial to collecting future profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

One of Steve Jobs's philosophies was, "Don't do anything someone else can do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>. This drive for differentiation is crucial for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, was relentlessly demanding about perfection and expanding his empire, even if it meant running over competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:21">[02:26:21]</a>. He was willing to destroy competitors who couldn't compete on his level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:44">[02:26:44]</a>.

## The Evolution of Investment and Venture Capital

### Shifting Paradigms in [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | Venture Capital]]
[[the_changing_landscape_of_venture_capital_and_technology_investments | Investing and venture capital]] is an "ancient business," but its execution evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:39">[01:35:39]</a>. JP Morgan's deal flow was relationship-based; one got in if they "knew somebody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. Similarly, Hedy Green, one of the richest women in America, built her wealth through a reputation for being the first person to go to during financial panics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:43">[01:37:43]</a>. She held a desk at Chemical Bank in Manhattan, leveraging her physical location at the center of finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:54">[01:37:54]</a>.

In today's environment, a crucial competitive advantage is to "have an edge" and "do something your competitors don't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:19">[01:38:19]</a>. This could involve deep research into business history, sharing knowledge to build a network, and leveraging platforms like podcasts for inbound deal flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>.

### Market Dynamics and [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | Strategies]]
In Q4 2021, [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | VC]] deployed almost $85 billion into private companies, but just 12 months later, in Q4 2022, that dropped to around $35 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>. The number of funds raising money decreased from 1,270 in 2021 to 769 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>. While this is a significant drop, the capital amount and number of funds are still astronomical compared to decades prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:23">[01:32:23]</a>.

By 2021, [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | VC]] Assets Under Management (AUM) peaked at about $2.6 trillion, but due to valuation declines, the net asset value is now estimated around $2 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:39">[01:32:39]</a>. Much of this AUM is committed dollars not yet called in capital calls from LPs, meaning the actual available cash (dry powder) is much smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

Despite market fluctuations, the aggregate brand and reputation of the [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | Venture Capital]] industry has declined rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:26">[01:51:26]</a>. This creates a challenge for [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | Venture Capital]] firms to differentiate themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:18">[01:52:18]</a>. Many founders now prefer to avoid [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | Venture Capital]] and build businesses outside that ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:48">[01:52:48]</a>.

From a founder's perspective, the "product" that founders are buying from [[the_concept_and_challenges_of_venture_capital | VCs]] is "improved odds" of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>. Founders are primarily concerned with whether an investment makes their company more likely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:43">[01:55:43]</a>. This involves more than just money; it includes networking and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:53">[01:55:53]</a>. Podcasting, for example, can reverse the dynamic of deal flow, turning outbound pitches into inbound interest from potential investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:54">[01:56:54]</a>.

### The Influence of Interest Rates on [[characteristics_and_appeal_of_venture_capital_investing | Investing]]
Warren Buffett stated that "interest rates power everything in the economic universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:58">[02:37:58]</a>. The value of every business, farm, or economic asset is 100% sensitive to interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:04">[02:38:04]</a>. This is because investing involves exchanging money now for a future stream of money, and higher interest rates reduce that present value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:15">[02:38:15]</a>. Buffett compared interest rates to gravity for asset prices: when rates are low, there's little gravitational pull on asset prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:33">[02:38:33]</a>. The period of zero interest rates created "bad habits" in the [[application_of_traditional_investing_principles_to_venture_capital | business]] world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:28">[02:36:28]</a>.

Historically, companies could not go public unless they had over $100 million in revenue and were profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:24">[02:35:24]</a>. In 2021, however, only a single-digit percentage of companies that went public were profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:34">[02:35:34]</a>.

## Key Principles of Success

### Cultivating an "Inner Clock"
Warren Buffett emphasizes the importance of an "inner score card" over an "outer score card," meaning doing things because one knows they are good, rather than seeking external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:27">[02:49:27]</a>. Charlie Munger states that he has always had an "inner clock," doing things because he wanted to, not to impress others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

### Embracing Opportunity and Risk
Ray Kroc's autobiography, *Grinding It Out*, illustrates that it's impossible to plan everything in advance; one must have faith or intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>. His journey from selling paper cups for 17 years to building McDonald's shows that opportunities emerge in complex and messy ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:30">[02:23:30]</a>.

Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs embodied this by being willing to "get jobs" if Apple didn't work out, essentially being "all in" because they had little to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>. The ethos of "there's no security in life, only opportunity" drives entrepreneurs and investors to pursue opportunity at the expense of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:02">[02:50:02]</a>. While founding a company is risky, it may not be much riskier than a job that can be lost through layoffs or sector downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:30">[02:50:30]</a>.

Charlie Munger stated that if he were to teach a business class, he would simply teach the history of 100 companies, discussing what went right and what went wrong, rather than providing a "degree that guarantees business success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:13">[02:51:13]</a>. He learned about business fundamentals like showing up on time, working with people, and servicing customers from working at a grocery store cash register <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:10">[03:09:10]</a>.

### The Power of Authenticity and Craft
The effectiveness of podcasts like *Acquired* and *Founders* stems from their authenticity and deep engagement with the subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:22">[02:13:22]</a>. People spending significant time with content creators develop a strong connection, leading to a "cheerful cult" around the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:48">[02:04:48]</a>. This contrasts with short-form content creators who may have millions of followers but struggle to gather a few thousand people in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:51">[02:15:51]</a>.

Warren Buffett's definition of a brand as "a promise" highlights the importance of consistently delivering quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:50">[02:06:50]</a>. For content creators, this means not breaking the promise of providing valuable, well-researched content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:04">[02:08:04]</a>.

The "value is in the compression and the distillation" of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. This means taking complex ideas and presenting them concisely and memorably, akin to how Charlie Munger and Steve Jobs simplify complex concepts into clear, actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:31">[02:40:31]</a>. Improving this skill requires constant practice and self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:42">[02:40:42]</a>.

### Rejecting Conventional Wisdom
Advice is often an average, and reality is a distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:31">[02:47:31]</a>. If one is an outlier, conventional advice may not apply, requiring selective adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:58">[02:47:58]</a>. For example, a founder of a company like BYD ignored advice from Charlie Munger and Li Lu, who advised against entering electric cars, and succeeded immensely, proving that sometimes, going against expert advice is the right path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:32">[02:48:32]</a>.

Podcast hosts of *Acquired* intentionally do the "opposite" of conventional podcasting advice, such as longer, less frequent episodes without guests, believing it's the right approach for their specific goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:23">[02:47:23]</a>. This aligns with Charlie Munger's view that most problems stem from a lack of intense interest in one's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:25">[02:46:25]</a>. Working on something one is "intentionally interested in" is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:34">[02:46:34]</a>.

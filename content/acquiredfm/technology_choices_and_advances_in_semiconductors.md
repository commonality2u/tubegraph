The semiconductor industry exhibits unique characteristics that influence [[Technological and Business Strategies of TSMC | business strategies]] and [[the_impact_of_technological_advancements_on_tsmcs_growth | technological advancements]]. Companies like TSMC may prioritize future revenues and customer loyalty over immediate profits, aiming for differential returns derived from an expanded customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This strategy is closely tied to the concept of [[scale_economies_in_semiconductor_industry | scale economies]] within the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Unusual Scale Economies and Industry Characteristics

The [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor industry]] presents an unusual type of [[scale_economies_in_semiconductor_industry | scale economy]] due to several distinct characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:

### High Capital Investment
Manufacturing facilities ("fabs") require substantially large and lumpy capital investments, with a new fab costing upwards of $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This significant upfront cost contributes to the [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing_and_technology_optimization | challenges in semiconductor manufacturing]].

### Predictable Material Performance Advances
Unlike most industries, the semiconductor sector benefits from "predictable material performance advances," often encapsulated by Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This predictability offers a high assurance that making the correct [[the_future_of_semiconductor_design_and_simulation | technology choices]] can lead to significant improvements, such as a tenfold enhancement in performance within 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This level of assured progress is highly unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Dependence on Upstream Suppliers
[[The impact of technological advancements on TSMCs growth | Technological advantages]] in the semiconductor industry are significantly driven by upstream suppliers like ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This reliance makes the selection of partners and technologies a critical, and often difficult, decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Critical Technology Choices
The history of the [[the_evolution_of_the_semiconductor_industry_and_the_rise_of_the_fabless_model | semiconductor industry]] includes difficult [[the_future_of_semiconductor_design_and_simulation | technology choices]]. For example, there was a prolonged debate and substantial investment concerning the adoption of x-ray lithography, highlighting the complex nature of these decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

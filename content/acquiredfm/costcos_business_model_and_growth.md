From: [[acquiredfm]] <br/> 

[[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] has developed a business model so effective that it inspires deep admiration among investors and business analysts alike, with one observer stating they've never been "more in love with a company in a business model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The deeper one explores [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]], the more positive attributes emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The company offers "Disneyland of consumer value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, providing a wide array of products—from cashews and eyeglasses to tires, refrigerators, and even diamond rings—often alongside a signature $1.50 hot dog and soda combo that has maintained its price for over 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:01:25]</a>.

While appearing simple on the surface due to its bulk sales, [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] success stems from "50 clever innovations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> refined over decades, operating like a well-rehearsed orchestra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Every aspect of [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]], from extra-wide parking spaces to its rotisserie chickens, is intentional, designed to offer "extremely great value" on high-quality products at the lowest possible prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Historical Foundations and Influences

[[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] was founded in Seattle in 1983 by retail veterans Jim Sinegal and Jeffrey Brotman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:27]</a>. However, its true history traces back to Saul Price and his companies, FedMart and Price Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:06:06]</a>. The modern [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] is a result of a merger between [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] and Price Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:21]</a>, with Price Club itself emerging from Price's earlier FedCo in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:33]</a>. These iterations represent "stacked learnings" from Saul Price's "brain children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:49]</a>.

Saul Price, born in 1916 to Jewish immigrants working in garment factories, developed a principled, customer-focused ideology influenced by the harsh labor conditions of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:53]</a>. He is considered one of the most influential American retail capitalists, alongside Sam Walton, who admitted to "steal[ing] more ideas from Saul than anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:51]</a>. Jim Sinegal, [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] co-founder and CEO, famously stated he "learned everything" from Saul Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Evolution of the Discounting Model
Saul Price's journey into retail began by advising clients in booming post-WWII San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:19]</a>. He observed FedCo, a non-profit, membership-based customer collective for federal employees in Los Angeles, which pooled buying power for better prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:16:25]</a>. This model, with a one-time $5 lifetime membership, wasn't about membership revenue but about affinity and value, similar to REI's membership today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:17:11]</a>.

When FedCo declined to partner, Price and his associates launched FedMart in San Diego in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:54]</a>. FedMart was a for-profit clone of FedCo, becoming the first "scaled quasi-national Discounter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:21]</a>. It was able to offer discounted prices because, as a membership club, it was not open to the general public, thus skirting laws that allowed manufacturers to set minimum retail prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:23:41]</a>. Saul Price is credited with inventing both the discounter and, later, the wholesale club models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:14]</a>.

FedMart's innovations, later adopted by [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]], included strategically pricing gasoline a few cents lower to drive store traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:27:02]</a>, adding pharmacies that significantly undercut competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:28]</a>, and developing a house brand called FM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:28:11]</a>. Jim Sinegal started as a part-time bagger at FedMart in 1955 and later ran its entire distribution and centralized warehousing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:26:02]</a>.

FedMart's "four priority order principles" laid the groundwork for [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] values: 1) best value to customers, 2) good wages and benefits for employees, 3) honest business practices, and 4) making money for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:29:02]</a>.

### Birth of the Wholesale Club Model
After being acrimoniously fired from FedMart, Saul Price, at 60 years old, launched Price Club in 1976 with his son Robert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:43:01]</a>. They decided not to compete directly with Discounters but to create a wholesale business for small businesses (like gas stations, restaurants, small variety stores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:45:23]</a>. The model focused on operating warehouses where manufacturers delivered products directly, eliminating the need for Price Club to manage complex logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:22]</a>.

This streamlined approach meant that goods could be sold before Price Club even had to pay suppliers, creating a "negative cash conversion cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:58:09]</a>. Price Club could charge a "real money" membership fee because it provided substantial value in managing inventory for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:48:02]</a>. They initially stocked only about 3,000 "highest volume items" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:50:00]</a>, a non-consensus move compared to competitors with 50,000+ SKUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:22]</a>.

An unexpected "Stroke of Luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:25]</a> occurred when the San Diego City Credit Union partnered with Price Club to offer group memberships to its consumer members, allowing them to shop at slightly higher prices than business members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:51:14]</a>. This "unlocked the gusher of consumers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>, proving that consumers were willing to buy in bulk directly from a warehouse for lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:55:02]</a>. This also spurred word-of-mouth marketing, as consumers would encourage business owners to join for better pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:52:09]</a>.

The popularity of Price Club also led to the iconic hot dog stand, which evolved into [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] $1.50 hot dog and soda deal—one of the few (if any) true loss leaders, remaining at that price for 47 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:39]</a>.

### The Merger: Price Club and Costco
In 1982, Jim Sinegal, having left FedMart, was recruited by Jeffrey Brotman to co-found [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] in Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:10:09]</a>. Their business plan was essentially to clone the Price Club model, but with Sinegal's "absolute focus on the details" and "built for scale" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:25]</a>. [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] achieved $1 billion in revenue in less than three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:23]</a> and $3 billion in under six, a record at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:31]</a>.

In June 1993, [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] and Price Club merged to form Price/[[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:50]</a>. This "merger of equals" was driven by Saul Price's desire to partner with Sinegal rather than [[Analysis of successful companies and business models like Costco | Walmart's]] Sam's Club, and by the need to compete with [[Analysis of successful companies and business models like Costco | Sam's Club's]] aggressive expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:17:02]</a>. The combined entity had 16 billion in revenue and 200 stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:26]</a>, still only slightly larger than [[Analysis of successful companies and business models like Costco | Sam's Club]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:58]</a>.

## Core Business Model Elements

### [[The role of memberships and consumer value at Costco | The Role of Memberships and Consumer Value at Costco]]
[[The role of memberships and consumer value at Costco | Costco's]] membership model is central to its profitability and strategy. While an obvious revenue stream, it has several "second order effects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:38]</a>:
*   **Customer Segmentation**: The upfront membership fee ($60 for basic, $120 for Executive) and the need to buy in bulk naturally select for more affluent customers with higher household incomes (average $125,000/year for [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] vs. $80,000 for [[Analysis of successful companies and business models and business models like Costco | Walmart]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:20:35]</a>. This means [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] has "the lowest prices but they have the wealthiest consumers of any major retailer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:48]</a>.
*   **Encourages Usage**: Paying an upfront fee encourages members to shop more to maximize the perceived value of their membership, leveraging the endowment effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:24]</a>.
*   **Reduced Shrinkage**: Members are less likely to steal to avoid losing their valuable membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:42]</a>.
*   **Profit Driver**: Membership fees represent approximately 70% of [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] operating income, despite being only $4.5 billion of its $230 billion top line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:16">[01:51:44]</a>. This allows the retail side to operate on razor-thin margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:47">[01:51:52]</a>.
*   **Executive Membership**: Launched in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:56]</a>, this $120 tier offers 2% cash back (capped at $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:16">[01:54:25]</a>. The break-even point is $3,000 in annual spending, close to the average household spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:42">[01:54:57]</a>. If a member doesn't earn back the fee, [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] refunds it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:36">[01:55:39]</a>. Executive members account for 45% of paid members but 73% of sales, demonstrating their higher spending and retention rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:23">[01:56:58]</a>.
*   **High Renewal Rates**: [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] boasts a 93% renewal rate for all U.S. members annually, significantly higher than typical streaming services that renew half their customers yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:18">[01:58:23]</a>.
*   **Payment Processing**: [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] can negotiate favorable terms with credit card companies like City and Visa, often receiving payment for the privilege of processing [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] enormous transaction volume from affluent customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:26">[01:59:09]</a>. Historically, Price Club initially did not accept credit cards to avoid fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:30">[01:59:58]</a>.

### [[Costcos supplier relationships and pricing strategy | Pricing Strategy and Supplier Relationships]]
[[Costcos supplier relationships and pricing strategy | Costco]] is famous for its strict cap on product markups:
*   **Fixed Markup**: [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] marks up nothing more than 14% above its acquisition cost from suppliers (15% for Kirkland Signature products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:57">[02:23:09]</a>. This compares to 100% at department stores and 25% at [[Analysis of successful companies and business models and business models like Costco | Walmart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:13">[02:23:28]</a>. This discipline fosters deep member trust in receiving the best price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:55">[02:24:05]</a>.
*   **No Loss Leaders**: Unlike other retailers, [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] generally avoids selling items below cost to attract customers, as this would require marking up other goods at "fat margins," which they view as treating customers "like they're stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:52">[02:30:43]</a>. (The hot dog combo is a rare exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:46]</a>).
*   **Tough but Fair Suppliers**: [[Costcos supplier relationships and pricing strategy | Costco's supplier relationships]] differ significantly from [[Analysis of successful companies and business models and business models like Costco | Walmart's]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:02">[02:25:07]</a>. Buyers are knowledgeable about commodity prices and work with suppliers to understand costs, ensuring that any price reductions benefit the customer (89% of the benefit goes to the customer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:31">[02:28:18]</a>.
*   **"Your margin is my opportunity"**: This philosophy, famously adopted by Jeff Bezos for [[Amazoncoms Early Business Strategy and Growth | Amazon]] after a meeting with Jim Sinegal in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:52">[02:29:56]</a>, means [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] focuses on reducing its own overhead and supplier prices to pass maximum savings to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:54">[02:31:40]</a>.

### Operational Efficiency and Lean Operations
[[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] operational model is designed for extreme efficiency:
*   **Low SKU Count**: With only 3,800 SKUs today (compared to 100,000+ at [[Analysis of successful companies and business models and business models like Costco | Walmart]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:18">[02:59:49]</a>, [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] significantly reduces complexity and allows for faster inventory turns (12.4 times per year vs. 8 for [[Analysis of successful companies and business models and business models like Costco | Walmart]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:43]</a>. This "intelligent loss of sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:46">[01:43:50]</a> from not offering every product size or brand simplifies logistics and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Docking**: 92% of [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] merchandise uses a cross-dock system, where supplier trucks unload pallets on one side of a distribution center, and [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] trucks pick them up on the other side for immediate delivery to warehouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:23">[01:47:14]</a>. This eliminates storage and handling, speeding up inventory flow and supporting the negative cash conversion cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:25]</a>.
*   **Minimalist Store Experience**: Products are sold directly from pallets, eliminating the need for extensive shelving, unpacking, or merchandising efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:13]</a>. Customers effectively do much of the "work" themselves.
*   **High Revenue per Employee/Square Foot**: These efficiencies result in over $730,000 in revenue per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:25]</a> and $1,800 in revenue per square foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:15]</a> (compared to $600 for [[Analysis of successful companies and business models and business models like Costco | Walmart]] and $450 for Target) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:09">[02:04:11]</a>. This is "unbelievably efficient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:45">[02:05:47]</a>.
*   **No Advertising**: [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] spends very little on advertising, relying instead on word-of-mouth and earned media (e.g., local news coverage of store openings, social media influencers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:07">[02:18:42]</a>.

### Culture and Management
[[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] culture is marked by consistency, discipline, and a long-term mindset:
*   **Code of Ethics**: The company operates under a strict code: 1) Obey the law, 2) Take care of our members, 3) Take care of our employees, 4) Respect our suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:26:13]</a>. Rewarding shareholders is the ultimate goal achieved by adhering to these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:16]</a>.
*   **Employee Well-being**: [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] pays its employees significantly higher wages ($26/hour average vs. $19.50 at [[Analysis of successful companies and business models and business models like Costco | Walmart]]) and provides excellent benefits including 401K matching and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:54]</a>. This results in extremely low employee turnover (7% attrition vs. 20% typical retail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:22">[01:32:38]</a> and low "shrinkage" (0.15% of sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:53">[01:33:07]</a>.
*   **Promoting from Within**: Senior management, including current CEO Craig Jelinek, often started in hourly roles at FedMart or Price Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:51]</a>. This deep institutional knowledge and loyalty are unique for a company of its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:34:08]</a>.
*   **Attention to Detail**: The culture emphasizes that "every cent matters" due to thin margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:39">[02:31:43]</a>.
*   **No Layoffs**: The company has never done a layoff, even after major mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:29">[02:35:43]</a>.

### Ancillary Services and "Treasure Hunt" Experience
[[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] offers a range of services beyond bulk retail goods:
*   **Gasoline and Pharmacy**: Inherited from FedMart, these services are intentionally priced low to drive traffic and offer additional value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **Optical, Tires, Food Court**: [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] vertically integrates in areas like optical (owning and operating three grinding labs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:57">[02:53:05]</a> and the hot dog/chicken operations to control costs and ensure value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:59">[02:54:02]</a>.
*   **Treasure Hunt**: Approximately 25% of [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] SKUs are unique, one-time "ooh and ah wow" items that drive repeat traffic and make shopping an "entertainment event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:47">[02:08:24]</a>.

### Kirkland Signature
Launched around the time of the merger in the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:45">[01:34:52]</a>, Kirkland Signature is [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] house brand, named after its former corporate headquarters in Kirkland, Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:34:03]</a>. It's intended to mean "a certain level of quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:54">[01:35:10]</a> at a lower price than national brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:31]</a>. Kirkland Signature is the world's largest consumer packaged brand by revenue, with $52 billion in annual sales (excluding gas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:04:05]</a>. This success is partly due to minimal on-shelf competition for its products within [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] warehouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:37:15]</a>.

## [[International expansion and future growth potential for Costco | Growth and Expansion]]

[[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] has consistently grown revenue by about 10% for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Consistent Store Growth**: [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] consistently opens new stores, which quickly mature and perform better than older stores in their initial years, demonstrating strong "stacked learnings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:45]</a>.
*   **Same-Store Sales**: [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] grew same-store sales by 14% last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:04">[02:06:11]</a>, illustrating continued growth even in mature markets.
*   [[International expansion and future growth potential for Costco | International Expansion]]: [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] has significant "running room" for global expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:32]</a>. They expanded to the UK, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan in the mid-to-late 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:22]</a>.
    *   **China**: Despite initial skepticism about a bulk warehouse model in dense urban Asian environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:27">[01:38:52]</a>, [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] value proposition has proven universally compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:11]</a>. The first store in China, opened in 2019, amassed 400,000 members in two years, compared to a U.S. average of 68,000 members per store at maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:57">[02:44:06]</a>. [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] strategically waited 20 years after receiving a permit to open its first store in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:39">[02:44:53]</a>.
*   **E-commerce**: [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] was initially slow to embrace e-commerce, but has adopted a "Costco flavored" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:49">[02:38:51]</a> approach. They focus on big and bulky items through [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] Logistics, delivering items like sheds and refrigerators, which are difficult for traditional e-commerce companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:41]</a>. They also offer "CostcoNext.com," which allows members to shop directly on partner websites for discounts, providing value without taking on complex e-commerce logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:45">[02:47:26]</a>.

## Defensibility and Challenges

### Defensibility ("Seven Powers")
[[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] business model exhibits several "powers" that provide persistent differential returns:
*   **Scale Economies Shared with Customers**: This is [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco's]] primary moat. Enormous purchasing volume allows them to secure the "absolute lowest price" from suppliers, and their lean operations ensure the maximum benefit is passed directly to the customer through fixed, low markups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:09">[02:11:28]</a>. This creates a virtuous cycle that is "impossible to catch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:38">[02:11:43]</a>.
*   **Counter-Positioning**: Uniquely, [[The history and founding of Costco | Costco]] holds a strong counter-positioning against [[Amazoncoms Early Business Strategy and Growth | Amazon]] and e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:14:08]</a>. Its core value proposition relies on customers physically coming to the warehouse, which allows for lower overhead and better prices than delivery-focused models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Process Power**: The deeply ingrained culture of efficiency, discipline, and customer focus, evident in everything from employee treatment to procurement, provides a significant operational advantage that is difficult to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:48">[02:17:10]</a>.
*   **Latent Branding Power**: While not actively used to increase margins, the "Kirkland Signature" brand and the overall "Costco" brand have developed a strong reputation for quality and value, fostering trust and loyalty among members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:30">[02:20:16]</a>.

### Bear Cases

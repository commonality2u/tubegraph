The dining room on the 19th floor of the Benchmark office serves a unique purpose, rooted in a tradition designed to foster curiosity and open dialogue among partners and esteemed guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This concept, part of [[benchmark_dinner_origins | Benchmark's dinner tradition]], was initiated with optimism to inject new practices and habits into the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Origins of the Dinner Tradition

The inspiration for these dinners came from Bill Gurley, who had read the [[ben_franklins_influence_on_modern_dinner_tradition | Ben Franklin]] biography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Franklin reportedly held four dinners a week, each dedicated to deep dives into specific topics like finance, chemistry, and life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This led to an experiment at Benchmark, starting with a large dinner around 2006 or 2007, which was described as "electric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Early attendees included Katarina Fake, Mike McHugh, Gideon Yu, and Martin Mikos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Philosophy of the Dinner

The core idea behind these dinners is that firms, like individuals, are a collection of habits, a concept drawn from William James <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For a venture firm, nurturing curiosity is seen as its "essential lifeblood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. While Monday meetings attempt to achieve this, their dynamic range is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The dinners offer an "open-ended, no agenda, wild exploration" of topics, fostering collective effervescence that cannot be achieved in one-on-one settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This honors the firm's purpose of constant learning and activating curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. These dinners contribute to the [[Role of Social Connection and Informal Meetings in Business | social connection and informal meetings in business]] at Benchmark.

## The Challenge of Traditional Table Design

A significant challenge identified was the inherent power structure in traditional dinner tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Rectangular tables** embed a power structure, often with a "head of the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Circular tables**, while lacking a head, tend to "atomize the group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

The goal was to avoid dominant participants and ensure an equitable conversation flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## The Non-Hierarchical Table Solution

Inspired by Jean-Marie Masoud's "the seven" table, a French designer known for organic, expandable, and collapsible designs, the firm sought a table that could deconstruct power centers and create a non-hierarchical, intimate construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The resulting table was designed by Ole Lundberg from a hand sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Its unique structure is designed to allow for "one conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Sidebar conversations are impossible because everyone at the table can hear everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This enforces the firm's ethos of collective focus and tuning in to whatever is being discussed, whether good, bad, or tough news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

This design stands in stark contrast to traditional venture capital partner meetings, where partners might be advised to have "side conversations" or "pre-sell a deal" before bringing it to the main table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. At Benchmark, one rule is "no pre-selling a deal," reinforcing the importance of the immediate, collective conversation fostered by the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Esteemed guests, often those not yet invested in, such as Dylan Field (Figma founder), Toby from Shopify, and Jeff Bezos, have sat at this table, experiencing its unique dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The table is not portable, remaining primarily in the office, though some dinners have taken place in other locations like Seattle or Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The table's structure clearly reflects the firm's ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

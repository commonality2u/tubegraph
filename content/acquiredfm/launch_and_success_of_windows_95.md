Windows 95 marked a pivotal moment both for Microsoft and the broader computing industry. Released on August 24, 1995, this operating system revolutionized personal computing, bringing numerous advancements that defined a new era of user-friendly, multimedia-rich personal desktop environments.

## A Masterclass in Marketing

The launch of Windows 95 was a spectacle of marketing ingenuity. Microsoft executed a massive global campaign that resembled the launch of a blockbuster movie rather than a software product. This included hiring comedian Jay Leno to co-host the launch event with Bill Gates, underscoring the blend of technology and entertainment that characterized the release. This strategic marketing play not only captured public attention but also set a new benchmark for product launches in the technology industry.

Microsoft licensed "Start Me Up" by The Rolling Stones as the campaign theme song, emphasizing the innovative 'Start' button feature that debuted with the operating system. This unprecedented move further cemented the launch's impact, turning it into a cultural phenomenon (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:25">[03:19:25]</a>).

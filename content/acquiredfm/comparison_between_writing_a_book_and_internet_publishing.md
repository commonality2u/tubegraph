The business model of publishing online, particularly through a [[subscription_business_model_in_internet_media | subscription service]], offers significant advantages over traditional book publishing, especially concerning revenue, content flexibility, and alignment with the [[The evolution and centralization of the internet | nature of the internet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Revenue and Business Model

From a financial perspective, operating a subscription-based internet publication is "far far far superior" to writing a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Subscription Model:** A single subscriber paying $120-$150 per year for a full bundle subscription results in substantially more revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Book Sales:** In contrast, selling a book for $20, with an author receiving about 7% royalties, yields significantly less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It's estimated that the revenue from internet publishing can be "five hundred times more" over a five-year customer lifetime compared to a single book sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The daily writing inherent in the online model generates "way more money" than writing a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Flexibility and Timeliness of Content

Internet publishing offers unparalleled flexibility compared to the static nature of a book.
*   **Adaptability:** A book is "frozen in time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This means that if an author's understanding or predictions change, or if a theory needs refinement, a book cannot be easily updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. For example, an initial assessment of Netflix's position within "aggregation theory" proved to be partially incorrect, but the online format allowed for immediate correction and further analysis regarding other platforms like Discovery, Time Warner, and Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Continuous Refinement:** The continuous nature of online writing allows for theories like "aggregation theory" to be articulated and revised over years, which is argued to be "a better product" than a single, static book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **[[Impact of current events on content creation | Current Events]]**: Writing about current events, even if the article itself becomes less "timeless" in the long run, is more effective for engaging an audience online. This helps people "grock it, get it, spread it, share it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Impact and Reach

While a book provides a "canonical work" that is set in stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, online publications can shape public understanding more dynamically.
*   **Shaping Understanding:** Concepts published online can influence common knowledge, accelerating the adoption of ideas by "a few months or at best a year or two before it becomes common knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Branding and Naming:** Coining a term and giving it a name, like "aggregation theory," makes ideas "stick" more effectively than descriptive titles, even if the underlying concepts were explored earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Timing:** As a writer, one must learn that there's a "right time and place for things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Being "too early" can lead to articles being less read or understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## The Nature of the Internet and Content Permanence

The internet is inherently transient, not permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Ephemeral Content:** One of Twitter's biggest mistakes was allowing tweets to be permanent; they "should have had disappearing tweets from day one" to be "just in the moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Permanence:** A permanent archive induces "fear," "ruin," and "reduces the facade" of being on a platform like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This fear is a "big reason why Twitter is not what it used to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Authorial Considerations

While a book provides a definitive "treatise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, there are personal and logistical factors that favor internet publishing.
*   **Productivity:** Daily deadlines in internet publishing "spur that productivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The absence of such deadlines for a book can be "terrifying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Fear of Being Wrong:** The fear of a book being "frozen in time" and potentially containing incorrect information is a significant deterrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Communication Challenges:** Explaining complex concepts like "aggregation theory" is more difficult without a single, canonical resource like a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Personal Interest:** The author expresses more interest and enjoyment in "building software" and "figuring out podcasts" than in writing a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Motivations:** The desire to write a book is sometimes viewed as being about the author's "ego" rather than "giving back to the Creator Community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Overview

Creative Artists Agency (CAA) is a leading talent and sports agency headquartered in Los Angeles, known for its influential role in the entertainment industry. The agency, founded in 1975, redefined talent representation by introducing innovative business strategies, rigorous teamwork, and a culture of package deals that significantly shifted the power dynamics of Hollywood and beyond. The story of CAA is closely tied to its founder, [[michael_ovitzs_influence_in_hollywood_and_caa | Michael Ovitz]], who led the agency to unprecedented success.

## Founding of CAA

The inception of CAA was the result of a dissatisfaction with William Morris Agency's (WMA) direction in talent representation. Michael Ovitz, along with four other young agents, decided to create their own agency following a disagreement over strategic priorities at WMA. CAA was born out of this spirit of [[challenges_and_advice_for_company_founders | innovation and ambition]], starting with limited funding but a bold vision for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

## Innovations and Business Model

Michael Ovitz re-engineered the traditional model of talent representation, focusing on [[importance_of_partnerships_in_business | teamwork rather than an individual agent-client relationship]]. This allowed clients to benefit from the collective expertise and networks of multiple agents. CAA also pioneered in creating package deals, assembling writers, directors, and actors into a ready-to-go package to studios, making it easier for studios to greenlight projects and providing CAA with significant negotiating power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.

Ovitz’s approach to representation was marked by relentless loyalty to clients, often maintaining personal relationships that transcended professional alliances. The agency's success was built on prioritizing client interests and creating opportunities in unique ways, such as orchestrating the deal that led to the production of "Jurassic Park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

The latter part of [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | John D. Rockefeller's]] life, particularly after 1890, saw a significant shift from his relentless focus on the [[History of Standard Oil | Standard Oil]] business to an equally intense dedication to philanthropy. This period defined much of his lasting legacy, shaping modern institutions and approaches to charitable giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.

## Transition from Business Leadership

By 1890, [[History and Heritage of Rolex | Standard Oil]] had achieved an almost monopolistic dominance, controlling 90% of the kerosene market in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Despite supporting the Sherman Antitrust Act as "dead on the vine legislation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> and later navigating an Ohio Supreme Court ruling forcing the trust's dissolution by reorganizing under a New Jersey loophole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>, Rockefeller began to drift away from day-to-day operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>. His physical appearance changed dramatically, losing all his body hair due to stress from managing his immense wealth and the constant appeals for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>.

[[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] himself stated that managing appeals for gifts became "too great for endurance," taking "more of my time and energy than [[History and Heritage of Rolex | Standard Oil]] itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a>. He found it incredibly challenging to find "high return on society ways" to give money away that aligned with his beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:28">[02:22:28]</a>. This struggle led him to seek a more structured approach to philanthropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>.

## The Birth of Modern Philanthropy

In 1891, [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] hired Frederick Gates, a Baptist minister he had worked with on the University of Chicago project, to manage his philanthropic endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. Together, [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] and Gates essentially "invented philanthropy" as a systematic and organizational process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:04">[03:22:04]</a>, establishing what would become the model for modern endowments and charitable foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:01">[05:27:01]</a>. This differed from previous forms of giving, such as tithing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:53">[03:20:53]</a>.

### Key Philanthropic Projects

*   **Spelman College**: One of the first significant projects by [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] and his family was financing the building of Spelman College, an HBCU women's college in Atlanta, in the early 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:04">[03:32:04]</a>. The college was named after his wife, Cettie Spelman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>. [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] was a lifelong abolitionist and supporter of Black rights, which was unusual for a wealthy white man of his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:06">[03:48:06]</a>.
*   **University of Chicago**: [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] became a major benefactor of the University of Chicago, a Baptist university project that began in the early 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>. This project was psychologically taxing for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:10">[03:39:10]</a>. He deliberately avoided putting his name on institutions to prevent public perception of repenting for business sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (Rockefeller University)**: In 1901, [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] and Gates established the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This institution focused on pure basic research, freeing scientists from "petty cares" and encouraging intellectual exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:08">[04:58:08]</a>. Later renamed Rockefeller University, it has been responsible for numerous medical breakthroughs, including:
    *   Culturing the infectious agent for syphilis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>
    *   Enabling tumor biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>
    *   Identifying the genetic defect for atherosclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>
    *   Developing travel vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>
    *   Identifying autoimmune disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>
    *   Developing virology as a field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>
    *   Developing the first peptide antibiotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>
    *   Showing genes are composed of DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>
    *   Discovering blood groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>
    *   Developing methadone for heroin addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>
    *   Devising the AIDS drug cocktail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>

    Winston Churchill lauded [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller's]] endowment of medical research as a "milestone in the progress of the race," akin to Renaissance patronage for art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. The institute has produced 38 Nobel laureates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:04">[05:33:04]</a>.

*   **Modern Medical Education**: [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] and Gates worked with Simon Flexner, the head of the Rockefeller Institute, to transform medical education in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. They adopted and spread the Johns Hopkins model of four-year, post-undergraduate medical school, funding the creation of medical schools at universities across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. They also later funded the creation of public health schools at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, which then became models for other universities globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

*   **The Rockefeller Foundation**: In 1913, the Rockefeller Foundation was chartered, institutionalizing [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller's]] philanthropic efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. It continues to give away hundreds of millions of dollars annually to causes in medicine, education, and the arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

*   **Junior's Contributions**: [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller's]] son, John D. [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] Jr., continued the family's philanthropic tradition, focusing particularly on natural preservation and urban development:
    *   Financed, designed, and directed a network of carriage roads in Acadia National Park, and later refinanced its restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
    *   A major donor to restore and recreate Colonial Williamsburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
    *   Contributed $5 million in 1926 to acquire land for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
    *   Led the acquisition of land for Grand Teton National Park, including the Jackson Hole area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
    *   Donated land for the United Nations building in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
    *   Abby Aldrich [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]], Junior's wife, was the brainchild behind the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, built on land that once held [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] mansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
    *   [[Founding and development of D E Shaw and its influence | Rockefeller Center]] was Junior's main business project, recruiting media organizations like RKO (Radio City Music Hall) and NBC as anchor tenants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Andrew Carnegie

Unlike Andrew Carnegie, who sought public recognition for his philanthropy (e.g., public libraries with his name on them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] preferred to give anonymously or through institutions not bearing his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. His approach to philanthropy mirrored his business philosophy: setting standards and creating templates for efficiency and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

## Personal Wealth and Enduring Family Influence

By 1913, two years after [[The breakup of Standard Oil | Standard Oil's breakup]], [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller's]] personal wealth reached $900 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This was approximately 3% of the U.S. GDP at the time, equivalent to about $470 billion in today's GDP-adjusted dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. He made more money after retiring and after the breakup than he did during his working career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

At his death in 1937, his fortune, largely held in family trusts, was estimated at $1.4 billion, or about 1.5% of U.S. GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. The [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] family, now seven generations in with about 170 heirs, had a fortune of approximately $11 billion in 2016, a testament to effective wealth management and continued philanthropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Firms like Rocko (a wealth management firm) and Venrock (a venture capital firm, an early investor in Apple) are part of the [[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller]] family's enduring business ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

In a symbolic move highlighting the evolution of their legacy, the Rockefeller Foundation pledged in December 2020 to dump its fossil fuel holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

[[John D Rockefeller and his business strategies | Rockefeller's]] contributions to medicine, education, and public works through his pioneering philanthropic model have profoundly touched and modernized nearly every aspect of American life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

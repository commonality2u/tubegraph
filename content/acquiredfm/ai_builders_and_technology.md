Hugging Face has become the leading platform for [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI Builders]], whom Clem Delong likens to "the new software engineers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. In the past, technology was built by writing millions of lines of code to create products like Facebook or Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Today, technology is created by training models using datasets and building [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI apps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Hugging Face's Role in the AI Ecosystem

Hugging Face serves as the central platform where most [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI builders]] find models, datasets, and build applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Scale and Impact
*   Over 5 million [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI builders]] use the platform daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Collectively, over 3 million models, datasets, and apps have been shared on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   Well-known models like Llama 3.1, Stable Diffusion (for images), Whisper (for audio), and Flux (for images) are among those shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   The platform is soon expected to cross 1 million public models shared, with almost as many being used internally and privately by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   An [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI model]], dataset, or app is built on Hugging Face every 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

The ecosystem around Hugging Face is compared to the Web 2.0 era (2008-2010) with its focus on RESTful APIs and "API mashups," enabling the creation of new things from open, flexible building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This new paradigm is replacing existing capabilities, with [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]] now being used to build search and social networks, while also unlocking entirely new use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Collaboration and Community
Hugging Face serves as a platform for collaboration in building [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Features like commenting, versioning code, models, and datasets, reporting bugs, and adding reviews are crucial for enabling larger teams to build AI together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Salesforce have thousands of users on the Hugging Face platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The company's development is highly community-driven, following feedback from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## Evolution of Hugging Face

Hugging Face's journey began in 2016, not as an [[Impact of AI on software development | AI infrastructure]] company, but as a chatbot aimed at teenagers, named after the hugging face emoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### The Pivot to AI Infrastructure
The company's initial idea was to build an [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI tamagotchi]], a fun conversational AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. At the time, conversational [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]] required stitching together many different models for tasks like text extraction, intent detection, answer generation, and emotion understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This led the founders to consider building an abstraction layer platform to manage multiple models and datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

The pivotal moment came in 2017 with the release of Google's Transformer paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Thomas, a co-founder and chief scientist, ported Google's BERT model from TensorFlow to PyTorch over a weekend, which garnered significant developer interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This led to Hugging Face becoming the steward of the Transformers library, an open-source project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Community feedback drove the expansion to hosting models, datasets, and applications, eventually transforming Hugging Face into a "new GitHub for [[Impact of AI on software development | AI]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Open vs. Closed Source AI

The debate between open and closed source [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]] is seen as misleading, as open source forms the foundation for all [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]], including that used by closed-source companies like OpenAI and Anthropic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

### Shifting Landscape
From 2017 to 2019, most [[Evolution of AI development | AI research]] and models were shared publicly by the research community, including Google and OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. This openness and collaboration significantly accelerated progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. However, in the last two to three years, the field has become less open due to commercial considerations and "misleading arguments" around safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

### The Misleading Safety Argument
The argument emphasizing the existential risk of [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]] is used to justify less openness, suggesting that sharing research is dangerous as "bad actors" could exploit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. This is compared to historical fears surrounding new technologies, such as books or nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. The term "artificial intelligence" itself is believed to contribute to these fears, making it sound more intimidating than "software 2.0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

The speaker believes that openness empowers thousands of new [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI companies]], fostering a "redistribution of the cards" and aligning company building with societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

## [[Investment and business models in AI | Investment]] and Business Models in AI

Clem Delong states that building an [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI startup]] is "very different than building a software startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

### Capital Intensity
Foundational model companies, such as Mistral and OpenAI, require significant capital for compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. Most current investment is directed towards foundational LLMs (text models), but future foundational models could emerge for video, biology, chemistry, audio, or image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.

### Hugging Face's Business Approach
Hugging Face has raised over $500 million but spent less than half of that, and is profitable, which is unusual for [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. Their model focuses on providing value through their platform and features rather than engaging in a "race to the bottom" on compute pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. They offer "locked-in compute" that is seamlessly integrated with platform features, making it significantly easier for companies to use, even if it costs more than direct cloud provider usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. This approach eliminates the need for a separate team of [[Impact of AI on software development | AI infrastructure]] deployment engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.

There is still uncertainty regarding profitable and sustainable [[Investment and business models in AI | business models for AI]], even for large players like OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>. However, as the leading platform for [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI builders]], Hugging Face believes a sustainable, massive business model is inherent to its position, given that [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]] is becoming the default way to build technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.

## The Future of AI Builders

### Science-Driven Paradigm
[[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]] is fundamentally more science-driven than traditional software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Successful [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI companies]] often have a co-founder with a science background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. The pace of development is different; training and optimizing models can take months, unlike the rapid shipping cycles of software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. Scientists in [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]] aim for foundational, 10x improvements, contrasting with the incremental 5% gains often sought in traditional software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. The "Lean Startup" playbook may not apply to [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI companies]] due to their heavy capital needs before returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

### Growth and Inclusivity
Currently, there are approximately 5 million [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI builders]] globally, compared to around 50 million software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. It is anticipated that in a few years, there could be 50-100 million [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI builders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>, and potentially even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

The beauty of [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]] is its lower barrier to entry compared to traditional software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>. To be a software builder, one must learn a programming language and write code, which is a high barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. For [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]], one can contribute expertise or data to improve a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. This broader participation means:
*   More people can contribute to and understand the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
*   The technology can be shaped to be more aligned with societal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>.
*   Better and more inclusive products can be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.
*   [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI]] presents an "opportunity of the century" to disrupt monopolies and create new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

This shift suggests that eventually, "all tech companies will be [[AI and Automation in Customer Service | AI companies]]" that build, optimize, and fine-tune their own models for specific use cases, constraints, and domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. This envisions a future with as many models as code repositories today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>. While large, generalist models like ChatGPT are needed for broad applications, specialized, smaller, and more efficient models will cater to specific domains like banking customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>.

Understanding the financial structure of [[the_business_and_rights_dynamics_in_the_music_industry | music industry]] deals requires knowledge of how [[music_licensing_overview | music licensing]] works and the underlying [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | copyright law]] [00:00:06]. The primary purpose of [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | copyright law]] across intellectual property (IP), including trademarks and patents, is to spur innovation and creativity [00:00:20].

When a piece of music is created, two distinct [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | copyrights]] come into existence [00:00:44]:

## Sound Recording Copyright (Master)

The first [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | copyright]] is the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | sound recording copyright]], also known as a [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | master recording]] or a [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | master]] [00:00:50]. This [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | copyright]] protects the literal recording of the music as performed and captured in a studio [00:01:00]. Historically, [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record labels]] typically own these [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | masters]] [00:00:55]. This ownership is exchanged for the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | label]] assuming the financial risk associated with distributing and promoting the artist's work [00:01:14].

Historically, this model resembled the early [[crossover_between_hollywood_and_corporate_investment_deals | Venture Capital industry]], where investors took a majority stake in a company for providing initial funding [00:01:24]. In the [[the_business_and_rights_dynamics_in_the_music_industry | music industry]], with a limited number of dominant [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | labels]] and high demand from aspiring artists, the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | labels]] held significant leverage [00:01:56].

## Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)

The second [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | copyright]] is the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | musical composition copyright]], also known as the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | publishing right]] [00:02:05]. This covers the written lyrics and melody of a song [00:02:10]. It represents the "idea" of the song, something that could be put down on sheet music, distinct from the recorded performance [00:02:20].

Traditionally, these [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | publishing rights]] are held by the songwriters themselves, often managed through [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | music Publishers]] [00:02:13]. While [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | Publishers]] historically took a significant portion (around 50%) of the royalties from [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | composition copyrights]], their share is much less today [00:02:50]. For major songwriters, it might even be a fixed fee paid to the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | publisher]] for administrative services, effectively meaning the songwriter retains most of the ownership [00:02:58].

In the era before recorded music, [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | Publishers]] were immensely powerful, as [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | publishing rights]] (sheet music) were the major revenue source [00:03:27]. This meant artists and [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record labels]] were dependent on [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | publishers]] who owned these rights [00:03:41].

### Co-Writer Splits

Songwriting credits and the economic splits among co-writers are privately negotiated [00:03:33]. These splits can vary widely, from 50/50 to 90/10, or even a flat fee or small royalty for a guest co-writer [00:04:55]. If a song has multiple writers, all may need to approve certain uses requiring the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | publishing license]] [00:04:47].

## Licensing and Veto Rights

Many uses of music require approval from the owner of the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | sound recording master]] right, the owner of the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | publishing right]], or both [00:03:57]. In cases where both approvals are needed, both parties effectively have a veto right over the final product's use [00:04:10]. The distribution of income generated from these uses can differ wildly depending on the specific application [00:04:20].

## Economic Splits and Recoupment

When an artist signs a distribution deal with a [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]], the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | label]] typically fronts the money for album production and then owns the [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | master]] recording [00:05:37]. The artist's royalty stream from such deals is significantly smaller compared to [[sound_recording_and_musical_composition_copyrights | publishing rights]] splits [00:05:30]. While individually negotiated, artists usually receive only 10-15% of the economics, or up to 20-22% for very prominent artists, with the vast majority going to the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | record label]] [00:05:43].

### Recoupment

A critical concept in these deals is "recoupment" [00:06:00]. [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | Record labels]] provide an upfront advance to artists [00:06:08]. The artist only begins to participate in their royalty stream *after* the revenues generated by their music have covered, or "recouped," this initial advance [00:06:03]. For example, if a [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | label]] gives an artist a $500,000 advance, the [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | label]] will keep the first $500,000 in generated revenue before the artist's 10-15% royalty share kicks in [00:06:13]. This system is akin to a [[crossover_between_hollywood_and_corporate_investment_deals | VC]] preference stack on a cap table [00:06:36].

This system, often perceived as "predatory," stems from an older era where producing and distributing music was extremely costly [00:06:46]. [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | Labels]] had to invest significant capital into album creation, radio promotion, and distribution without knowing if an artist would find an audience [00:06:50]. Given that a large percentage of artists fail, the economic split needed to ensure that the success of a few winners could compensate for the losses incurred on many unsuccessful ventures, similar to how a [[crossover_between_hollywood_and_corporate_investment_deals | VC]] fund operates [00:07:07]. This structure was deemed necessary in a time when substantial upfront investment was required to test an artist's market viability [00:07:41].

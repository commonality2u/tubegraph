The structure of economic splits and the concept of recoupment are central to understanding music deals, particularly regarding the ownership and licensing of musical works. The fundamental purpose of copyright law is to spur innovation and creativity across all intellectual property, including music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Two Copyrights in Music

When a piece of music is created, two distinct copyrights come into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:

1.  **Sound Recording Copyright (Master Recording/Master)**:
    *   This copyright pertains to the literal recording of the music as it was produced in the studio and heard by the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   Traditionally, these masters are owned by the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   Record labels historically assume ownership of these masters in exchange for taking on the financial risk of betting on, distributing, and promoting an artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This model has been compared to the old-school venture capital industry, where investors took a majority stake for putting up money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Despite changes in market terms and the appetite for capital, the music industry is dominated by essentially three major labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   Under these distribution deals, where a label fronts the money for an album, the label owns the master recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The artist's royalty stream is independently negotiated but typically ranges from 10-15%, potentially reaching 20-22% for very big artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The vast majority of the economics go to the record label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

2.  **Musical Composition Copyright (Publishing Right)**:
    *   This copyright covers the written lyrics and melody of a song, akin to what could be put down on sheet music â€“ representing the *idea* of the song before it's played or recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   These rights are traditionally held by the songwriters themselves, often through their [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | music publishers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   Historically, [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | publishers]] would take 50% of the royalties from the composition copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Today, this percentage is much lower, sometimes a fixed fee for back-office services, meaning songwriters largely own their own composition rights and can decide on their licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   Before recorded music, [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | publishers]] were immensely powerful, as publishing rights were the primary rights, and artists were at the mercy of publishers who owned the sheet music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   Songwriting credits and the resulting splits for co-writers are privately negotiated and can be split in any way (e.g., 50/50, 90/10, or a flat fee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For example, deals exist between artists like Taylor Swift and co-writers like Liz Rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Licensing and Veto Power

These two copyrights are the foundational building blocks for all other uses of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Some uses require approval from only one copyright holder, while others require both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Both the owner of the sound recording master right and the owner of the publishing right effectively have a veto on who can use the final product for use cases requiring both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The splits and generated income vary wildly depending on the specific use of the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## The Concept of Recoupment

A critical aspect of [[the_evolution_of_record_deals_in_the_music_industry | record deals]], particularly with record labels, is the concept of recoupment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### How Recoupment Works

*   Artists only begin to participate in revenues from their music *after* the record label has recouped the upfront advance they provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   For instance, if a label gives an artist a $500,000 advance, the label will keep the first $500,000 generated from sales or streams of the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   The artist's negotiated royalty share (e.g., 10-15%) only applies to revenues generated *after* the advance has been fully recouped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This is analogous to a VC preference stack on a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Rationale Behind Recoupment

This seemingly "predatory" deal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> stems from an era where it was very expensive to:
*   Make an album <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   Get it on radio and achieve distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   Acquire fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

More importantly, most artists (like startups) fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Record labels, like [[role_of_record_labels_and_music_publishers | book publishers]] or venture capitalists, sink significant money into these ventures to see if they will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. A 90%+ failure rate necessitates an economic split where the success of a few winners can more than compensate for the losses from the majority of failed bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

However, this dynamic is changing significantly in the "new world" where it's no longer necessary to invest large sums upfront to determine if an artist has an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This shift directly impacts [[changes_in_the_music_industry_business_model | the economics of music streaming]] and the overall [[the_evolution_of_record_deals_in_the_music_industry | evolution of record deals]].

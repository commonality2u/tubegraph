eBay, originally conceived as "electronic Bay Area," began as a collection of internet services developed by [[Pierre Omidyars journey from pen computing to founding eBay | Pierre Omidyar]] in his free time while working full-time at General Magic [02:02:04]. The website initially featured various content and programmatic elements, with one key link dedicated to "Auction Web" [02:28:30]. This "Auction Web" component famously evolved into what is now known as eBay [02:45:00].

## Initial Business Model and Product-Market Fit

Initially, [[Pierre Omidyars journey from pen computing to founding eBay | Pierre Omidyar]] hosted auctions for free on the platform [03:41:00]. However, as traffic surged, his server costs "went through the roof" [03:45:00]. This led him to reluctantly request a small listing fee from users to cover expenses [03:48:00]. Famously, users would send checks to his apartment, which he could not open fast enough due to the volume [03:57:00]. This overwhelming response signaled strong product-market fit [04:04:00].

To manage the influx of payments, [[Pierre Omidyars journey from pen computing to founding eBay | Pierre Omidyar]] brought on Jeff Skoll, a newly minted MBA from Stanford Business School, to serve as the "business guy" and primarily open and cash checks [04:11:00]. This transition from a free service to a paid model ensured eBay became a prominent internet company rather than remaining a non-profit resource like Wikipedia or Craigslist [04:29:00].

## Seeking Professional Investment

Despite having strong revenue and cash flow, [[Pierre Omidyars journey from pen computing to founding eBay | Pierre Omidyar]] recognized the value of venture capitalists (VCs) and a professional board for the company's growth, drawing on his experiences from Inc and General Magic [05:04:00]. He and Jeff Skoll pitched to various firms on Sand Hill Road, but "literally everybody else" turned them down [05:27:00].

Only [[Benchmarks investment strategy in eBay | Benchmark]] showed interest [05:37:00]. Bruce Dunleavy, an investor who knew [[Pierre Omidyars journey from pen computing to founding eBay | Pierre Omidyar]] from his Inc days, was involved [05:23:00]. [[Benchmarks investment strategy in eBay | Benchmark]]'s partners, including Bob and David, were keen on consumer-focused businesses and believed they could bring in a strong management team [05:44:00]. This approach contrasted sharply with that of [[Jeff Bezos and early internet business exploration | Jeff Bezos]] and Amazon, where Bezos arrived with a full business plan and received early cold calls from VCs like John Doerr [03:22:00].

## The Decision to Grow vs. Sell

[[Benchmarks investment strategy in eBay | Benchmark]] offered [[Pierre Omidyars journey from pen computing to founding eBay | Pierre Omidyar]] and Jeff Skoll a term sheet for a $6.7 million Series A financing at a $20 million pre-money valuation [06:06:00]. At this point, eBay was growing 10% month-over-month and was profitable, consistently generating cash [07:11:00].

Concurrently, eBay received a competing offer: an acquisition bid from Knight Ridder, a large newspaper conglomerate [06:20:00]. Knight Ridder's interest made sense given eBay's classifieds-like nature, a traditional newspaper business [06:53:00]. The offer was compelling: $50 million for [[Pierre Omidyars journey from pen computing to founding eBay | Pierre Omidyar]] and Jeff Skoll [07:33:00]. This presented [[the_decision_between_selling_ebay_or_growing_it_independently | the decision between selling eBay or growing it independently]] or building it out further [07:26:00].

To incentivize [[Pierre Omidyars journey from pen computing to founding eBay | Pierre Omidyar]] and Jeff Skoll to not take the acquisition offer, [[Benchmarks investment strategy in eBay | Benchmark]] reportedly structured equity-backed loans totaling $1.5 million ($750,000 each) [09:07:00]. This effectively served as an early secondary transaction, allowing the founders to take some money off the table and making them comfortable rejecting the $50 million acquisition [10:41:00]. This move was highly untraditional and non-consensus at the time, as no other VCs were willing to structure such a deal [10:32:00].

## Post-Investment Growth and IPO Success

The deal with [[Benchmarks investment strategy in eBay | Benchmark]] was finalized in the summer of 1997 [11:29:00]. Just over a year later, in September 1998, eBay went public [11:37:00]. During this period, [[Benchmarks investment strategy in eBay | Benchmark]] and David Byrne were heavily involved in recruiting [[Meg Whitmans leadership and eBays IPO success | Meg Whitman]] from Hasbro (and formerly Disney and Bain) to become CEO [11:43:00].

At the IPO, [[Benchmarks investment strategy in eBay | Benchmark]]'s $6.7 million investment was valued at $400 million [12:11:00]. Due to lock-up periods, they couldn't distribute their shares immediately. By the time the lock-up expired in the spring of 1999, that stake had soared to over $4 billion [12:25:00]. This represented an astonishing return on an $85 million fund, turning a $6.7 million investment into $4 billion in under two years [12:34:00]. This alone resulted in a 47x return on their fund [12:46:00].

Even if a reported additional $1 billion kicker from the equity-backed loans is factored in (if incremental to the equity investment), it would represent an additional 12x return [13:10:00]. [[Benchmarks investment strategy in eBay | Benchmark]] famously distributed at least $4 billion to their limited partners [13:37:00]. This monumental success allowed them to distribute approximately $1.5 billion in carry dollars among their equal partnership and even to their assistants [14:47:00]. This demonstrated that a company could achieve massive success even if it faced [[challenges_of_starting_a_paid_online_business | challenges of starting a paid online business]] or initially struggled to secure VC funding [03:41:00].

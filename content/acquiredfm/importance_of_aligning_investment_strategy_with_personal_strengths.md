A core principle in investing and career development is that one's strategy should align with their personal demeanor and strengths [00:00:03]. This approach fosters enjoyment, competitive advantage, and durability in the long run [00:00:21]. It emphasizes finding something that plays to one's strengths, avoids weaknesses, and is personally enjoyable [00:00:37]. Pursuing a path solely for financial gain without enjoyment is considered a "world-class mistake" [00:01:05].

## The Conundrum of Investing: Balancing Strengths and Open-Mindedness

While it's crucial to "stick to your last" and do what you're good at, investing presents a fundamental dichotomy: it's also [[balancing_confidence_and_openmindedness_in_investment_decisions | essential to be open-minded and willing to change]] [00:02:51].

This paradox manifests in several ways:
*   **Confidence vs. Open-mindedness:** Investors must be confident enough to back risky ventures and stay with them through downturns, even buying more when prices decline. However, this confidence should not lead to stubbornness or "pig-headedness," where one continues to throw "bad money after good" [00:03:00].
*   **Concentration vs. Diversification:** To make a significant impact, one must concentrate holdings on a few good ideas. Yet, diversification is necessary to protect against unforeseen events [00:03:21].

### The Berkshire Hathaway Example
A common critique of Warren Buffett is his historical tendency to "totally ignore" technology [00:01:40]. While he is incredibly smart and understands business, his view of technology seemed limited to "science projects" where technical advantage was paramount [00:01:58]. Many technology companies, however, thrive on moats similar to non-technology businesses, suggesting Buffett could have succeeded in the space if it were within his comfort zone [00:02:11]. This illustrates the challenge of staying within one's comfort zone while also needing to evolve [00:01:26].

## The Indispensable Role of Judgment

The complexities and dichotomies of investing highlight that it cannot be reduced to a simple algorithm; human judgment is paramount [00:03:41]. Qualitative judgments about the future are where human competitive advantage lies, as computers are not yet capable of making such discerning assessments [00:03:53].

### Second-Level Thinking
Superior investing requires "second-level thinking" – thinking at a higher, more correct, and different level than the consensus [00:06:01]. This involves unique perception, knowledge advantage, insight, context, and judgment, which are largely intangible qualities [00:06:22]. It's about diverging from the consensus *correctly*, not just for the sake of being different [00:06:12].

### Qualities of Good Judgment
Good judgment stems from a combination of factors:
*   **Deep Knowledge and Understanding:** A real framework for what matters and why [00:06:51].
*   **Rationality:** The ability to think logically and avoid emotional decision-making [00:06:59].
*   **Self-Awareness:** Understanding one's own biases and how they might affect decisions [00:07:07].
*   **Intellectual Humility:** Acknowledging the possibility of being wrong, and knowing what one doesn't know [00:07:16]. This includes understanding where one can't opine and where further learning or external input is needed [00:07:27].

## Evaluating Judgment in Others

Whether in recruitment or [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | venture capital]], evaluating the judgment of others is crucial.

### Recruiting at Oaktree
At Oaktree, the recruitment process focuses on identifying "smart eyes" – individuals who grasp concepts exceptionally well, understand what is important, and can look beyond readily available quantitative information [00:08:04]. They seek people who intuitively understand complex dynamics, like "the cure for low oil prices is low oil prices" [00:08:26]. Beyond intelligence, Oaktree values team players who can work collaboratively, exchange ideas, and thrive on input from peers, superiors, and subordinates [00:08:35]. The firm avoids "lone wolves" or those driven by short-term individual quantitative performance [00:08:51].

### Venture Investing: Backing Founders
In [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | venture investing]], a significant portion of decision-making revolves around understanding and backing the right founders [00:09:16]. Evaluating a founder's judgment involves:
*   **Understanding Their Story:** Diving into their background and why they made past decisions, as it's difficult to fake what one has genuinely done [00:10:00].
*   **Learning and Evolution:** Assessing if they have learned and evolved from their experiences [00:10:39].
*   **First Principles Thinking:** Determining if they make decisions based on fundamental truths and are willing to go against the herd [00:10:43].
*   **Passion and Specific Knowledge:** Identifying if their ideas stem from a passion and a deep understanding of a real problem [00:10:48].

Successful founders are often "weirdos" – individuals who are four standard deviations from the mean in a particular area [00:11:39]. They are not content with conventional approaches and possess the conviction to think for themselves, driven by what they believe is right [00:12:22].

## The Path to Exceptionality

Exceptional results cannot come from doing what everyone else does [00:12:54]. The advantage in fields like [[investing_and_venture_capital_strategies | investing]] and [[complexity_investing_and_investment_philosophy | venture capital]] lies in the absence of a clear roadmap or simple algorithms for consistently correct outcomes [00:13:07]. Success belongs to the person who sees things differently and better [00:13:21]. As David Swenson of Yale's endowment noted, one must be "uncomfortably idiosyncratic" to win, even if it means being out of step with conventional wisdom [00:13:28].

Ultimately, even with a brilliant idea like Google's PageRank algorithm, a mediocre person would likely fail to build a successful company [00:13:53]. This is because building a company is incredibly hard, and competition demands exceptional individuals who can exhibit outstanding judgment, attract and retain other talented people, and navigate complex challenges [00:14:18].

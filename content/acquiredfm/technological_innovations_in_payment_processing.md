The modern credit and debit card system, largely pioneered by Visa and Mastercard, allows for global transactions with a piece of plastic or a digital device, where neither merchant nor consumer needs to know or trust each other directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. While merchants may have mixed feelings about interchange fees, the system's ability to create and capture value is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Early Payment Methods and Their Challenges

Historically, transferring money in the U.S. was limited to cash or checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Checks, while functional, presented several issues:
*   **Discounts for Processing** Prior to the Federal Reserve's creation in the 1910s, parties cashing checks did not receive the full face value due to costs associated with mailing and traveling to clear them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This concept of a discount fee, similar to later interchange rates on credit cards, was present from the start due to the expense and risk of processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Time Delays** Clearing checks took a long time, often relying on physical transport like the Pony Express in the 1800s and early 1900s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Manual, check-by-check reconciliation was common until Automated Clearing Houses (ACH) were developed in the U.S. in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

To overcome these inefficiencies, merchants and their regular customers adopted credit accounts, essentially ledgers where tabs were kept and settled monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This evolved into brand-specific charge cards, such as those mailed out by Standard Oil of Indiana to 250,000 customers in 1939 for exclusive use at their facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Local retailers later collaborated on standardized charge account systems to simplify back-office operations and enable a shared credit history, addressing the problem of customers running up debt across multiple establishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

## The Birth of Independent Payment Networks

The concept of an independent, third-party for-profit network emerged with Diner's Club and American Express (Amex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Diner's Club, founded in 1949, focused on a business-person-focused charge card network for restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. These early networks charged merchants a significant discount rate, around 5-7% of the gross bill, due to high operational costs and lack of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. They also added fees for cardholders, typically paid by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

American Express, initially an express mail company founded in 1850 by Henry Wells and William Fargo, expanded into traveler's checks and later launched its charge card program in 1958, quickly gaining 700,000 members due to existing relationships with companies, restaurants, and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. This marked the entry of a "bank-like entity" into the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

## Bank of America's Innovation: The BankAmericard

In September 1958, Bank of America, then the largest bank in America, launched the BankAmericard by mailing 65,000 unsolicited plastic cards to customers in Fresno, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This act, known as "the drop," initiated mass chaos and significant fraud, with 22% of initial credit issued in Fresno ending up in default or delinquency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

Despite these early losses, Bank of America, being a large consumer bank unlike its corporate-focused New York counterparts, could absorb them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. Their motivation was two-fold:
1.  **Streamline Lending Programs**: The BankAmericard aimed to consolidate Bank of America's disparate consumer lending, which included mortgages, car loans, and even washing machine loans, all of which previously required a physical bank visit and loan authorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
2.  **Increase Loan Volume**: Crucially, the BankAmericard allowed customers to roll over balances into loans, birthing the modern credit card model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. This also meant that money often stayed within Bank of America's system if both consumer and merchant banked with them, freeing up capital and increasing float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

> [!info] Convenience and Credit
> The BankAmericard bundled convenience with credit, allowing consumers to delay payment or finance purchases without needing individual loan authorizations for each item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. This marked a significant [[disruptive_innovation_in_the_payments_industry | disruptive innovation in the payments industry]] by turbocharging consumer lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

By 1961, the program became profitable, a fact Bank of America kept secret to deter competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. From 1960 to 1966, only ten new credit cards were introduced in the U.S. due to this perceived failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.

## The Rise of the Open-Loop Network: From BankAmericard to Visa

In 1966, Bank of America unveiled its grand plan: to license the BankAmericard program and network to other banks across the country and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. This marked the seed of Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. Licensees paid a franchise fee and a percentage of gross transaction revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. By 1968, hundreds of banks had signed up, boasting 6 million cardholders across the U.S. and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.

This expansion exposed problems with the original "closed-loop" model, where Bank of America managed both consumer and merchant banking relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. With multiple banks involved, an "open-loop" system was needed to settle transactions between different issuing banks (consumer's bank) and acquiring banks (merchant's bank), leading to the concept of interchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.

> [!info] D. H. (Dee) Hock: Visionary Founder
> Dee Hock, the BankAmericard franchisee program manager from Seattle National Bank of Commerce, became the driving force behind Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. An outsider with an associates degree and a history of being fired for insubordination, Hock was nevertheless brilliant and persuasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. He convinced Bank of America to relinquish control and the other banks to collaborate, foreseeing the immense value of a global payment and credit network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

In October 1968, frustrated licensee banks demanded a summit in Columbus, Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. Hock proposed forming a new organization, National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI), which would later become Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. He designed a "for-profit non-stock Membership Corporation" where ownership was tied to participation volume, and governance was democratic with an 80% vote threshold for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. The mission was to foster cooperation and trust among competing institutions to grow the network beyond any single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>.

Crucially, Hock secured an antitrust "hall pass" from the U.S. Department of Justice, arguing that the system's profound utility for American consumers and businesses justified allowing competitors to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:38">[01:24:38]</a>. Every one of the over 200 member banks signed up for the new organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a>.

In 1972, Hock established a parallel international organization using the BankAmericard system, making Visa global from nearly day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:59">[01:25:59]</a>. The name "Visa" was chosen for its universality in nearly every language, implying a "passport" to commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>. Visa standardized the blue, white, and gold card design, but allowed banks to co-brand the top blue stripe with their own logos or affinity programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>.

The name change to Visa in 1977 triggered a massive growth spurt: the number of participating banks grew 20% and active cardholders grew 45% in one year, propelling Visa past Master Charge (now Mastercard) in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>.

## Key Technological Developments at Visa

The creation of a truly global, instant payment network required significant [[technology_infrastructure_evolution | technology infrastructure evolution]] beyond its organizational innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>.

1.  **Transaction Authorizations (Base I)**:
    *   Initially, merchants used "floor limits" where transactions below a certain amount (e.g., $50) were approved at the cashier's discretion, accepting a certain level of fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. For transactions above the limit, cashiers had to phone the merchant's bank, which would then call the cardholder's bank to verify credit, a process that could take 20 minutes and didn't work outside business hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>.
    *   In 1971, Hock initiated Project Base (BankAmericard Authorization System Experimental) to build a computerized authorization system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>. Despite initial plans for a joint venture with American Express being thwarted by antitrust concerns, Visa built its own system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>.
    *   Hock hired Aram Tulan to lead this effort, giving him nine months to build a nationwide and then worldwide telecom network, install computer systems in member banks, and train staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:51">[01:56:51]</a>. Crucially, they built a new centralized data center in San Mateo, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>.

2.  **Settlement Digitization (Base II)**:
    *   The second major problem was efficiently settling transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:42">[01:59:42]</a>. This involved reconciling transactions, moving money, and sending statements, which was a manual, paper-intensive, and exponentially complex process as the network grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:15">[02:00:15]</a>.
    *   Visa developed "Base II," its own automated clearing house system for electronic settlement, concurrent with the Federal Reserve building its own ACH for checks in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>.
    *   Once Base II was live (in less than a year), average settlement time dropped from a week to overnight, saving banks approximately $15 million in labor and postage costs in the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:07">[02:03:07]</a>.

3.  **Redundant Data Centers**:
    *   Recognizing the vulnerability of relying on a single data center, Visa's tech team pioneered the concept of running operations concurrently across multiple data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:40">[02:05:40]</a>. This was a groundbreaking [[technology_infrastructure_evolution | technological advancement in aerospace]] in the nascent data center world, ensuring 99.999% uptime, comparable to or exceeding cloud providers like AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:41">[02:06:41]</a>.

4.  **Magnetic Stripe and Point-of-Sale Terminals**:
    *   To fully digitize transactions, cards needed to be machine-readable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:41">[02:08:41]</a>. Visa standardized on magnetic stripe technology for cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:17">[02:09:17]</a>.
    *   They then created a specification for digital point-of-sale (POS) terminals, leading to the rise of companies like Verifone, which developed inexpensive, compact devices for merchant countertops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:57">[02:09:57]</a>. Merchants were incentivized with discounts on transaction fees for using these digital terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>.
    *   To connect these terminals, Visa rented unused network capacity from CompuServe, an early consumer networking service, for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:10">[02:12:10]</a>.
    *   This digitization significantly cut down fraud, with chargebacks reduced by 82% in pilot programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:13:51]</a>. It also enabled Visa to operate at virtually zero marginal cost, becoming a high-functioning "toll booth" for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:43">[02:15:43]</a>.

## Modern Payment Landscape and New Technologies

Today, Visa processes $14 trillion in volume and over 190 billion transactions annually, representing 27 transactions per person on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:02">[02:46:02]</a>. Its net income margins are an astounding 50%, with gross margins at 98% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>.

Key modern [[financial_innovations_and_fraud | financial innovations and fraud]] and related technologies:
*   **Interchange Fees**: While historical discount rates were 5-7%, today's average interchange for large U.S. merchants using credit cards is around 2% of the sale price, with the largest share (1.6%) going to the issuing bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:13">[03:09:13]</a>. Visa's network fee is much smaller (0.15-0.2%), but it has very low variable costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:37">[03:32:37]</a>. Debit transactions generally have lower fees due to regulatory reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:59">[03:33:59]</a>. This flexible interchange system incentivizes various parties in the payment ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>.
*   **Value-Added Services**: Visa now offers [[financial_innovations_and_fraud | financial innovations and fraud]] and analytics services, which contributed $6 billion to its revenue recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:42">[03:17:42]</a>. These are high-margin products that help them maintain growth despite downward pressure on core interchange fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>.
*   **Tokenization**: Services like Apple Pay use tokenization, where a unique token, not the actual card number, is sent during a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>. This enhances security and privacy while allowing Visa to offer more proprietary services related to these tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:58">[03:31:58]</a>.
*   **Real-Time Payment Networks**: Countries like Brazil (Pix), India (UPI), and the UK (Faster Payments) have implemented real-time payment networks that allow instant bank transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:45">[03:24:45]</a>. The U.S. also has FedNow, though its adoption is slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:36">[03:24:36]</a>. These systems, particularly when linked across geographies (e.g., Singapore and India), pose a potential [[challenges_and_competition_in_the_payment_industry | challenge and competition in the payment industry]] to traditional card networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Mobile Wallets**: Apple Pay and Google Pay have become popular quasi-alternative payment systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:04">[03:28:04]</a>. While they currently run on existing card rails, the ability to potentially disintermediate the card networks by processing payments directly, perhaps through owning POS terminals or partnering with banks for closed-loop systems, represents a significant bear case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:02">[03:26:02]</a>.

> [!quote] D. H. Hock on Vision
> "Any organization that could guarantee transport and settle transactions in the form of arranged electronic particles... 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, around the globe would have a market every exchange of value in the world that beggared the imagination." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>

## Value Creation and Capture

Visa and Mastercard together benefit from [[global_payment_systems_and_market_expansion | global payment systems and market expansion]], network economies, and scale economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:42">[03:05:42]</a>. Their combined network is a five-sided system (consumer, merchant, Visa, issuing bank, acquiring bank), making it incredibly robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:45">[03:55:45]</a>.

While there's debate on the fairness of interchange fees, which have reached $93 billion in the U.S. in 2022 (up from $33 billion in 2012) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:27">[02:55:27]</a>, the system has enabled trillions of dollars in transactions that might not otherwise exist, most notably [[technology_and_innovation_at_amazon | e-commerce]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. Merchants benefit from increased sales, broader buyer reach, guaranteed payment, and reduced cash handling costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:25">[02:44:25]</a>.

However, the system is difficult to change. Consumers who use rewards cards benefit significantly, effectively being subsidized by cash-paying households who pay higher prices due to embedded fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:30">[02:41:30]</a>. Efforts by large retailers like Walmart and Target to encourage direct payments have largely failed because the rewards offered by cards are too compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:35">[02:40:35]</a>. This "chicken or egg" problem for new entrants, combined with regulatory hurdles, makes it challenging to disrupt the established duopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">[02:43:02]</a>.

> [!info] The "Toll Booth" Business Model
> Visa operates as a "toll booth" business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:27">[03:07:27]</a>, capturing significant value as transactions flow through its network with essentially zero marginal cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:43">[02:15:43]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Despite its current dominance, Visa faces potential [[challenges_and_competition_in_the_payment_industry | challenges and competition in the payment industry]]:
*   **Maturity of Digital Payments**: With over 50% of consumer payments already digitized, the growth tailwind from the shift from cash to cards will decelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:53">[03:20:53]</a>.
*   **Closed-Loop Ecosystems**: The success of systems like China's Alipay and WeChat Pay, which operate as closed-loop super-apps, could pose a threat if similar models gain traction in other markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:56">[03:21:56]</a>. Government influence, as seen in China's UnionPay, could also lead to national payment rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:12">[03:23:12]</a>.
*   **Expansion into New Markets**: Visa aims to expand into B2B payments ($120 trillion volume) and business-to-consumer payments (e.g., insurance payouts, refunds) through products like Visa Direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:10">[03:34:10]</a>. Cross-border payments, with their high margins, also remain a key growth area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>.

The history of Visa is a testament to [[disruptive_innovation_in_the_payments_industry | disruptive innovation in the payments industry]] through both organizational and technological ingenuity. Its highly profitable business model remains aspirational for many technology companies today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:02">[03:15:02]</a>.

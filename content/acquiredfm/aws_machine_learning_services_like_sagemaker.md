AWS views machine learning (ML) as a significant component of its business, alongside its core compute offerings and increasingly important database services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Key Offerings and Strategic Focus
AWS has demonstrably increased its focus on machine learning, evident through several initiatives:
*   The announcement of SageMaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   The introduction of a dedicated custom ML keynote at their events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   A wide array of cloud-hosted ML offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   Support for TensorFlow, a framework originally developed by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Provision of their own container service (ECS) and an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While they offer Kubernetes to meet customer demand, AWS aims to encourage the use of their proprietary Amazon Container Service (ECS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Machine Learning Strategy and Data Proximity
AWS's strategy for [[amazons_investment_in_machine_learning | machine learning]] centers on data proximity and customer retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The most critical factor for running machine learning workloads is their proximity to the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Customer Retention through Data Lock-in
Once a customer selects AWS as their primary storage vendor and migrates their data into AWS data centers, they are unlikely to seek out other providers for their ML workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This means customers will typically run their ML on AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

> The [[aws_strategies_for_customer_retention_in_machine_learning | AWS strategy for customer retention in machine learning]] suggests that while their ML capabilities need to be competent, they don't necessarily need to surpass those of competitors like Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This is because if customers store their data with AWS, the convenience of running ML where the data resides often outweighs marginal differences in ML offering quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

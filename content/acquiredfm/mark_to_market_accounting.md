Mark to market (M2M) accounting is an accounting method that values assets and liabilities based on their current market price, rather than their historical cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. This method is common for financial institutions and venture capitalists, where the market value of assets (like stocks or portfolio companies) can be readily determined by third-party transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>. However, Enron controversially became the first non-financial company to adopt this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.

## Skilling's Insistence and SEC Approval
Jeffrey Skilling, a key architect of Enron's financial strategies, made the adoption of mark to market accounting a "lay my body across the tracks" condition for joining Enron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>. He believed he could not build the business he envisioned without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.

Initially, Enron's auditors, Arthur Andersen, were hesitant about applying M2M to an operating oil and gas company and required the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sign off on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The SEC initially rejected the idea, but Skilling, known for his "ludicrously compelling" intellectual arguments, personally convinced them to approve Enron's use of M2M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>. This decision by the SEC is noted as particularly puzzling, as they did not appear to have a conflict of interest in approving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.

## Exploitation and Inflated Revenues
With M2M accounting in place, Enron began to drastically inflate its reported revenues. They engaged in a "double-dipping" scheme:
1.  **Future Cash Flows as Immediate Revenue**: When making deals with oil and gas producers, Enron would project 20 years of future cash flows from these assets and recognize that entire projected value as revenue *today* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. This was done by taking the most aggressive possible stance on future prices and volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>.
2.  **Phony Sales to Special Purpose Entities (SPEs)**: Enron would then "sell" these assets (often poor deals) to special purpose entities (SPEs) that were largely controlled by Enron itself (requiring only 3% outside capital for off-balance sheet treatment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>. These "sales," which involved no actual cash changing hands, were booked as additional revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.

This created a self-reinforcing "pump and dump" dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. By recognizing all future revenue in the present, Enron had no recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. This meant they were constantly forced to make bigger and bigger deals to show continued growth and satisfy investor expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. This practice led to a "house of cards" that was destined to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>.

## Impact and Consequences
The aggressive application of M2M, coupled with the use of SPEs and the reliance on ever-increasing stock prices, allowed Enron to appear as the world's leading company on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>. However, this was achieved by "double-dcfing the value" â€“ essentially discounting future cash flows and then applying a multiple to that inflated number, leading to an N-squared valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:43">[03:09:43]</a>.

This inherent flaw, coupled with a lack of actual cash flow and true return on invested capital, made Enron's financial statements highly suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:17">[01:54:17]</a>. The company's collapse in late 2001, just months after Skilling resigned, exposed the massive fraud perpetrated through these legal (at the time) accounting maneuvers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:52">[01:59:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:12">[02:19:12]</a>.

## Sarbanes-Oxley Act
The Enron scandal, along with others like WorldCom, directly led to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:02">[02:38:02]</a>. SOX introduced significant reforms to corporate governance and accounting practices to prevent future frauds. Key provisions included:
*   Requiring CEOs and CFOs to personally certify the accuracy of financial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:01">[02:39:01]</a>.
*   Increasing penalties for fraud and tampering with evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:05">[02:39:05]</a>.
*   Requiring auditors to be more independent and prohibiting accounting firms from offering both auditing and consulting services under the same roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>.
*   Mandating public companies to disclose all their off-balance sheet entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:26">[02:39:26]</a>.

While SOX has been criticized for increasing the cost and complexity of being a [[public_markets_innovations_including_direct_listings_and_spacs | public company]], it is widely considered to have largely accomplished its goal of protecting the public from fraud in public markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:45">[02:41:45]</a>.

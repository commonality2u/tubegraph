The early financing and board involvement in Google is a story intricately linked with Ram Shriram, a business executive from Netscape and a co-founder of Junglee, a comparison shopping site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Junglee Acquisition and Ram Shriram's Pivot

Junglee was started by three Stanford Computer Science PhDs and Ram Shriram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Amazon acquired Junglee for approximately $150-175 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The Junglee team, based in Palo Alto, was required by Amazon to move to Seattle to avoid a tax nexus in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, the acquisition was ill-conceived, and within a few months, the team quit Amazon and moved back to Palo Alto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Notably, these same founders would later start a company acquired by Walmart, which became Walmart Labs, a significant factor in Walmart's e-commerce competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Ram Shriram's Google Investment

Back in Palo Alto, Ram Shriram connected with two other Stanford Computer Science PhDs: Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Ram Shriram, having just made money from the Junglee acquisition, became Google's first investor, putting in $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. He also joined the board of Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Jeff Bezos's]] Investment

Approximately six months after Ram Shriram's investment, [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Jeff Bezos]], who remained friendly with Ram despite the Junglee team's departure from Amazon, learned about Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Bezos]] and Mackenzie Scott flew to Silicon Valley to meet Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Ram's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

After the meeting, [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Bezos]] expressed his desire to invest in Google on the same terms as Ram, even though the seed round was closed and Series A investors like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital were circling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Ram Shriram advocated for [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Bezos]], convincing Larry and Sergey to accept an additional $250,000 of [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Jeff]] and Mackenzie's personal money at the seed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Valuation and Impact

The Series A funding for Google, famously split between John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and Mike Moritz of Sequoia, occurred shortly after [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Bezos's]] investment and valued Google at a $100 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Mike Moritz reportedly commented, "We've never paid so much for so little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The seed valuation, at which Ram and [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Bezos]] invested, is estimated to have been around $10 million or even lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This suggests Ram's initial investment saw a 10x to 20x return by the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

It is estimated that [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Jeff]] and Mackenzie owned at least one percent of Google personally, even after dilution from the Series A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Google famously went public solely on that Series A funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

When Google IPO'd in 2004 with a $23 billion market cap, [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Bezos's]] and Mackenzie's shares would have been worth approximately $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Bezos]] has never publicly commented on whether he and Mackenzie sold their Google shares, but they would not have had the opportunity to sell before the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Since then, Google's value has multiplied by 65 times over the following 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

[[Jeff Bezos wealth from Google investment | This early investment]] provided [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Bezos]] with significant capital for other ventures, including investments in projects like Blue Origin and venture funds such as Benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The ongoing relationship between [[Jeff Bezos early investment in Google | Bezos]] and Ram Shriram, stemming from the Junglee acquisition, highlights the long-term impact of maintaining professional relationships in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

The live Acquired event at the Chase Center featured a significant [[interviews_with_notable_business_figures | interview]] with Mark Zuckerberg, which was described as beyond anything the hosts could have hoped or dreamed for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## An Electric and Unscripted Conversation

During the [[interviews_with_notable_business_figures | interview]], the arena was completely filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Mark was "so on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, creating an "electric" feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. From his first words, Mark threw away the playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, prompting Ben Gilbert to turn off his iPad and switch from a "lean back" to a "lean forward" mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The hosts considered it a potentially "historic conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Candid Discussion on Meta and "20-Year Mistake"

The hosts decided to ask Mark for help with their Meta episode research live on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. A particularly candid moment occurred when asked about criticisms of Facebook/Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Mark stated that the political miscalculation was a "20-year mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This admission, from a public company CEO acknowledging a mistake made eight years prior and being eight years into a 20-year mistake, caused jaws to drop throughout the arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Ben Gilbert highlighted Mark's uniqueness in saying such a thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Charlie Munger expressed strong opinions on the [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture capital]] (VC) industry, noting that while it can be a legitimate business when done correctly, it is often "very poorly done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:02">[02:59:02]</a>.

## Critiques of Modern Venture Capital

Munger believes that investing money well is inherently difficult, and doing so "Time After Time After Time in [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | Venture Capital]]" is "impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:11">[02:47:11]</a>. He views much of the activity in the space as akin to gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:25">[02:51:25]</a>.

### Investor-Founder Relationships
A significant issue Munger points out is the prevalent negative relationship between founders and their VC investors. He observes that founders often "hate the Venture capis" and "don't feel they their partner trying to help them," instead believing VCs are "only taking care of themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:09">[02:59:09]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the [[equality_and_partnership_in_venture_capital | Berkshire Hathaway model]], where companies are not sold off to the highest bidder if they are "halfway decent," fostering a reputation for "staying with things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:04">[03:32:04]</a>.

### Fee Structures and Misaligned Incentives
Munger is highly critical of the fee structures common in the VC world, such as "two and twenty or three and thirty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:15">[03:19:15]</a>. He argues that these fees enable "very handsome loadings" for the fund managers, while endowments and other large pools of capital often do not receive a good return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>. He states that firms should not charge such high fees "unless you really are going to achieve very unusual results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:21">[03:25:21]</a>. Munger suggests that this structure attracts "the wrong people" to the investment field, who act more like investment bankers seeking "hot new areas" rather than being "great investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>. He also asserts that "a lot of [[challenges_and_adaptations_in_venture_capital | venture capital]]s" make money by "screwing their investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>.

### Endowments' Response to High Fees
Munger notes that endowments are beginning to push back against these high fees, telling fund managers they will pay standard fees on a portion of the investment, but then "ride Perry passu" on additional money, effectively reducing fees by "50%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:55">[03:42:55]</a>. This trend is happening "All Over America" as endowments feel "misled" and "irritated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:53">[03:52:53]</a>.

## Investing Landscape and Opportunities

Munger emphasizes the extreme difficulty of finding exceptional investment opportunities in today's market. He states that in a lifetime, one might only get "five, six times" a chance to "know you're right" and "have one that's really going to work wonderfully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:40">[12:41:40]</a>. He advises that when such an "edge" is found, one should "bet heavily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:52">[15:52:52]</a>, a principle not typically taught in business school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:05">[16:03:05]</a>.

### The Difficulty of Finding "Easy Money"
The investing world is now "so far removed from the cigar butt era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:35">[03:16:35]</a>. Munger stresses that "easy money is almost non-existent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:15">[03:54:15]</a>. He states that to achieve unusually good results, three elements are necessary: intelligence, hard work, and luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:59">[03:56:59]</a>. While one cannot arrange for luck, starting early and persisting can increase the chances of encountering a few lucky breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:50">[03:59:50]</a>.

### Market Dynamics and Concentration
Munger believes the concentration of capital in a few large technology companies (like those in the "FANG" or "MAGA" acronyms) was a "natural outcome" driven by "human nature and competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. He observes that all asset classes, including distressed debt and [[venture_capital_and_investing_strategies | venture capital]], are "power law distributed," meaning success comes down to "a few really good decisions with high conviction over an entire career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:04">[04:29:04]</a>.

### Current Investment Climate
Munger concludes that nearly everything in the world is "overpriced," describing the current market as "damn near" impossible and "likely" to remain so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:17">[04:46:17]</a>. He posits that the system nature uses to create intelligence is "unpleasant to the people who are losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:02">[04:59:02]</a>. He suggests that if it continues to get harder, the "natural end is that you have an unpleasant blow up of some kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:06">[04:47:06]</a>. However, he maintains that while there are fewer "bonanzas," opportunities still exist, and one "only have to get rich once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:38">[04:58:38]</a>.

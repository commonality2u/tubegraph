New practices and habits can be injected into a firm to foster curiosity and collective learning, moving beyond traditional strategies that may not be coupled to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. A firm, particularly a venture capital firm, can be understood as a collection of habits, which deeply influence its character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## The Benchmark Dinner Tradition

At [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm_strategies_and_culture | Benchmark]], a specific dinner tradition was established to cultivate these new habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Origin and Purpose
The idea for the dinners originated from Bill Gurley, inspired by a biography of Ben Franklin, who hosted four dinners a week focusing on various deep topics like finance, chemistry, and life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The initial experiment, conducted around late 2006 or 2007, was described as "amazing" and demonstrated how "time stood still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The core purpose of these dinners is to nurture curiosity, which is considered the "essential lifeblood of the firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Unlike typical Monday meetings, these dinners offer an open-ended, no-agenda format for "wild explorations of the most bizarre things" partners might be curious about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This fosters a sense of [[collective_learning_and_curiosity_in_business | constantly learning]] and activating curiosity, leading to a "collective effervescence" that cannot be achieved in one-on-one interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### The Dinner Table Design

A significant element of the tradition is the unique design of the dinner table, located in the office on the 19th floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
Initially designed by Jean-Marie Masoud and later refined by Ole Lundberg based on a hand sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>:

*   **Deconstructing Power Centers:** The table's organic, expandable, and collapsible design aims to destruct or deconstruct traditional power centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. It creates a non-hierarchical construct with intimacy, avoiding the power structures embedded in rectangular tables or the atomization of circular tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **"One Conversation" Ethos:** The table's structure prevents sidebar conversations, ensuring that everyone can hear and participate in a single, unified discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This "one conversation element" is considered powerful because it ensures the entire group is "tuned in" to whatever is being discussed, whether it's good news, tough news, or otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Guests and Impact
The dinners frequently include esteemed outside guests, often individuals the firm hasn't worked with or invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Guests have included notable figures such as:
*   Katarina Fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Mike McHugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Gideon Yu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Martin Mikos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Dylan Field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
*   Toby from Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   Jeff Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

These interactions provide "the spotlight of attention," which is described as the "biggest gift you can give to another human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Attendees often come away inspired, reaffirming the firm's purpose to serve people like these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Firm Principles
This habit underscores a core principle at [[benchmark_venture_capital_firm_strategies_and_culture | Benchmark]]: the rejection of "pre-selling" deals or having side conversations before official meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional venture capital practices where partners might informally lobby for deals prior to a formal discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. At Benchmark, the rule is "no pre-selling a deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

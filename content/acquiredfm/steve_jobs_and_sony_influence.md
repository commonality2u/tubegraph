[[company_profiles_like_nvidia_amazon_and_sony | Sony Corporation]] served as a significant inspiration for Steve Jobs, who openly idolized the Japanese technology giant and modeled Apple Computer after it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His admiration for [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]] and its approach to product design and company culture profoundly influenced Apple's early days and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Jobs' Admiration and the Uniform Story

Steve Jobs' idolization of [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]] is legendary. A notable anecdote revolves around employee uniforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Jobs visited [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]] and observed that their employees wore uniforms, which he found to be a "great idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. He desired Apple to have a similar uniform and made a proposal to Apple, which was rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The origin of [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]]'s uniforms was practical, stemming from clothing scarcity after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

After Apple's refusal, Jobs decided to adopt a personal uniform. He commissioned Issey Miyake, the famous Japanese designer responsible for the [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]] uniform, to create 100 black turtlenecks for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Influence on Product Design and Ecosystem

Jobs' fascination with [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]] extended to its products and business philosophy. John Sculley, former Apple CEO, described Jobs as a "freak about [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]]" and said his admiration was "nearly fetishistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. Jobs even collected [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]] letterhead and marketing materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>.

Jobs was particularly impressed by [[sonys_major_technological_innovations | Sony]]'s ability to create innovative consumer electronics that captivated users. This was evident in products like the [[sonys_major_technological_innovations | Walkman]], which dramatically changed human behavior by enabling portable personal music listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>. Jobs famously dissembled a [[sonys_major_technological_innovations | Walkman]] gifted to him by Akio Morita to study its engineering and construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>.

Akio Morita's philosophy, "I do not believe any amount of market research could have told us that the [[sonys_major_technological_innovations | Sony Walkman]] would be successful," directly mirrors Jobs' later stance on product development, where he asserted that Apple didn't do focus groups because people couldn't tell you what they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. These "Morita-isms" became Jobs-isms in the public consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.

Jobs sought to emulate [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]]'s approach to quality and elegance. He designed the Mac factory to mimic the "super crisp pristine look" and spotless nature of [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]]'s factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. Sculley noted that Jobs "didn't want to be Microsoft, he didn't want to be IBM, he wanted to be [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

Upon Akio Morita's passing in 1999, Steve Jobs began a Macworld keynote by displaying a picture of Morita (who had been featured in Apple's "Think Different" campaign) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>. Jobs acknowledged [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]]'s role in inventing "the whole consumer electronics marketplace," citing products like the transistor radio, Trinitron television, first consumer VCR, [[sonys_major_technological_innovations | Walkman]], and audio CD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.

## Divergent Paths: Software vs. Hardware

While Jobs admired [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]], the two companies took very different paths after the early 2000s. In 2004, both companies had a market cap of approximately \$30 billion and thin net income margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:20">[02:50:20]</a>. However, their trajectories diverged significantly:
*   **[[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]]**: Grew to a market cap of about \$150 billion today, with net income margins increasing to 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:41">[02:50:41]</a>.
*   **Apple**: Skyrocketed to \$2.8 trillion, roughly 19 times [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]]'s value, with twice the net income margin (nearly 26%) and double the revenue growth rate (30% vs. [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]]'s 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:02">[02:51:02]</a>.

This divergence can be attributed to [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]]'s struggle with "software" (which they internally considered content) and "computing" as hardware became increasingly driven by software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>. [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]] failed to integrate its devices into a cohesive ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:16">[02:54:16]</a>. Apple, by contrast, focused on integrating hardware, software, and services into a unified ecosystem, creating seamless experiences and leveraging "pseudo-monopolistic distribution channels like the App Store" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:20">[02:52:20]</a>.

Despite [[sonys_business_and_market_strategy | Sony]]'s historical success in consumer electronics and its consistent innovation in hardware (e.g., [[sonys_major_technological_innovations | image sensors]] for iPhones), it failed to capitalize on the shift towards integrated computing devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:06">[02:13:06]</a>. As products like phones and TVs became more like computers, [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]] struggled to maintain its dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:08">[02:13:08]</a>. The company's diverse portfolio, while financially stable, lacks the overarching strategic focus and synergistic "power" seen in companies like Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:46">[02:37:46]</a>.

Ultimately, while [[history_of_sony_corporation | Sony]] was an initial blueprint for Apple's success, Apple's evolution into a vertically integrated, software-driven ecosystem marked a significant departure, leading to vastly different outcomes for the two companies in the 21st century.

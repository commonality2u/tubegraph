Costco has significant room for future growth through international expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The company began its international journey by establishing a presence in Canada and Mexico, with this expansion becoming a major focus throughout the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. Later, [[the_costco_business_model_and_its_success | Costco]] expanded into the UK, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and most recently, China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:13]</a>.

## Strategy and Adaptation
A key element supporting [[the_costco_business_model_and_its_success | Costco's]] global strategy was the development of its house brand, Kirkland Signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a>. This brand was intentionally designed with a name and trademark that could be cleared across all countries of operation and planned expansion, such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:15">[01:31:15]</a>.

At the time of its entry into Asian markets, there were few other Western retailers attempting to operate there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:27">[01:38:27]</a>. It was not immediately clear if a large warehouse format with bulk packaging would succeed in cultures like Japan, where people often live in densely packed urban environments with smaller homes, unlike the suburban landscapes of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:27">[01:38:27]</a>. Despite these initial uncertainties, [[the_costco_business_model_and_its_success | Costco's]] model has proven highly effective internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:27">[01:38:27]</a>. The fundamental appeal of offering high-quality products at great value resonates globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>.

## Growth Potential
[[the_costco_business_model_and_its_success | Costco]] management periodically expresses surprise at how much room for growth remains in the U.S. market, even opening new stores in cities already served by multiple locations and seeing them perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a>. This suggests that the model is far from saturated domestically.

However, the international market, particularly Asia, Europe, Africa, and Australia, presents even greater "running room" for [[the_costco_business_model_and_its_success | Costco's]] expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:47">[02:42:47]</a>.

### China Expansion
China, in particular, demonstrates incredible pent-up demand for [[the_costco_business_model_and_its_success | Costco's]] offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:48">[02:43:48]</a>. The first [[the_costco_business_model_and_its_success | Costco]] store in China, opened in 2019, rapidly grew to 400,000 members within two years, significantly outpacing the average U.S. store's 68,000 members at maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:57">[02:43:57]</a>.

[[the_costco_business_model_and_its_success | Costco]] has been very deliberate in its China strategy. Despite receiving a permit to open its first store 20 years prior, the company waited until 2019, reflecting a long-term approach to market entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:39">[02:44:39]</a>. All indicators suggest that the concept performs as well as, if not better than, in the U.S., with six stores planned for China within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:19">[02:44:19]</a>. This indicates substantial continued expansion potential in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:37">[02:44:37]</a>.

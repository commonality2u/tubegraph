The relationship between Porsche and Volkswagen is deeply intertwined, marked by periods of close collaboration, family drama, and fierce corporate battles. This complex history has ultimately led to Volkswagen Group (VW) owning the Porsche brand, while the Porsche-Piëch families maintain significant control over VW itself.

## Early Origins and the "Volkswagen" Concept

The founder of Porsche, Ferdinand Porsche, envisioned a "small affordable car that can really become the first German and European Mass Market automobile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This vision, which he conceived while running engineering and car design for Mercedes-Benz for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, was ultimately rejected by the Daimler board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. This rejection led to his acrimonious departure from Daimler in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, and initiated a rivalry that continues to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

In 1931, Ferdinand Porsche started his own consulting firm, "Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>, which is considered the beginning of the Porsche company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. In 1934, this new company secured a contract to design Ferdinand's vision of a "car for the people" – a Volkswagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:20]</a>. This car became the Volkswagen Beetle, and the company that contracted Porsche was Volkswagen, established by Adolf Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. Volkswagen's primary factory and city, Wolfsburg, were also created by Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

## Post-War Separation and Renewed Interdependence

After World War II, Volkswagen's Wolfsburg factory fell under British control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. The British initially planned to dismantle the factory, but Major Ivan Hurst saw the potential of the Beetle and placed an initial order for 20,000 units for the British military, effectively restarting Volkswagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. Volkswagen, having been a political organization, was orphaned with no clear ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

Meanwhile, Ferdinand Porsche and his son-in-law Anton Piëch were imprisoned by the French as war criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>. Ferdinand's son, Ferry Porsche, and his sister Louise (Anton Piëch's wife) began rebuilding the family business in Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>. Their new company, Porsche Construction GmbH, started by fixing military vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>, and later developed the legendary Porsche 356 using many Beetle parts and architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>.

Upon their release in late 1947, Ferdinand and Anton returned to Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>. Volkswagen, now getting back on its feet, proposed a renewed and expanded business relationship. This included:
1.  Reinstating the German Porsche company to do technical design and consulting work for Volkswagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:05]</a>.
2.  Granting the German Porsche company a royalty on every Beetle sold worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:21:00">[35:21:00]</a>.
3.  Granting the Austrian Porsche company (run by Louise and Anton) exclusive rights to distribute Volkswagens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>.

This "sweetheart deal" for the Porsche family was incentivized by the post-war West German government, which sought to rapidly rebuild its industrial base against the backdrop of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:04:00">[42:04:00]</a>. This effectively meant pouring profits back into the industry through tax incentives, rather than allowing them to be taken as income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>.

## Mid-Century Joint Ventures

By the 1960s, as the Porsche 356 started to face competition, Ferry Porsche decided to replace it with a new model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:42:00">[55:42:00]</a>. In 1967, Porsche launched a joint project with Volkswagen to produce a new mid-engined roadster, the 914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>. This car was intended to have both a four-cylinder (VW branded) and a six-cylinder (Porsche branded) version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>.

When a new CEO took over Volkswagen, he decided that a sports car didn't make sense in VW's lineup, and instead, all 914s would be branded Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>. In exchange, Volkswagen took over all of Porsche's distribution in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. This deepening of ties, though not a merger, massively intertwined the two companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. The 914 became a huge success for Porsche, selling 100,000 units in eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

## Family Drama and Piëch's Rise at Volkswagen

In 1970, due to internal family conflicts and succession battles between Ferdinand "Butzi" Porsche (Ferry's son) and Ferdinand Piëch (Louise's son), the families made the surprising decision to completely exit the operational management of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. They would continue to own the company but would no longer manage it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>.

Ferdinand Piëch, having been forced out of Porsche, eventually took over Audi, turning it from a "joke" brand into a legitimate competitor to Mercedes and BMW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>. His success led to his promotion to CEO of Volkswagen in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>, a company far larger than Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>. Under Piëch, Volkswagen significantly expanded its brand portfolio, acquiring Lamborghini, Bugatti, and other European brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:08">[01:22:08]</a>. Piëch was later recognized as the "Car Executive of the Century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>.

## Porsche's Takeover Attempt of Volkswagen (2005-2008)

By the mid-2000s, under the leadership of Wendelin Wiedeking, Porsche experienced immense success, growing its market cap from under €400 million in the early 90s to €32 billion by 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>. With significant profits and a German tax regime incentivizing reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:27">[02:12:27]</a>, Porsche began looking for places to put its cash.

In September 2005, Porsche acquired 20% of the VW group for $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:38">[02:15:38]</a>. Wiedeking aimed for Porsche to acquire Volkswagen, with him at the helm of the combined entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>. Porsche continued to buy VW shares, often using derivatives and options contracts to circumvent the "Volkswagen Law," a German law designed to prevent a hostile takeover of VW (which still had a 20% stake owned by the state of Lower Saxony) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>. Porsche increased its ownership to over 50% by 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:16">[02:19:16]</a>, leveraging €10 billion in cheap debt to fund the acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:50">[02:17:50]</a>.

This aggressive strategy created a short squeeze in VW's stock, briefly making Volkswagen the most valuable company in the world in October 2008, immediately following the Lehman Brothers collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. However, this left Porsche in a precarious position: heavily indebted, unable to refinance its debt amidst the global financial crisis, and unable to sell its VW shares without crashing the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## Volkswagen Acquires Porsche

At this critical juncture, Ferdinand Piëch, still Chairman of the VW board and a family member on the Porsche supervisory board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:10">[02:16:10]</a>, made his move. VW publicly announced that Porsche was no longer financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:54">[02:22:54]</a>. Volkswagen, led by Piëch, then offered to "bail out" Porsche by purchasing the Porsche operating company for a price ranging from €3-4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:59">[02:23:59]</a>.

By January 2009, Wiedeking was ousted as CEO of Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>. Volkswagen eventually acquired the Porsche operating company in two tranches over three years, completing the purchase in 2011 for a total of approximately €8.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:32">[02:24:32]</a>.

## Current Relationship and Future Outlook

Today, Porsche AG (the operating company) is fully owned by Volkswagen Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:52">[02:55:52]</a>. However, the Porsche-Piëch families, through their holding company Porsche SE, emerged from the saga as the largest shareholders in the Volkswagen Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>. They control over 50% of VW's voting power, effectively owning the entire Volkswagen Group, including Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>. In 2022, Porsche AG was re-IPO'd as the largest European IPO of all time, valued at around $75 billion initially, and increasing to about $115 billion within nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:11">[02:40:11]</a>.

Despite the financial separation, the companies remain operationally intertwined, sharing production facilities, distribution networks, and even leadership. Oliver Blume serves as the current CEO of both VW Group and Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:50">[02:42:50]</a>. Many components and engines are shared across VW Group's various brands, including Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, and Audi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:56">[02:50:56]</a>. This scale enables Porsche to offer [[porsches_strategic_decisions_around_product_development | SUVs and other models]] that contribute significantly to its revenue and profitability, while still maintaining its luxury brand image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:52">[02:55:52]</a>.

The history of Porsche and Volkswagen demonstrates a unique dynamic where family ambition, corporate maneuvering, and market forces constantly reshaped their relationship, ultimately leading to a complex ownership structure where the families who founded Porsche now control the much larger Volkswagen empire that owns their original car company.

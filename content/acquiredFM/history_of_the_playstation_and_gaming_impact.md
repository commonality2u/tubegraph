This article chronicles its origin, breakthrough, and long-lasting impact on the gaming industry.

## Origins and the Nintendo Betrayal

The genesis of the PlayStation is steeped in intrigue—a story marked by cooperation and betrayal. 

In 1989, Ken Kutaragi, a senior engineer at Sony, observed the immense potential of the video game market through the lens of his daughter’s fascination with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Realizing the future of video gaming, Kutaragi initiated collaboration with Nintendo, creating a sound chip for Nintendo’s upcoming project, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:14">[01:42:14]</a>.

However, a significant turning point occurred at CES 1991, when Sony announced a collaboration with Nintendo for a combined CD-ROM player and gaming console. Shockingly, the next day, Nintendo revealed a partnership with Philips instead, blindsiding Sony. This betrayal catalyzed Sony’s decision to enter the gaming console market independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>.

## The Birth of PlayStation

Despite internal resistance, Sony pursued the gaming console route, emboldened by Norio Oga’s support of Kutaragi’s vision. Transferred under Sony Music to protect the initiative from internal politics, Kutaragi and his team laid the groundwork for the PlayStation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:10">[01:52:10]</a>.

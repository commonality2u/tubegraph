In the realm of investing, evaluating investment opportunities involves complex decision-making that balances the art of predicting future value against the science of analyzing current data. In a recent episode of the Acquired podcast, investment experts Howard Marks and his son Andrew Marks discussed their approaches to investment opportunities, offering insights into both value and growth investing and how these paradigms intertwine in the modern market.

## The Value-Growth Dichotomy

Howard Marks, co-founder of [[history_and_evolution_of_oaktree_capital | Oaktree Capital Management]], and Andrew Marks, co-founder of [[journey_and_evolution_of_tq_ventures | TQ Ventures]] explored the evolving dichotomy between value and growth investing. Howard Marks' stance has traditionally been aligned with value investing, which focuses on buying securities perceived to be undervalued in relation to their intrinsic worth. Meanwhile, Andrew Marks has gravitated towards growth investing, which targets companies expected to deliver substantial returns by expanding significantly over time.

### Value versus Growth Investing

The contrast between [[different_investment_styles_value_investing_vs_growth_investing | these investing styles]] is more nuanced than a simple binary choice. Howard and Andrew discussed how the modern investing landscape necessitates a blend of both philosophies. As Andrew Marks noted, some of the most successful investments are those where growth potential is realized from an initially undervalued position, and investors must be attuned to when growth opportunities might transform into value opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Factors in Evaluating Opportunities

An essential theme from the discussion was the significance of a deep understanding of a business's fundamentals when evaluating investment opportunities. But beyond just the immediate business economics, investors must consider the future trajectory of a company. Howard Marks emphasized that understanding optional profitability—foregoing current profits to invest in future growth—is crucial. This requires evaluating whether losses today can translate into future gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

### Role of Predictability and Optionality

Predictability of returns remains a core component of value investing, while growth investing often involves navigating uncertainty for potentially higher returns. Howard Marks illustrates this through [[amazons_early_growth_and_business_strategy | Amazon’s journey]], which initially seemed improbable to value investors due to its substantial reinvestments and unpredictable market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. As investors, Howard and Andrew Marks highlighted the importance of evaluating both current business models and the optionality offered by innovative management teams capable of success in future, adjacent verticals.

## Market Evolution and Judgement

The Marks duo reiterated that markets and investment games are evolving, with a notable increase in the speed of technological adoption and market changes. Andrew Marks shared experiences from the early poker scene to draw parallels with investing, illustrating how initial strategies get outpaced by new game dynamics. As markets evolve, so do the winning investment strategies, which now require a more nuanced understanding of varied contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.

## When to Sell

One of the most spirited discussions between Howard and Andrew Marks revolved around the [[the_decisionmaking_process_behind_selling_investments | decision to sell investments]]—a critical yet often under-discussed aspect of investing. Howard Marks admitted to a predisposition towards taking profits and limiting risk, reflecting a traditional, conservative approach. On the other hand, Andrew emphasized the potential regret of selling too early, especially in high-growth scenarios where future appreciation is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.

The episode underscored that selling decisions should be driven by fundamental analysis of future cash flows, the reason for the initial investment, and emerging opportunities elsewhere. Investors must reconcile the temptation of crystallizing gains with the long-term value creation potential of their holdings.

### American Dynamism and Venture Investing

Catherine explained that American Dynamism encompasses companies that either sell directly to the government or operate in heavily regulated industries such as defense [[defense_contracting_industry_dynamics]], aerospace, transportation, and education [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>]. These sectors have historically seen less disruption from software innovation, presenting a ripe opportunity for new technology to make a significant impact [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>].

## Entrepreneurship in Transformative Sectors

Catherine highlighted the necessity for new business models that bridge the gap between software innovation and traditional sectors. This involves cultivating companies that pursue deeper technological integration in areas previously untouched by rapid tech advancements, such as education and housing [[entrepreneurship_and_strategic_risktaking]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>].

### Case Studies: Hadrian and Flock Safety

Meanwhile, Flock Safety specializes in license plate reading technology to aid in crime reduction, illustrating how tech entrepreneurship can directly improve public welfare [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>].

## The Evolving Entrepreneurial Mindset

Ben and David discussed how the mindset for new entrepreneurs is shifting from primarily focusing on SaaS and consumer tech to tackling systemic issues within large industries and public sectors [[challenges_and_business_models_in_ai]]. This transition is fueled by the availability of capital and the broadening definition of what a tech-enabled business can accomplish [[business_strategy_and_technology_impact]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>].

### The Internet-Facilitated Expansion

The decision to sell investments can be as impactful and complex as the decision to buy them. This topic was discussed in depth by Howard and Andrew Marks during their appearance on the [[podcasting_and_media_trends | Acquired podcast]], where they shared contrasting perspectives on the decision to sell and how it fits into their broader investment philosophies.

## Howard Marks' Perspective on Selling

Howard Marks, the legendary value investor, has historically approached selling from a conservative standpoint. His tendency has been to "take some money off the table" as investments appreciate, a mindset influenced by the conservative values he grew up withâ€”such as "don't put all your eggs in one basket" and "save for a rainy day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. This approach is rooted in a desire to avoid the regret and embarrassment of losing unrealized gains.

However, Howard acknowledges that this approach can be limiting, especially in the context of modern investing environments where certain investments have the potential for exponential growth. He highlights [[amazons_market_positioning_and_growth_strategy | Amazon as a prime example]], illustrating how selling too early on the basis of taking profits could lead to missing out on significant long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>.

## Andrew Marks' Approach to Selling

Andrew Marks takes a different view, emphasizing the importance of understanding the underlying reasons for holding an investment and the potential future value it might unlock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>. For him, the decision to sell should be informed by whether the initial reasons for investing still hold true and if there are better opportunities available. Andrew points out that many investors succumb to the urge to act simply because of past price movements, rather than basing decisions on fundamentals or changes in the business's outlook.

He also discusses the potential of investments that can "compound value," suggesting that selling such investments prematurely could be an opportunity lost, especially if they continue to grow significantly in value over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

- **Profound Understanding**: Both Howard and Andrew agree that a deep understanding of the investment and its potential future is crucial in informing the selling decision.
  
- **Opportunity Cost**: Selling should be considered in the context of opportunity cost. The proceeds from a sale must be compared against potential future gains of holding or the returns from alternative investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>.

- **Avoiding Regret**: The Marks emphasize that selling decisions are often driven by a desire to avoid regret, highlighting the importance of aligning those decisions with rational analysis over emotional responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.

- **Long-Term Focus**: There is a significant focus on the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective and how some of the greatest investment gains often come from holding on to exceptional companies over long periods. 

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the decision to sell an investment should be guided by a thoughtful evaluation of the current investment's future potential, the investor's confidence in their initial thesis, and a clear comparison of alternative opportunities. Each investor may apply these principles differently, influenced by their personal investment style and market conditions. The discussion between Howard and Andrew Marks provides valuable insights into the nuanced and subjective nature of selling decisions in the complex world of investing.

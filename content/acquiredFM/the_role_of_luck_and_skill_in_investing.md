In a recent podcast episode featuring renowned investor [[michael_mauboussins_impact_on_investing | Michael Mauboussin]], the intricate balance between luck and skill in the realm of investing was explored in-depth. Mauboussin, who has extensively researched and written on the topic, provides a nuanced perspective that challenges conventional wisdom. Below is a breakdown of his insights, categorized under key themes.

## Defining Skill and Luck

To fully appreciate the interplay between luck and skill in investing, it's crucial to define these terms:

1. **Skill**: As Mauboussin describes, skill is "the ability to apply one's knowledge readily in execution or performance" (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>). In investing, skill involves making informed decisions based on analysis and experience, similar to how [[strategic_investing_perspectives | strategic investing perspectives]] are formulated.

2. **Luck**: Luck is defined by three main attributes: it happens to an individual or organization, it can be good or bad, and it is reasonable to expect that a different outcome could have occurred under similar circumstances (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>).

## The Luck-Skill Continuum

Mauboussin introduces the concept of the luck-skill continuum, suggesting that most activities, including investing, fall somewhere between pure luck and pure skill (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>). He cites examples such as:

- **All Skill, No Luck**: Chess matches, where outcomes are almost entirely dependent on the players’ skills.
- **All Luck, No Skill**: Lottery games, where outcomes are random and independent of the players' actions.

## The Paradox of Skill

A pivotal insight from Mauboussin’s research is the "Paradox of Skill." This paradox posits that as the skill level within a competitive field increases, luck plays a more significant role in differentiating outcomes. This is largely because the relative skill gaps narrow, making luck a more critical factor in distinguishing performance (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>).

## Implications for Investing

In practical terms, this means that even as investors become more skilled (in absolute terms), their relative skill advantage diminishes as markets become more efficient, akin to the dynamics seen in [[investment_strategies_and_market_insights | investment strategies and market insights]]. This can make it appear as though investing results are more a product of luck, despite a high degree of skill being involved overall (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>).

### Persistence of Performance

Interestingly, Mauboussin notes that in certain areas of investing, such as venture capital, there is still a distinct persistence of performance. Top performing venture funds tend to continue outperforming over time, suggesting that skill, and possibly preferential access to deal flows, remains a significant factor (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>). This can be further explored in contexts such as the [[venture_capital_models_and_strategies | venture capital models and strategies]].

## Conclusion

The insights shared by Michael Mauboussin provide a framework for understanding the complex dynamics of skill and luck in investing. While skill is foundational, especially in developing strategies and making informed decisions, luck undeniably influences outcomes. Investors must navigate these elements, recognizing the role that each plays in their successes and failures. In an ever-evolving market landscape where absolute skill is high and relative advantages are thinning, acknowledging the impact of luck is critical for realistic expectations and strategic planning.

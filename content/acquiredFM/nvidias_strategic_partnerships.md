Nvidia, founded in 1993, has positioned itself as a titan in the graphics processing industry, not only through innovation and resilience but also through strategic partnerships that have propelled its growth and market dominance. These collaborations have played crucial roles in Nvidia's adaptation to industry shifts and technological advancements. This article will delve into some of the key strategic partnerships that have defined [[nvidias_history_and_strategic_decisions | Nvidia's trajectory]].

## The Sega Partnership

One of Nvidia's early strategic partnerships was with Sega, aimed at powering their arcade consoles and the forthcoming Sega Saturn home console. This collaboration was crucial for Nvidia, as it enabled the company to gain significant market exposure early in its journey. However, this relationship faced challenges as Nvidia's design choices, such as using quadrilaterals instead of the industry-preferred triangles for 3D rendering, eventually led Sega to reconsider their association. This pivotal moment paved the way for Nvidia to realign its strategy and adopt the industry standards that would allow it to thrive [[nvidias_early_challenges_and_innovations | [00:35:00]]].

## Collaboration with Microsoft

Perhaps the most influential partnership for Nvidia was its engagement with Microsoft. This collaboration arose during the development of the original Xbox. Nvidia was selected as a key supplier for the Xbox, cementing its status as a major player in the gaming industry. The deal was massive, with Nvidia not only securing a $500 million annual contract but also a $200 million advance, providing an essential cash infusion to the company at a critical time [[microsofts_strategy_in_the_pc_market | [01:09:00]]].

Through this partnership, Nvidia developed the GeForce 3 series, introducing programmable shaders and lighting on the GPU for the first time, which proved pivotal in establishing the GPU as a processing unit on par with the CPU. This advancement heralded a new era for game developers, offering increased creative control and enabling more sophisticated graphics [[the_role_of_gaming_technology_in_nvidias_growth_strategy | [01:10:00]]].

## Partnership with TSMC

A defining partnership in Nvidia's manufacturing operations has been with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Jensen Huang, [[jensen_huangs_leadership_and_insights | Nvidia's CEO]], personally approached Morris Chang of TSMC, leading to a longstanding partnership that has seen TSMC become Nvidia's primary foundry. The collaboration has been instrumental in Nvidia's ability to maintain its rapid product release cycles, which initially set it apart from competitors [[morris_chang_and_the_foundation_of_tsmc | [01:02:00]]].

## AMD: A Missed Opportunity Turned Rivalry

In the mid-2000s, AMD considered acquiring Nvidia to bolster its graphics division. Although the deal fell through primarily due to Jensen's insistence on leading the merged entity, it highlights the competitive pressures and strategic interests among the industry's major players. Following this, AMD acquired ATI, setting up a direct competition with Nvidia in the GPU market [[comparison_and_competition_with_other_tech_companies_like_apple_and_google | [01:28:00]]].

## Scientific and Research Partnerships

As Nvidia transitioned towards a broader role in high-performance computing, it began forming alliances with researchers and academic institutions. These collaborations helped Nvidia to apply its graphical processing advancements to areas like scientific computing, further solidifying its reputation as a leader in parallel processing and simulation technologies. This shift laid the groundwork for future advances in areas such as [[ai_and_machine_learning_advancements | machine learning and AI]] [[nvidias_journey_from_gaming_to_ai_and_machine_learning | [01:27:00]]].

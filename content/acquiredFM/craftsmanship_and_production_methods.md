Hermes, a company entrenched in [[history_of_hermes | rich history]] and exceptional craftsmanship, stands as a unique figure in the luxury industry, especially known for its production methods and dedication to traditional craftsmanship.

## The Legacy of Craftsmanship

Founded in 1837 by Thierry Hermès, the company has always placed a primary focus on the quality of its craftsmanship. Even as the company grew, this core tenet did not diminish. Traditionally, Hermes has been associated with horse harnesses and later, with high-end leather goods such as the iconic Birkin and Kelly bags. These pieces aren't just fashion items; they are crafted works of art, meticulously constructed to stand the test of time.

> Hermès artisans train for years to master the intricate saddle stitching that defines their products. This method ensures durability and aesthetic appeal. Each Birkin and Kelly bag is handcrafted by a single artisan, a process that can take up to 20 hours per bag.

## [[history_of_hermes | Production Methods]]: Training and Techniques

The saddle stitch, a hallmark of their craftsmanship, is not only about utility but also represents a deep commitment to tradition. This method, while more time-consuming than machine sewing, results in a more durable product, providing higher quality and longevity. It's a technique that traditionally could only be done by hand or, until recently, exclusively by hand, showcasing the meticulous nature of Hermes products.

### Apprentice Program and Scale

Hermes is known for its unique approach to scaling its craftsmanship. As highlighted in their operations, Hermes has successfully scaled their model of artisanal crafting with 31 workshops or "ateliers" throughout France, each housing no more than 250 to 300 craftsmen. This model ensures that they retain a personal and artisanal touch, despite the brand's global scale.

Their apprentice and training programs are crucial, focusing on locations throughout rural France where unemployment may be high, and training new generations in these traditional skills. They commit to training their artisans and craftsmen in a way that maintains the quality and tradition associated with their products.

## Artisans and the Role of Savoir-Faire

One of the striking aspects of Hermes is its dedication to the "savoir-faire," a French term for a kind of know-how or expertise that's steeped in tradition. The transmission of these skills is seen as integral to the company’s operations. Every artisan is trained to ensure this savoir-faire is passed down and preserved. Hermes also created an official degree-granting program called the Hecole Hermès de Savoir-Faire that centers around this concept, ensuring the traditional skills are passed down properly.<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:25">[02:49:25]</a>

### Products with Soul

Beatrice Amblard, a former artisan at Hermes, speaks to the idea that each product made with an artisan's hands has a soul, a personal touch that distinguishes it from mass-manufactured items. This sentiment encapsulates the ethos at Hermes and why their bags, clothes, and other items often fetch prices and demand appreciation unlike any other.

## Conclusion

Celebrate a fusion of history, quality, and meticulous attention to detail, Hermes stands as a beacon of luxury craftsmanship in the modern world. By maintaining a commitment to traditional methods while innovating thoughtfully, Hermes continues to distinguish itself as a leader not just in luxury fashion but as a custodian of a rich [[brand_strategy_and_power | artisanal heritage]] that defines what it means to create products with true soul.

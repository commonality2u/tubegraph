## Open Source Technology and Its Impact on Meta

Open source technology has been a significant contributor to the evolution and success of many modern technology companies, including Meta. During a recent discussion at the Acquired Live event, Mark Zuckerberg highlighted the pivotal role that open source technology plays in Meta’s operations and strategic positioning, offering insights into why it matters to the company and how it has shaped their technological journey.

### The Foundation of Meta on Open Source

Meta, originally known as Facebook, has been leveraging [[the_role_of_open_source_technology_at_meta | open-source technology]] since its inception. The company's technical foundation was constructed using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), which offered a cost-effective and flexible environment for rapid development and scaling. Mark Zuckerberg acknowledges the critical role open source played in allowing Meta to build efficiently and innovate rapidly in its early stages.

> "We wouldn't have been able to get built without open source... probably true for any new company that's been created since... the late 1990s" - Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:56">[01:40:56]</a>.

### Open Source as a Strategy for Ecosystem Development

As Meta matured, it began to contribute back to the open-source community, turning some of its internal technologies like React and GraphQL into open-source projects. According to Zuckerberg, Meta's position in the market often drove decisions to open-source technology to catalyze broader industry adoption, which in turn benefited Meta by expanding its influence and ecosystem.

> "We get to make [our technology] open and have the supply chain standardized around our designs, which means way more supply, way cheaper to produce" - Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a>.

### Open Compute and AI: Standardizing the Future

One prominent example of Meta's strategic use of open-source is the Open Compute Project, which reshaped hardware designs to become more efficient and cost-effective. This initiative has saved Meta billions of dollars and enhanced the quality of their infrastructure.

In AI, open source plays a crucial role too. Meta's approach to AI involves open collaboration, releasing models like [[generative_ai_and_large_language_models_llms | LLaMA to the public]], which allows for a community-driven development process, enhancing the models and making them more competitive.

> "AI is not like pieces of software that are monolithic—they're ecosystems... the big technology platforms... these things are best as open" - Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>.

### Balancing Open and Closed Systems

While appreciating the benefits of open source, Zuckerberg also acknowledges that not all projects within Meta are open-sourced, emphasizing the company’s balanced approach. Meta does not adhere strictly to open-source principles but instead evaluates the strategic benefits of open source against maintaining proprietary control.

> "We do a lot of Open Source stuff we do a lot of Closed Source stuff I'm not like a zealot on this" - Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>.

### Future Vision: Open Platforms as a Strategic Advantage

Looking ahead, Meta aims to use [[facebook_and_the_metaverse_strategy | open platforms as a strategic advantage]] against competitors like Apple. Zuckerberg envisions a future where open platforms can drive a more vibrant technology industry and enable the kind of systemic innovation needed to propel Meta forward in the realms of [[metas_strategy_for_future_technologies_such_as_ar_and_ai | AI, augmented reality, and beyond]].

> "My goal for the next 10–15 years... is to build the next generation of open platforms and have them win" - Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:26">[02:17:26]</a>.

### Conclusion

Open-source technology remains a critical backbone and strategic tool for Meta as it navigates the rapidly evolving technological landscape. By continuing to engage with and contribute to open-source communities, Meta not only strengthens its technological foundation but also aligns itself for future growth in an increasingly interconnected and competitive industry. The dedication to both harnessing and advancing open-source technologies underscores Meta's commitment to innovation and leadership across various tech domains.

Vanta is a leader in the automated security and compliance software space, significantly streamlining the processes required for companies to achieve essential compliance certifications like SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR. In a conversation on the Acquired podcast, the company's CEO and co-founder, Christina Cacioppo, elaborated on Vanta’s offerings and its new feature, Vanta Trust Reports, which furthers the company's mission to enhance security and compliance ([00:01:31](#00:01:31)).

## Vanta Overview

Vanta has established itself as a valuable partner for companies aiming to quickly and efficiently achieve security compliance. By automating the complex and often tedious aspects of compliance, Vanta helps organizations avoid the pitfalls of manual processes, which are not only time-consuming but also prone to errors ([00:01:02](#00:01:02)).

## Vanta Trust Reports

A key development discussed in the podcast is Vanta’s Trust Reports. Initially, Vanta experimented with an early version of these reports back in 2017, before the market was ready. The original attempt was to create a report that showcased best security practices organizations adhered to regularly. However, the market predominantly demanded SOC 2 compliance at that time ([00:02:54](#00:02:54)).

Flash forward to 2022, Vanta has successfully launched Trust Reports, a system that not only aids companies in preparing for compliance but also in maintaining a live and continuously updating snapshot of their security posture. These reports provide transparency into a company’s current security practices and allow them to demonstrate ongoing compliance to customers and partners at any given time. Unlike a traditional SOC 2 audit, which is typically performed annually, Vanta Trust Reports are updated to the minute, ensuring stakeholders have access to the most current data ([00:03:56](#00:03:56)).

## Advantages Over Traditional Compliance Methods

The traditional path to obtaining and maintaining SOC 2 compliance is arduous—generally completed once per year and only updated annually. Vanta revolutionizes this by offering continuous updates, which can deepen trust with partners and clients due to their real-time nature. This shift allows companies to move beyond static PDFs to dynamic representations of their security states that can be accessed any time ([00:03:49](#00:03:49)).

Vanta's approach to compliance not only makes the process more efficient but also enhances the security posture of organizations by ensuring they continuously adhere to best practices. This proactive method helps companies grow their business by establishing trust with stakeholders through transparency and ongoing diligence in maintaining security standards ([[security_and_compliance_in_startups | security and compliance in startups]]) ([00:03:34](#00:03:34)).

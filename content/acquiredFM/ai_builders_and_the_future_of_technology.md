From: [[acquiredFM]] <br/> 
In recent years, the technology landscape has undergone a significant transformation, largely driven by the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the roles played by AI Builders. Clem Delong, CEO of Hugging Face, offers valuable insights into this paradigm shift and the future trajectory of technology development [[transformation_of_the_technology_industry]].

## The Rise of AI Builders

AI Builders represent a new class of technology creators unique to the AI era. Unlike traditional software engineers who primarily wrote code, AI Builders focus on training models using datasets and creating AI applications. As Clem Delong described, "the way you create technology is by training models using data sets and building AI apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Hugging Face, a prominent platform for AI development, has become a central hub for these builders. With over 5 million AI Builders utilizing the platform, Hugging Face facilitates the sharing of models and datasets, echoing the collaborative ethos reminiscent of GitHub but uniquely tailored for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> [[the_evolution_of_hugging_face_and_its_impact]].

## A New Technological Paradigm

The move from traditional code-based development to model training signifies a broader shift in technological paradigms, which Clem believes should be termed "Software 2.0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. This shift not only empowers the creation of advanced applications but also unlocks capabilities previously thought impossible, potentially leading toward discussions on superintelligence and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> [[ai_and_machine_learning_advancements]].

## Building Blocks for the Future

Clem Delong emphasizes that while the term "AI" evokes futuristic concepts, the current trajectory of model development provides foundational building blocks toward future advancements like AGI. However, he stresses that current models are more a progression of software development rather than steps toward sci-fi scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a> [[enterprise_adoption_of_ai_and_nvidias_positioning]].

## Empowering AI Development

Hugging Face exemplifies the open-source approach, allowing AI Builders to access tools and collaborate on model development. The platform has already facilitated the sharing of over 3 million models, datasets, and apps, and continues to grow with new creations every 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> [[open_source_versus_closed_source_ai]].

The collaborative framework, similar to what GitHub offers for code, enables larger teams to work together and even companies like Microsoft and Nvidia to develop privately and publicly using the platform's resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> [[nvidias_role_in_the_ai_revolution]].

## The Role of AI Builders in Society

As the field of AI matures, there is a greater need for more AI Builders. Clem envisions a future where the number of AI Builders could exceed that of traditional software engineers, potentially reaching 50 million to 100 million builders. This will not only facilitate more inclusive and diverse technological development but also align more closely with societal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a> [[ai_democratization_and_societal_implications]].

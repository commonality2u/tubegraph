With the rise of platforms such as Substack and Twitter, independent content creators have seen unprecedented opportunities to reach global audiences and monetize their work. In a recent discussion on the *Acquired* podcast with Packy McCormick, founder of the popular "Not Boring" newsletter, the transformative role of these platforms was explored in depth.

## Substack: Empowering Writers

Substack has become a pivotal tool for writers looking to establish themselves independently. McCormick highlights how the platform provides a space where writers can monetize their content through subscriptions without the interference of traditional publishers. It's designed for subscriptions, yet he uses it with an advertising model, leveraging Substack's infrastructure without paying a cent due to its percentage-based subscription fee model not applying to his ad-based setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.

## Twitter: The Modern-Day Network Effect

Twitter serves as a dynamic platform for building an audience and networking. McCormick attributes part of his rapid growth to Twitter, where he engages with his audience and shares his articles. The platform is not just a tool for dissemination but also a feedback loop, providing immediate engagement records, amplifying reach, and fostering community discussions around his topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:10">[02:07:10]</a>.

## The Role of AngelList and Venture Capital

Beyond content creation, platforms like AngelList have transformed how [[venture_capital_models_and_strategies | venture capital]] operates for independent creators. McCormick describes how AngelList offers comprehensive support, allowing him to run "Not Boring Capital" effectively as a solo capitalist. This support transforms the traditional venture model by handling back-office operations seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:56">[02:11:56]</a>.

## Balancing Independence with Platform Dependency

While these platforms offer valuable tools, they also present challenges. Being tied to a platform can risk dependency on its future viability and changes. For creators like McCormick, maintaining independence is crucial for preserving content authenticity and creator autonomy.

## Conclusion

The intersection of technology platforms and independent content creation has opened vast opportunities for individual creators. By offering powerful tools and global reach, platforms like Substack, Twitter, and AngelList are reshaping the landscape, enabling creators not just to share their voices but also to build sustainable businesses around their passions. However, this paradigm also requires balancing platform benefits with a strategic approach to maintain independence and leverage each tool's potential for scaling impactful, niche-focused content.

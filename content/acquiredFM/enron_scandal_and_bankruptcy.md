The story of Enron serves as one of the most significant accounting scandals in American corporate history. Enron, once lauded as the pioneer of a [[deregulation_and_innovation_in_the_energy_market | new business model]] and a powerhouse in the American energy industry, collapsed in late 2001, marking a catastrophic end to what was thought to be a high-flying company. This event prompted widespread regulatory reforms and shattered the facade of many involved parties. 

## Enron's Rise to Power

Enron was formed in 1985 through the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, quickly ascending to become the seventh largest company in the United States by market capitalization. It was heralded as Fortune Magazine's "most Innovative company" for six consecutive years, the last of which was in 2001, the year it filed for bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The company was recognized as a trailblazer in [[corporate_ethics_and_lessons_from_enron | energy trading]] and commodities services, with its trading practices often compared to financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## The Scandal Unfolds

Despite its public acclaim, Enron was embroiled in a complex web of accounting fraud aimed at concealing the massive debts and losses within its ledger. The crux of Enron's fraudulent practices lay in its use of [[market_to_market_accounting | mark-to-market accounting]], which allowed it to book potential future profits as current revenue—thereby inflating profits on the income statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. 

Enron further employed [[special_purpose_entities_and_financial_manipulation | special purpose entities (SPEs)]] to hide debt while misleading the balance sheets. These SPEs required just 3% of outsider capital to a maximum of 97% assumed by Enron, effectively moving debt off its main financial statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. This exploitation went largely unnoticed until internal and external pressures, including journalist scrutiny, short-seller alerts, and the tech market bubble burst, unveiled the over-leveraging and unsound practices beneath Enron's commercial empire.

The first glimpses of Enron’s shaky foundation came to light through journalist investigations, notably by Bethany McLean at Fortune, who questioned Enron's opaque financial records in an article titled "Is Enron Overpriced?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:46">[01:51:46]</a>. At around the same time, noted short-seller Jim Chanos began investigating inconsistencies within Enron's financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:10">[01:56:10]</a>.

## Downfall and Bankruptcy

The downfall of Enron escalated when its Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey Skilling, departed unexpectedly in August 2001, just months into the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:27">[02:01:27]</a>. The abrupt resignation provoked further blows to investor confidence, fueling a rapid decline in stock prices. Following Skilling's resignation, Kenneth Lay resumed the CEO role but was unable to stabilize the company.

In October 2001, Enron was forced to admit it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million between 1997 and 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:57">[02:17:57]</a>. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated an investigation, ensuring the saga was far from over.

Enron ultimately filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001, marking the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history at that time with debts of over $63 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:19">[02:30:19]</a>.

## Aftermath and Regulatory Reforms

The Enron scandal was a wake-up call for regulatory bodies and highlighted the need for an overhaul in corporate governance and accounting standards. This led to the enactment of the [[corporate_ethics_and_lessons_from_enron | Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002, which imposed stricter regulatory controls on public companies to protect investors from fraudulent financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:55">[03:17:55]</a>.

The legacy of Enron's collapse is a complex landscape of changed laws, the demise of the [[corporate_ethics_and_lessons_from_enron | Arthur Andersen]] accounting firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:31">[02:16:31]</a>, and a cautionary tale that serves as a constant reminder of the vulnerabilities within corporate ethics and governance.

Mars Inc, one of the largest privately-owned companies globally, boasts a rich history intertwined with innovation, remarkable strategic decisions, and an intricate web of family drama. From its foundation and development through the stewardship of the Mars family, the company's journey is both thrilling and complex.

## Early Foundations

The story begins with Frank C. Mars, who was born in 1883 in Minnesota. Despite being afflicted with polio in childhood, Frank found solace in making candy with his mother, Elva. This early interest in confectionery set the stage for the establishment of his first candy company in Minneapolis in 1902 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

However, Frank's early ventures faced repeated failures. After failed businesses in Minneapolis, Seattle, and Tacoma, he returned to Minneapolis in 1920, founding the Mar-O-Bar Company. This company would eventually become Mars Inc. He struck gold with the Milky Way, created in 1923 by incorporating malted milkshake flavors inspired by suggestions from his son, [[influence_of_historical_figures_on_modern_entrepreneurship | Forest Mars Sr.]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>.

## Family Drama and Corporal Rivalries

### The Estranged Son: Forest Mars Sr.

Frank's first marriage yielded a son, [[challenges_and_advice_for_company_founders | Forest Mars Sr.]], who would become a pivotal figure in the company. Forest was estranged from Frank after his parents' divorce in 1910. He was sent to Canada, only reconnecting with his father years later during a chance meeting when he was 19. Forest's entrepreneurial prowess began showing when he advised Frank on developments that would lead to the Milky Way bar's creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>.

Forest's ambitions were unmatched, but his relationship with Frank was rocky. Following a dispute over the direction of the company, Forest departed to Europe around 1932, determined to prove himself by establishing his own business empire. In England, he launched the Mars bar, adapting it to British tastes and begun a successful foray into pet food with the acquisition of the Chapel Brothers' business [[mars_incs_global_strategy_and_expansion | and]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>.

### Reclaiming the Empire

Meanwhile, back in the United States, after Frank died in 1934, Mars Inc was in the hands of Frank's second wife, Ethel V. Mars, and Forest's half-sister Patricia. Forest returned to the US in 1939 with strategic plans, including forming the iconic M&M's with a [[importance_of_partnerships_in_business | partnership]] involving Hershey's own William Murray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

Following Ethel's death in 1945, a battle of wills ensued, with Patricia and her husband leading Mars Inc. on one path and Forest carving out another. Bringing pressure on his half-sister and the company's management, Forest eventually gained control, turning Mars Inc into [[transformation_of_the_technology_industry | a more modern, globally expansive company]], famous for industrial and strategic advancements like vertical integration and brand globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:21">[01:57:21]</a>.

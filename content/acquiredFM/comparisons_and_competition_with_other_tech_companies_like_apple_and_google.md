In a recent interview with Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, a significant portion of the discussion revolved around the competitive landscape in the tech industry, particularly focusing on Apple's integrated approach and Google's decision to keep certain technologies proprietary. This sheds light on Meta's strategic positioning and its historical and envisioned competition.

## Background and Evolution

In the journey of evolving from Facebook to Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has consistently emphasized the company's identity as a technology company focused on human connections rather than a mere social networking platform. This broader vision shapes how Meta competes with tech giants like Apple and Google, known for their distinct approaches in the tech ecosystem.

## Google: The First Mover in Distributed Computing

Meta's relationship with open-source technology offers a particular contrast with Google. As Zuckerberg noted, Google was the first large-scale tech company to build distributed computing infrastructure, choosing to keep these technologies proprietary as a competitive advantage. In contrast, Meta adopted an open-source approach, not just to match Google's prowess but to create industry standards that could drive wider adoption and improve quality through community collaboration. This resonates with the principles of [[open_source_versus_closed_source_ai]].

> “Google was the first of the great companies building distributed computing infrastructure... We built it too, but we decided, not an advantage for us... might as well just make it open.” — Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[33:40]</a>

This understanding led to Meta's significant contributions to open-source projects, including Open Compute, which has standardized various supply chains, reduced costs, and enhanced the quality of infrastructure for Meta and others in the industry.

## Apple: The Closed and Integrated Model

Apple's iPhone has set a precedent for a closed, integrated architecture, dominating as the intellectual leader in the mobile ecosystem despite the larger number of Android device users. Meta's pursuit of an open platform model contrasts sharply with Apple's closed-system philosophy, an ideological conflict between openness and integration, much like the discourse in [[facebook_and_the_metaverse_strategy]].

> “Apple is a bigger competitor than people realize... It's not just about product competition but deeply about values-driven and ideological competition around what the future should be.” — Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[69:01]</a>

Zuckerberg views the competition with Apple not merely as a product rivalry but as a fundamental ideological battle over technology's openness and accessibility—whether platforms should be closed and integrated like Apple's or open and participatory, which is the path Meta aims to champion.

## Strategic Implications for Meta

With Meta's focus on AR glasses and Reality Labs, the company hopes to define the next generation of open tech platforms that could rival Apple's closed ecosystem. Zuckerberg believes owning the platform could significantly increase Meta's profitability by reducing reliance on third-party frameworks that limit product offerings and thereby lower potential earnings. This aligns with [[metas_strategy_for_future_technologies_such_as_ar_and_ai]].

## Conclusion

The competitive dynamics between Meta, Google, and Apple reflect differing philosophical approaches to technology and platform development. While Google has historically leveraged proprietary technology to maintain a competitive edge, Apple's control over its ecosystems has set industry standards for closed systems. Meta's commitment to open-source principles and its investment in AR and AI demonstrate its strategy to shape a future where openness fosters innovation and broader technological advancement.

These strategic choices continue to underpin Meta's efforts to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. As Zuckerberg indicates, the ideological and platform battles with these tech giants are far from over, marking an ongoing narrative of innovation and competition.

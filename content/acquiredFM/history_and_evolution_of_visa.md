## The Birth of Visa: The 1958 Fresno Drop

The origins of Visa trace back to 1958 in Fresno, California, with the launch of a project by Bank of America called the **"Fresno Drop"**. It marked the first major bank-issued credit card initiative wherein 65,000 unsolicited credit cards were mailed to residents in Fresno. Bank of America created the **BankAmericard**, laying the groundwork for Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Expansion and Formation of Visa

By >1966, Bank of America expanded the service, franchising the BankAmericard system to other banks, which allowed them to issue the cards under their own brands. This evolution required creating a robust network to handle interbank transactions, ultimately leading to the formation of National BankAmericard Inc., the precursor to Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. 

## D Hawk's Vision and Organizational Innovations

Dee Hock, a key figure in Visa's story, saw the potential of creating a universal payment system connecting banks, merchants, and customers.

## Technological Innovations: The Bedrock of Visa’s Success

Visa's path to becoming a global powerhouse is equally a technological revolution. The establishment of the **BankAmericard Authorization System Experimental (BASE I)** in 1971 laid the foundation for digital transaction processing, followed by the development of a settlement infrastructure, further transforming the financial landscape [[technological_innovations_in_payment_processing | in payment processing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:25">[01:57:25]</a>.

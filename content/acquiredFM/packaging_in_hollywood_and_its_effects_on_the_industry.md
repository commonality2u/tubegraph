Packaging within Hollywood refers to the creation of film and television projects by assembling various critical components such as scripts, directors, stars, and other elements before these bundles, or "packages," are presented to studios and networks for financing and distribution. This strategy is highlighted by the practices of the [[history_and_impact_of_creative_artists_agency | Creative Artists Agency (CAA)]] under the leadership of [[michael_ovitzs_influence_in_hollywood_and_caa | Michael Ovitz]], and it has significantly altered the power dynamics within the entertainment industry.

## The Emergence of Packaging

Packaging as a tactic gained prominence partly due to Michael Ovitz and the rise of CAA during the late 20th century. When Ovitz and his co-founders established CAA, they started with minimal client lists and relied heavily on building relationships to assemble packages of talent and ideas into sellable properties to studios [00:34:01]. By controlling these elements, CAA transformed how deals were made in Hollywood.

## Shifting Power Dynamics

- **Before CAA's Influence:**
  The traditional Hollywood studio system was somewhat akin to sports leagues, with studios owning complex contractual rights over talent, directors, and screenplay writers who functioned like players under team control. Studios handled their own development and casting processes [[the_role_of_nfl_players_association_and_collective_bargaining_agreements | similar to collective bargaining in sports]] [00:21:41].

- **After CAA's Packaging Approach:**
  Ovitz's strategy involved not selling any piece of material "naked" or without additional creative elements. Instead, CAA offered complete packages wherein various project facets were controlled by talent represented by one agency. This allowed CAA to set terms favorably for their clients as studios, reduced to acting mainly as distributors, had little choice but to accept the packages to have access to top-tier content [00:33:03]. 

This approach underscored the shift in power from studios to talent agencies, particularly for high-profile projects like "Jurassic Park" which grossed over a billion dollars worldwide [[impact_of_social_media_on_market_dynamics | highlighting the influence of strategic packaging]] [00:16:34]. CAA's packaging model ensured that talent held significant participations in their projects' profits, changing the economic dynamics from a simple "pay-for-hire" model to profit participation on the backend [[entrepreneurship_and_venture_capital | illustrating entrepreneurship principles]] [00:23:02].

## Economic and Creative Impact

- **Economic Advantage:**
  The packaging model developed by CAA resulted in actors, directors, and writers benefiting significantly from the revenue of their projects, thereby substantially increasing their cumulative earnings over time. High-profile talents like directors and writers commanded a considerable share of profits from major blockbusters [[investment_strategies_and_market_insights | reflecting investment strategy dynamics]] [00:24:55].

- **Creative Influence:**
  By aligning the interests of multiple creatives with those of the agency and packaging their combined work into a single offering, CAA fostered an environment ripe for peer collaboration. This led to projects like "Heat," featuring Al Pacino and Robert De Niroâ€”major actors who CAA signed at a time when it was unprecedented for competitors like them to work together on the same project [[importance_of_partnerships_in_business | showcasing the importance of partnerships]] [01:18:15].

## Conclusion

The method of packaging revolutionized the Hollywood industry by redistributing power from large production studios to talented creators and their agencies. While it stimulated creative synergies and increased the shared financial success of films and series' principals, it also challenged the old guard of the studio system, setting the stage for the modern landscape of entertainment today where talent agencies play a pivotal role in the development and success of media properties [[modern_media_and_the_creator_economy | influencing the creator economy]].

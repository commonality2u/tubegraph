## The Role of Security and Compliance

Security and compliance have evolved as crucial components for tech companies. It's no longer sufficient to check regulatory boxes; companies need proactive strategies to demonstrate their security reliability to both existing and potential customers.

## Growth and Market Penetration Strategies

The episode highlighted the inventive strategies tech companies used to rise above the competitive fray.

Moreover, the role of tech companies in strategically managing demand was exemplified by the inventive approaches adopted by some, such as dynamically adjusting prices to balance demand.

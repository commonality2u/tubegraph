In the world of investing, two primary philosophies often challenge and complement each other: value investing and growth investing. These strategies have distinct methods, goals, and thought processes, which investors use to build their portfolios, assess market opportunities, and manage risk. A recent episode of the Acquired Podcast featuring Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, and his son Andrew Marks, co-founder of TQ Ventures, provides a unique insight into these divergent investment styles. Below, we explore their perspectives and how these strategies have evolved and intersected over time.

## Value Investing

Value investing involves seeking out stocks that are undervalued by the market — those that are priced lower than their intrinsic value based on fundamental analysis. Howard Marks, a legendary figure in value investing, emphasizes the importance of buying assets at a discount to avoid permanent capital loss and achieve a margin of safety. This philosophy is rooted in the principles of legendary investor Benjamin Graham and is characterized by a conservative approach focusing on tangible, current cash flows and assets.

Marks discussed how value investing is traditionally associated with predictability and lower risk. This approach is relatively cautious, often seeking companies stable in earnings with undervalued balance sheets and strong fundamental metrics. By buying "dollars for fifty cents," a term famously used by Warren Buffett, value investors aim to avoid excessive speculation and rely on the intrinsic worth of the investment.

## Growth Investing

Growth investing, on the other hand, focuses on companies expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies. Andrew Marks represents this strategy at TQ Ventures, where the emphasis is placed on the potential future earnings, often at the expense of current profits. Growth investors are often drawn to sectors like technology, where companies reinvest profits to fuel expansion and innovation, betting on long-term capital appreciation over short-term gains.

As outlined during the podcast discussion, growth investing requires an optimistic view of the market. It demands an understanding of market trends, competitive advantages, and the potential for businesses to disrupt industries. Andrew Marks underlined the importance of qualitative assessments about the future, recognizing that many successful growth companies require patience and a higher tolerance for volatility.

## Convergence and Debate

Both Howard and Andrew Marks explore the intersection of these philosophies, suggesting that successful investing need not strictly adhere to one style. During the pandemic, they co-authored a memo discussing the shifting investment landscape, questioning the rigid dichotomy between value and growth investing.

The discussion pointed out that market conditions often blur the lines between growth and value. Today's rapidly changing economic environment requires investors to be flexible and open-minded, combining elements of both strategies to identify opportunities and manage risks effectively.

In conclusion, while value and growth investing have traditionally been viewed as opposing strategies, the realities of modern markets often require a nuanced approach that incorporates elements of both. Investors should consider how these strategies align with their own risk tolerance, market outlook, and the evolving economic landscape. As Howard and Andrew Marks demonstrate, successful investing hinges on understanding both the present and the future — melding the stability of value with the dynamism of growth.

Microsoft, a name synonymous with computing and technology, had humble beginnings in the mid-1970s. The company's inception and initial journey are riveting tales woven with vision, ambition, and a bit of serendipity. This article delves into the formative years of Microsoft and how it climbed to its eminent position in the [[transformation_of_the_technology_industry | tech world]].

## The Early Years of Bill Gates

The story of Microsoft is inseparably linked to its co-founder, [[influence_of_historical_figures_on_modern_entrepreneurship | Bill Gates]]. Born in 1955 in Seattle, Washington, Gates was the son of a prominent attorney and a powerful businesswoman. Growing up in a household that frequently hosted influential business figures, Gates was exposed to intricate business discussions from an early age, which undoubtedly shaped his future entrepreneurial pursuits. His mother, Mary Gates, was particularly influential, serving on numerous powerful boards in the Pacific Northwest, and his father, Bill Gates Sr., was a respected lawyer and co-founding partner of a major law firm, K&L Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## The Meeting with The Altair 8800

The pivotal moment in Microsoft's early history was triggered by the cover of the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which featured the Altair 8800, a microcomputer created by MITS. This moment electrified Gates and his co-founder, Paul Allen. Recognizing the revolutionary potential of the Altair, they saw an opportunity to adapt the BASIC programming language for the nascent microcomputer. In a bold move, they contacted Ed Roberts, the head of MITS, and offered to write the BASIC interpreter, despite not having a single line of code written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

## Formation of Microsoft

Gates and Allen promptly developed a prototype and demonstrated it successfully. This achievement led to the creation of their fledgling company, which they named "Microsoft" – a portmanteau of "microcomputer" and "software" – on April 4, 1975. The name reflected their commitment to software development for microcomputers. Initially, it was a two-man partnership with Gates holding 60% and Allen 40% of the equity [[importance_of_partnerships_in_business | partnership dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>.

## Settling in Albuquerque and the MITS Deal

Microsoft's first office was set up in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a decision largely influenced by the proximity to MITS. The deal with MITS to bundle their BASIC interpreter with the Altair provided initial financial security. However, the exclusive nature of the contract and rampant software piracy curtailed early revenue growth, prompting Gates to pen the famous "Open Letter to Hobbyists," decrying software piracy and [[corporate_ethics_and_lessons_from_enron | establishing an early stance on software ownership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

## Defining the Business Model

A significant turning point was Microsoft's re-negotiation of their contract with MITS, which allowed Microsoft to license their software to other manufacturers. This flexibility would prove vital as it set the stage for Microsoft's scalable licensing model that became central to its [[business_strategy_and_technology_impact | business strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.

## Growth and Relocation to Seattle

By 1979, Microsoft was ready to expand. Gates and Allen decided to relocate to Seattle to better attract talent and anticipate future growth needs. This move was strategic, taking advantage of Seattle's burgeoning tech ecosystem and the proximity to [[comparisons_and_competition_with_other_tech_companies_like_apple_and_google | significant tech hubs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

The early days of Microsoft are a testament to the foresight and determination of its founders. Despite the challenges of an evolving industry and the nascent stage of personal computing, Gates and Allen's decisions laid a foundation that would eventually support the world's most valuable company. Their journey from a small two-man venture to a tech giant is an inspiring story of [[entrepreneurship_and_strategic_risktaking | innovation, risk]], and strategic evolution.

Costco's business model is often lauded for its simplicity and its focus on delivering value to the consumer. A key component of this model is the membership system, which not only drives significant revenue but also aligns with Costco’s overarching strategy of providing quality products at the lowest possible prices [[costcos_business_model_and_innovations | Learn more about Costco's business model and innovations]].

## Membership Structure

Costco operates under a two-tier membership system. The base level membership is priced at $60 per year, while an upgraded Executive Membership is available for $120 per year [[the_history_and_business_model_of_costco | Read more about Costco's history and business model]]. This upgraded membership offers additional benefits like 2% cash back on purchases (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[1:54:00]</a>).

## Economic Impact of Membership

### Revenue Generation

One often-discussed facet of Costco's financial success is how much of its profit derives from membership fees [[operational_strategies_and_culture_at_costco | Explore operational strategies and culture at Costco]]. Although Costco’s merchandise business operates at very thin margins, the membership fees provide a substantial part of its operating income. Approximately 70% of Costco’s operating income is generated from membership fees (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:01">[1:51:01]</a>).

### Customer Loyalty and Retention

Membership fees also impact customer behavior. Because consumers have paid for access, they are more likely to shop at Costco to justify their membership expenditure [[comparison_of_retail_models_costco_vs_walmart_and_amazon | Compare Costco's retail model with Walmart and Amazon]]. This prepayment essentially commits them to Costco as a primary shopping venue. Additionally, Costco posts impressive renewal rates—93% in the U.S.—that underpin a stable and predictable revenue stream from memberships alone (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[1:58:00]</a>).

### Selection of Customer Base

Interestingly, the membership model also inadvertently selects for wealthier customers. The requirement to purchase items in bulk and store them implies that customers are not only cash flow positive enough to pay upfront fees but also have the space to store bulk purchases. As such, Costco's typical customer has a higher income and educational level than the national average (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[1:20:18]</a>).

## The Executive Membership Upsell

The Executive Membership presents an interesting facet of Costco's membership strategy. This membership offers 2% cash back on purchases [[history_and_origins_of_costco | Discover the origins and history of Costco]], making it an attractive option for regular shoppers. Importantly, if members do not recoup the additional $60 cost through cash back, Costco will refund the difference, providing a risk-free upgrade for members (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[1:54:52]</a>).

As of recent figures, about 55% of U.S. members opt for Executive Memberships, and these members account for 73% of sales, further illustrating the efficacy of this tier in encouraging higher spend among loyal customers (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:27">[1:56:27]</a>).

## Conclusion

Costco's membership economics are central to its success. More than just a fee, the membership model creates a self-reinforcing cycle of customer loyalty, stable revenue, and a growing customer base willing to shop in bulk [[the_history_and_business_model_of_costco | Uncover more about Costco's business and history]]. This system exemplifies Costco's broader strategy of aligning every aspect of its business model towards incredible value and shareholder returns. As one executive put it, Costco’s aim is selling high-quality products at a lower cost than everyone else—an endeavor greatly facilitated by its membership model (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:30">[2:23:30]</a>).

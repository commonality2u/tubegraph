Michael Ovitz's influence in Hollywood is monumental, particularly through his [[michael_ovitzs_transition_from_caa_to_other_ventures | founding of the Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 1975]]. CAA redefined how talent agencies operated in the film and television industry, establishing themselves as a powerhouse that altered the dynamics of Hollywood. This article explores Ovitz's impact and the role of CAA in transforming the entertainment landscape.

## Founding and Philosophy of CAA

CAA was established in 1975 by Michael Ovitz and four other young agents from the William Morris Agency. They shared a vision to change the way talent agencies managed their clients, moving away from the traditional, fragmented approach. The group of five broke away due to philosophical disagreements over the direction of the business at William Morris, as they were more interested in future talents like Sean Connery and Dustin Hoffman rather than the established names of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.

This setup ensured that clients received comprehensive support and guidance, maximizing the potential for successful projects and career growth [[diversification_of_talent_representation_at_caa | by diversifying talent representation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.

## Changing the Power Dynamics

Michael Ovitz and CAA shifted the power dynamics of Hollywood by creating pre-packaged deals, a method that ensured CAA's clients gained significant participatory stakes in their projects. By packaging directors, actors, and screenwriters into ready-to-produce projects, CAA held more negotiating power with studios, effectively treating them as distribution entities rather than content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

### The Jurassic Park Story

One of the most storied successes under Ovitz's leadership was *Jurassic Park*. [[packaging_in_hollywood_and_its_effects_on_the_industry | CAA's unique packaging approach]] allowed the project to proceed even before the book was published. Ovitz leveraged personal relationships and a keen understanding of the dynamics in Hollywood to get Steven Spielberg on board without a distributor or financing in place. The film's massive success highlighted CAA's ability to command extensive creative and financial control over major projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Influence Beyond Film

Ovitz didn't restrict CAA’s influence to just film; he expanded the agency into advertising and investment banking realms. This expansion illustrated his vision of CAA as more than a talent agency but as a multifaceted business operating at the intersection of media, entertainment, and corporate strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.

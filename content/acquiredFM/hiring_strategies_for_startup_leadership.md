In the startup world, assembling the right leadership team is crucial for success. Both Peter Gassner, CEO of Viva Systems, and Eric Yuan, CEO of Zoom, shared valuable insights on this topic during the Emergence Capital CEO Summit interview recorded for the Acquired podcast.

## Building a Leadership Team

### Internal Promotions vs. External Hires

Peter Gassner highlighted the importance of promoting internally to maintain team cohesion and morale. He emphasized giving people opportunities to do something they haven't done before, which keeps them motivated and drives them to perform at their best. This approach creates a sense of ownership and encourages team members to grow with the company, thus aligning their career progress with the startup's success. He noted that it's not always about cost efficiency but finding the "right person" who fits the company's vision and culture, even if it means offering competitive compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00">[43:00]</a>. These strategies are akin to some discussed in [[challenges_and_advice_for_company_founders | challenges and advice for company founders]].

### Hiring for Potential and Loyalty

Eric Yuan reflected on Zoom's hiring strategy, where he focused on hiring individuals who showed potential and had a self-motivated, self-learning mentality. He preferred building a team of emerging talents who could grow alongside the company. This approach was successful in the early stages when the business was small and nimble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:44">[44:44]</a>. However, he recognized the drawbacks of this strategy when Zoom rapidly scaled due to increased demand during the pandemic. Yuan admitted that his team wasn't fully prepared for such explosive growth because they lacked certain experienced executives in the mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:04">[45:04]</a>. This reflects on the broader themes of [[transformation_of_the_technology_industry | transformation of the technology industry]] as companies like Zoom adapt to rapid changes.

Importantly, Yuan learned the value of having a balanced team as the company scald. While it’s vital to cultivate homegrown talent, it’s equally important to bring in seasoned leaders who have experience with managing and optimizing growth. This mixed-structure enables the company to adapt and thrive even when scaling rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:46">[45:46]</a>. Such balance is also emphasized in discussions on [[venture_capital_models_and_strategies | venture capital models and strategies]].

### Balancing Experience and Innovation

From the conversation, it becomes evident that startups should focus on a mix of up-and-coming leaders who are invested in the company's ethos and external hires who bring industry expertise and experience from larger organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32">[46:32]</a>. This blend allows startups to maintain their innovative edge while also benefiting from the strategic insights that more seasoned executives bring to the table.

## Conclusion

The hiring strategies shared by Gassner and Yuan illuminate the distinctive balance between promoting internal talent and strategically incorporating external experience. Their insights serve as a guide for startups aiming to build resilient leadership teams that can steer complex growth paths. A strategic approach to hiring can ensure that a startup is not only agile and innovative but also equipped to handle rapid expansion and market challenges.

Meta, formerly known as Facebook, is undergoing a significant transformation in its approach to future technologies, with a keen focus on augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI). Spearheading this shift is CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who envisions these technologies as pivotal to the social connection company's future. Here’s a deep dive into [[mark_zuckerbergs_approach_to_company_strategy | Meta's strategy]] for AR and AI as articulated by Zuckerberg during a live podcast event.

## Vision for Augmented Reality

Meta's exploration into AR is underpinned by a vision to redefine human connection. Zuckerberg imagines a future where social interactions are seamless and immersive, facilitated by technologies that transcend the limitations of current smartphone screens. The goal is to create an experience that doesn’t distract from physical interactions but rather enhances them through sophisticated, virtually augmented realities.

### AR Integration with Glasses

Zuckerberg shared insights into the monumental task of integrating AR into everyday glasses, which could project holograms and enable a realistic sense of presence during remote interactions. This involves substantial miniaturization of technology, requiring advancements in display stacks, eye-tracking, cameras, and more within the glasses.

> “The ultimate Digital social experience is going to be glasses where...one person is physically here, and another is a hologram. The conversation feels natural in shared spaces, leveraging advanced display and AI technologies” – Mark Zuckerberg

## AI as a Cornerstone

On the AI front, Meta is focusing heavily on natural language processing and virtual assistants. These are envisioned as understanding the context of user interactions more deeply than ever before, thanks to AR-enhanced capabilities. The company is leveraging AI to potentially revolutionize interactions with wearable technologies, making them not just tools but companions.

### Meta AI Assistants

The AI strategy is to embed assistants within smart glasses, making them the "perfect AI assistant" by having the contextual knowledge of their wearers’ activities. Such integration is seen as a next step in [[ai_and_machine_learning_advancements | AI evolution]].

> “With glasses being contextually aware of what you see and hear, they can act as an ideal personal assistant. AI occupies a core place in this future vision.” – Mark Zuckerberg

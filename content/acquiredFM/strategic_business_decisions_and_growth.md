Hermès, established in 1837, is an exemplary case of [[history_of_hermes | strategic decisions]] fueling substantial growth over centuries. This article delves into the strategic decisions that have kept Hermès at the pinnacle of the luxury industry, ensuring its enduring success and growth.

## Craftsmanship and Exclusive Production

One of the most noteworthy strategic decisions by Hermès is the meticulous focus on [[craftsmanship_and_production_methods | craftsmanship]]. Every leather goods item, including their iconic Birkin and Kelly bags, is crafted entirely by one artisan. This approach not only preserves the quality and soul of each product but also sets Hermès apart from other luxury brands that opt for mass production methods. Today, Hermès employs around 7,000 artisans who are integral to maintaining the company's legacy of craftsmanship [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:26">2:49:26</a>].

## Expansion and Market Positioning

Hermès's growth is also attributed to strategic international expansion. Historically, they capitalized on burgeoning markets like Asia, particularly China and Japan, which today account for a significant portion of their sales. For instance, the Asia Pacific region represents 48% of current sales, highlighting Hermès's successful positioning in these lucrative markets [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:44">3:12:44</a>].

Initially, Hermès expanded by maintaining ownership of their stores, ensuring control and consistency with the brand's image. They currently own about 74% of their stores worldwide, enhancing their ability to offer a bespoke shopping experience and maintain brand purity [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:36">3:43:36</a>].

## Balancing Tradition with Innovation

Balancing tradition with innovation has been another cornerstone strategy for Hermès. Despite technological advances, Hermès's decision to avoid mass production and maintain a high degree of handcraftsmanship stands out. This adherence to traditional methods is complemented by cautious modern-day innovations, such as their strategic partnership with Apple for the Hermes Apple Watch [[comparisons_and_competition_with_other_tech_companies_like_apple_and_google | strategic partnership with Apple]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">2:57:00</a>]. This collaboration illustrates Hermès's ability to embrace modern technology without compromising its artisanal values.

## Financial Strategy and Market Defense

Financial strategy also played a pivotal role in Hermès's growth. Listing on the Paris Stock Exchange in 1993 provided liquidity while ensuring control remained within the Hermès family [[the_importance_of_governance_structure_and_independence_in_meta | control remained within the Hermès family]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:21">2:08:21</a>]. When faced with a takeover attempt by LVMH, they successfully established a pooled family holding, H51, to safeguard their independence, showcasing strategic foresight and the importance of family unity in maintaining control [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:21">2:35:21</a>].

Below are the key takeaways from their conversation.

## The Economics of Podcasting
Jason Calacanis highlighted the financial dynamics of podcasting, noting that the advertising market is vibrant and growing, unlike traditional blogging, which has seen a decline (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>). The hosts discussed the tension between offering premium content behind paywalls and making it accessible to a larger audience. Ben Gilbert mentioned that "Acquired FM" has shifted to releasing all LP episodes for free after two weeks, allowing great content to reach more people, given that only a small minority paid exclusively for content (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>).

## Challenges of Paywalls
Calacanis expressed his resistance to paywalls, particularly when it involves charging founders, who are the primary audience for "This Week in Startups." He believes that the vibrant advertising market currently justifies keeping content accessible without additional charges (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>).

The hosts discussed how producing podcasts can be an educational journey, akin to ongoing graduate studies. Jason compared podcasting to earning new degrees in diverse subjects, emphasizing that each episode contributes to personal growth and deeper industry knowledge, akin to the [[the_importance_of_storytelling_and_repetition_in_learning | importance of storytelling]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>).

## Trends in Podcast Length and Format
The conversation also touched on podcast formats and lengths. Ben Gilbert shared that "Acquired FM" often produces three-hour episodes, which run counter to conventional wisdom that suggests shorter lengths. However, they found an audience that appreciates comprehensive, deep dives into topics, proving that niche audiences exist for longer formats (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>).

## Media as a Tool for Community Building
Both podcasts utilize community-building elements, such as dedicated Slack channels and live listener interactions, to engage audiences more personally. This approach not only fosters strong community ties but also provides direct feedback mechanisms for the creators, reflecting [[podcast_collaboration_and_community_integration | podcast collaboration and community integration]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>).

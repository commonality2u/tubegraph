Complexity investing, a concept explored in a recent episode of the Acquired podcast, offers a unique approach to understanding and navigating the uncertainties of the market. This investment philosophy, championed by Brenton Johns and John Bathgate from NZS Capital, emphasizes adaptability and resilience over prediction and certainty. This article discusses the foundational principles of complexity investing, its applications, and its implications in today's financial markets.

## Understanding Complexity Theory

Complexity theory underpins the complexity investing approach. As Brenton and John explain, complexity theory posits that the world is comprised of complex adaptive systems that exhibit emergent behavior, meaning the full picture is often unpredictable from the components alone. This unpredictability suggests that traditional predictive investing models may fail to capture the actual dynamics of the market. To delve deeper into this idea, Johns and Bathgate were influenced by books like "The Origin of Wealth" by Eric Beinhocker and involved themselves with the Santa Fe Institute, a renowned research institute dedicated to the study of complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Core Principles of Complexity Investing

### 1. Resilience and Optionality

NZS Capital, the firm led by Johns and Bathgate, segments its investment strategy into two key components: resilience and optionality. Resilient investments are characterized by steady growth and the ability to withstand market fluctuationsâ€”these are the "set it and forget it" stocks, like [[founding_and_early_days_of_microsoft | Microsoft]] and [[the_semiconductor_industrys_evolution_and_tsmcs_role | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. On the other hand, optionality involves investments in companies with high potential upside due to asymmetric outcomes, akin to [[venture_capital_models_and_strategies | venture capital]] approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

### 2. The Importance of Portfolios

The portfolio structure at NZS is akin to a [[investing_and_venture_capital_insights | barbell strategy]], with a focus on a few resilient positions (around 15 names representing over half of the portfolio's capital) and a broader array of optionality positions (around 40 names) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. This approach maximizes potential for upside while maintaining a solid base of steady performers.

## Implications for Investors

### Avoiding Overconfidence

A key takeaway from the complexity investing framework is recognizing the limitations of one's knowledge. Overconfidence and conviction in certain outcomes can lead to poor decision-making. Johns and Bathgate argue that it's more prudent to maximize the probability of favorable outcomes rather than assert certainty about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

### Embracing Non-Predictive Models

Instead of relying on predictive economic models, complexity investing focuses on adaptability. This means investing in companies that are structured to adapt to a wide range of future scenarios, rather than those attempting to predictably navigate a single anticipated path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Value Creation

NZS Capital stresses the importance of long-term value creation over immediate financial gain. This involves leaving consumer surplus on the table to ensure the longevity of business relationships and prevent market disruptions due to aggressive value extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

Complexity investing provides a robust framework in a world where uncertainty is the only certainty. By focusing on resilience, optionality, and systemic adaptability, investors can navigate the unpredictable waters of the market more effectively. As complexity continues to define economic environments, the approach advocated by Johns and Bathgate stands out as a compelling strategy for contemporary and future investors.

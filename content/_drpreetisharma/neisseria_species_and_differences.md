*Neisseria* are a genus of bacteria that are [[identification_of_specific_bacterial_species | identified]] as cocci, meaning they are dot-like or round in shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. A general rule in bacteriology states that all cocci are Gram-positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. However, *Neisseria* is an exception to this rule, being Gram-negative, along with *Moraxella* and *Veillonella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Types of Neisseria

The two main types of *Neisseria* species discussed are:
*   *Neisseria meningitidis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>
*   *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>

## Natural Habitat

Both *Neisseria* species have natural habitats in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>:
*   ***Neisseria meningitidis***: Commonly present in the nasopharynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:36">[01:38:36]</a>.
*   ***Neisseria gonorrhoeae***: Present in the genital region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Differentiation Between *Neisseria meningitidis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*

These two species can be differentiated based on several characteristics:

### Fermentation Ability
*   ***Neisseria meningitidis***: Ferments both maltose and glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This is remembered by *meningitidis* having both 'm' and 'g' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   ***Neisseria gonorrhoeae***: Ferments only glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. It does not ferment maltose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Appearance and Shape
*   ***Neisseria meningitidis***: Appears as lanceolate or lens-shaped under the microscope, resembling the letter 'M' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   ***Neisseria gonorrhoeae***: Is bean-shaped or kidney-shaped, resembling the letter 'G' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

### Capsule Presence
*   ***Neisseria meningitidis***: Possesses a capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   ***Neisseria gonorrhoeae***: Does not have a capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Diseases Caused

*   ***Neisseria meningitidis***: Primarily causes meningitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. It is also famous for causing bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, known as Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   ***Neisseria gonorrhoeae***:
    *   Causes genital infections (Sexually Transmitted Diseases - STDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
    *   In neonates, it can cause ophthalmia neonatorum, acquired during passage through the birth canal if the mother is infected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
    *   Can also cause Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, which is perihepatitis (inflammation and fibrosis around the liver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Culture and Transport Media

*   **Growth Medium**: Both *Neisseria* species can be grown on a charcoal-based medium called Thayer-Martin medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* can also be grown on Modified New York Agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Transport Media**: The transport media for *Neisseria* are Stewart's or Amy's media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Meningococcal Vaccine

The meningococcal vaccine targets *Neisseria meningitidis* and includes types based on capsular polysaccharides: A, C, Y, and W135 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. However, serotype B is *not* used in the vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## General Bacteriology Rules
While *Neisseria* are cocci, they are Gram-negative, which is an exception to the general rule that all cocci are Gram-positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Conversely, most [[gram_negative_bacilli | bacilli]] are Gram-negative, with exceptions like *Mycobacterium*, *Anthrax*, [[characteristics_and_lab_diagnosis_of_clostridium_species | Clostridium]], [[corynebacterium_diphtheriae_characteristics_and_testing | Diphtheria]], *Nocardia*, *Actinomyces*, and *Listeria* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-known virus associated with various conditions, including invasive cancers like cervical cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The mechanism by which HPV causes cancer primarily involves the inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## HPV Types and Associated Conditions
HPV is categorized into two main types:
*   **Low-risk HPVs** Numbers 6 and 11 typically cause warts, also known as condyloma accuminatum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   **High-risk HPVs** Numbers 16 and 18 are responsible for causing squamous cell carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Notably, HPV 16 and 18 were recently highlighted as high-risk types in a May 2025 INI set question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Diagnostic Features: Koilocytes
A key diagnostic feature of HPV infection seen in Pap smears is the presence of koilocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. A koilocyte is characterized by:
*   A "raisenoid" nucleus, which appears shriveled and dried up, similar to a raisin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   A "perinuclear halo," which is a whitish clearing present around the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
The E4 and E5 proteins of HPV are responsible for the formation of the koilocyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Mechanism of Cancer Causation
The malignant transformation caused by high-risk HPV types is primarily mediated by two viral oncoproteins: E6 and E7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **E6 protein** inactivates the P53 gene, which is a crucial tumor suppressor gene, often referred to as the "policeman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **E7 protein** inactivates the Retinoblastoma (RB) gene, another significant tumor suppressor gene, known as the "governor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

By inactivating these [[role_of_hpv_in_pathogenesis_of_neoplasia | tumor suppressor genes]] (P53 and RB), the viral proteins disrupt normal cell cycle control, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## HPV Vaccine
The L1 capsid protein, located on the outermost part of the HPV structure, is utilized for vaccine preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This protein is a key component in preventing HPV infection and related cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

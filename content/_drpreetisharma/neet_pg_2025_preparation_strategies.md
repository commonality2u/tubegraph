The exact date for NEET PG 2025 is currently unknown, and past experiences suggest that official dates can be unpredictable, with postponements occurring frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is therefore crucial not to wait for the final date to be announced, as it might be too close to the exam, leaving insufficient time for preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The best approach is to create a flexible and comfortable [[time_table_for_neet_pg_exam_preparation | plan]] now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Crafting a Preparation Plan

A 65-day plan is suggested as a foundational [[NEET PG 2024 preparation strategy | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This plan is designed to be adaptable for both those who have taken a drop year and interns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Recommended 65-Day Subject Allocation:
This [[time_table_for_neet_pg_exam_preparation | timetable]] balances subjects and includes occasional Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Anatomy:** 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   **Orthopedics:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   **Biochemistry:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
*   **ENT:** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   **Psychiatry:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   **Pathology:** 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   **Microbiology:** 4 days (including GT analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   **Other Short Subjects (Derma, Anesthesia, Radiology):** 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>
*   **PSM:** 5 days (can extend to 6 if needed due to subject difficulty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
*   **Surgery:** 6 days (includes a GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   **OBGY:** 6 days (needs to be extensive for first read) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   **Opthalmology (OFA):** 3 days (due to neuro-ophthalmology complexity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>
*   **Pediatrics:** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
*   **Pharmacology:** 5 days (4 days for subject, 1 day for GT analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   **Physiology:** 2 days (can be done in one day as it integrates with other subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>

### Adjustments for Interns and Working Doctors:
*   Interns should add 2 to 3 extra days for long subjects and 1 extra day for short subjects to the suggested [[time_table_for_neet_pg_exam_preparation | timetable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Working doctors should heavily rely on rapid revision videos, as completing main videos is nearly impossible if not studying for 12 hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Main videos can be referred to only for topics that are not understood from rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   The [[time_table_for_neet_pg_exam_preparation | timetable]] needs to be customized based on individual work schedules and available time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## Key Elements of the [[medical_exam_preparation_strategies | Study Strategy]]

### Daily MCQs
Dedicate 1 hour every morning to solving MCQs using a custom module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Initially, focus on subjects that have already been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. As more subjects are covered, expand the custom module to include all completed topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Integrating Medicine Daily
Instead of trying to finish Medicine in one stretch (which is "endless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>), incorporate 1 to 1.5 hours of Medicine study every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This approach makes the subject less overwhelming and allows for continuous exposure, similar to daily clinical postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. It requires significant discipline to maintain a fixed time for Medicine daily, for example, 10 PM every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### Creating a "Volatile Topics" Notebook (20th Notebook)
As you study, highlight volatile topics or areas you frequently forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. Compile these into a separate notebook, known as the "20th notebook" or "chilly copy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** This notebook should only list the names of topics, not full text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Its purpose is to serve as a quick reference for revision in the last 10-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Personalization:** It is crucial to make your own "20th notebook" because what you forget is unique to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Relying on someone else's notebook will not be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Content:** Include volatile topics and mistakes made in Grand Tests (GT mistakes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Subject-Wise Approach (System-wise vs. Subject-wise)
*   **For Freshers/First-timers:** It is recommended to study subject-wise for your first revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. A system-wise approach can lead to missing out on general concepts from subjects like General Pathology, General Microbiology, or General Pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **For Repeaters/Those with Prior Syllabus Completion:** If this is your second, third, or fourth revision, and you have already completed the entire syllabus, a system-wise approach can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Utilizing Resources

### Rapid Revision vs. Main Videos
*   **For Pathology & Microbiology:** Rapid Revision (RR) videos are highly recommended (approx. 20 hours for Pathology, 15 hours for [[microbiology_test_preparation_strategies | Microbiology]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. They condense extensive main video content into tables and key points, making it faster and more consolidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
    *   If you've previously used RR 5.0, stick to it and check the PDF for added topics in RR 6.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    *   If you've never viewed the videos, go directly for RR 6.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **General Advice:**
    *   Start with rapid revision if you are new to a subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. If you get stuck on a topic, pause the rapid revision video and refer to the corresponding main video for that specific topic, then return to rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.
    *   Once you've watched videos to understand a topic, passive learning from videos should be replaced by active recall from your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Re-watching videos repeatedly for topics already understood can lead to overconfidence without true knowledge retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### Question Banks (QBank)
*   If you have completed one round of revision, you can use the RR QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   If this is your first time, aim to complete the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   [[Utilizing and integrating different resources for NEET PG | Don't switch platforms for notes and videos]], but for custom modules, you can use multiple apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

### Frequency and Purpose
*   Three GTs in 65 days is a good starting point for students not yet comfortable with their syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   If you are comfortable with your syllabus, aim for one GT every 15 days or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   The purpose of a GT is to guide your study direction, not just to get a score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. It helps identify weaker subjects and areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   GTs are about time management, analysis of weaker subjects, and memory recall, not just scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

### Analysis of GTs
*   Analyze your GT on the same day you take it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   **Subject-wise analysis:** Identify which subjects have the most incorrect answers, and whether they were factual or clinical errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   **Prioritize:** Strengthen weaker subjects first. If first/second year subjects are weak, focus on them as they contain factual questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **Layered Analysis:**
    1.  Analyze incorrect answers first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
    2.  Then, analyze questions where you were confused between options and made an educated guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.
    3.  Finally, quickly scan through explanations for correct answers to reinforce knowledge, but don't spend too much time on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   **Troubleshooting Low GT Scores:**
    *   **Problem with notes/revision:** If you're getting pathology questions wrong despite watching videos, it means your revision is not up to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>, or the notes are too bulky for effective recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
    *   **Problem with practice:** If your notes are good but scores are low, you might not be practicing enough MCQs or managing them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. Increase the number of questions solved daily and practice with a timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.

### Overcoming the Fear of GTs
*   **Face the Fear:** The only way to overcome the fear of GTs is by taking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
*   **Reframing:** Instead of labeling it a "Grand Test" (which can induce anxiety), call it a "custom module practice question module" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.
*   **Start Small:** If the idea of a full GT is overwhelming, start with mixed-bag custom modules of 50 questions for several weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. Once comfortable, then attempt a full GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
*   **Privacy:** Keep your GT scores private; share only the analysis with trusted mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. The score is a byproduct; the analysis is what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## Specific Subject Advice

*   **Pathology & [[microbiology_test_preparation_strategies | Microbiology]]:** Focus on rapid revision videos, as they cover the content effectively in a consolidated manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Anatomy:** Can be overwhelming. To make it easier, study it alongside allied subjects like Orthopedics, Surgery, and Radiology. These subjects will repeatedly reinforce anatomical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Physiology:** It's recommended to study Physiology towards the end, as it connects with many other subjects (like Pathology and Medicine), making it easier to cover after understanding related concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Difficult Subjects (Ophthalmology, Pharmacology, Biochemistry):** For subjects you find particularly challenging or hard to memorize, dive deep into MCQs after initial revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. Active recall techniques, such as covering notes and self-testing, are effective for memorizing factual subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

## Mindset and Discipline

> [!WARNING] Discipline is Key
> Making a [[time_table_for_neet_pg_exam_preparation | timetable]] is easy; following it is the toughest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Consistent adherence to the plan is crucial for reaping benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

*   **Avoid Mental Exhaustion:** Since there's no fixed deadline, avoid pushing yourself to mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Allocate specific "time boxes" for studies, internship, social media, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Health:** Physical and mental health are paramount. An exam can be retaken, but health cannot be recovered easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Simplicity:** Stick to a simple [[medical_exam_preparation_strategies | strategy]] based on notes and question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Do not complicate your preparation by constantly switching resources or looking for "out-of-the-box" strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear Mistakes:** Finish your "failing quota" in practice tests so you don't fail in the actual NEET PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. Mistakes in GTs are opportunities for learning and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

## Protozoan Infections

### Balantidium coli
*   **Characteristics**: Balantidium coli is a ciliated protozoan and is noted as the largest protozoan found in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Infection Site**: It inhabits the large intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Morphology**: Both its cyst and trophozoite forms are binucleate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. The macronucleus is distinctively bean-shaped, while the micronucleus appears as a small dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Due to the presence of cilia, it exhibits a rotatory motility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Infective Stage**: The cyst is the infective stage, capable of surviving well in the environment due to its resistant wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Pathology**: It causes diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Reservoir & Treatment**: Pigs are a known reservoir for Balantidium coli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Treatment typically involves Doxycycline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

### Entamoeba Histolytica vs. Entamoeba Coli
The differentiation between these two amoebas is crucial for diagnosis and treatment, as Entamoeba histolytica requires treatment while Entamoeba coli can be a normal finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Motility**:
    *   Entamoeba histolytica: Shows brisk, unidirectional motility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
    *   Entamoeba coli: Exhibits sluggish, multidirectional motility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Nucleus**:
    *   Entamoeba histolytica: Characterized by a central karyosome and fine peripheral chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
    *   Entamoeba coli: Has an eccentric karyosome and coarse peripheral chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Erythrophagocytosis**:
    *   Entamoeba histolytica: Ingests red blood cells (erythrophagocytosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
    *   Entamoeba coli: Does not ingest red blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Cyst Nuclei**:
    *   Entamoeba histolytica cyst: Typically has 1-4 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
    *   Entamoeba coli cyst: Can have 1-8 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Chromatoid Body**:
    *   Entamoeba histolytica: Possesses rod-shaped, thick chromatoid bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
    *   Entamoeba coli: Has thin, splintered chromatoid bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
    *   Chromatoid bodies are composed of ribonucleoproteins (RNP) and are stained by Iron Haematoxylin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Pathology**:
    *   Entamoeba histolytica: Causes flask-shaped ulcers in the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a> and liver abscesses with an "anchovy sauce" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

### Amoebic Meningoencephalitis
*   **Naegleria fowleri**:
    *   Causes Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
    *   Transmission: Occurs when contaminated water (e.g., drain water from swimming or diving) enters through the nose, traverses the cribriform plate, and reaches the brain via the neural root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Acanthamoeba vs. Balamuthia mandrillaris**:
    *   Both can cause Granulomatous Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (GAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
    *   **Acanthamoeba**: Primarily affects immunocompromised patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Its trophozoites have spikes, and its cysts have wrinkled walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. It is also known to cause keratitis and corneal ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
    *   **Balamuthia mandrillaris**: Can infect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Its trophozoites are described as "fish-shaped," and its cysts are smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Unlike Acanthamoeba, it does not cause keratitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

### Giardia lamblia
*   **Immunoglobulin Association**: [[identification_and_significance_of_various_parasitic_eggs | IgA]] is the associated immunoglobulin, functioning as a mucosal antibody and a first line of defense in the GI and respiratory tracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

*   **Trophozoite Morphology & Motility**: The trophozoite has two nuclei (like "two eyes") and eight flagella (four pairs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. It is often referred to as the "angry old man" (front view) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a> and exhibits "falling leaf motility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Cyst Morphology**: The cyst typically contains four nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Pathology**: Giardia lamblia infection can lead to malabsorption and villous atrophy in the duodenum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

### Other Trematodes and their Hosts
*   **General Hosts**: For most trematodes (except Fasciola hepatica sometimes), the definitive host is human, and the first intermediate host is a snail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

Transmitted by black flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

### Conclusion for Parasitology
Mastering [[parasitology_concepts_and_quizzes | parasitology]] requires not only reviewing rapid revision videos but also extensive practice with Q-bank questions, as some questions may present minor twists or require careful attention to detail for correct identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. While core concepts cover about 85% of the content, the remaining 15% often comes from practical application and specific details encountered in questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

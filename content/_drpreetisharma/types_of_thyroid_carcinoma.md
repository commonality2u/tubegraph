Thyroid cancers arise from either follicular cells or parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid (PTC)
Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid is the most common type of thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>. It has the best prognosis, with 100% survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. PTC can occur due to radiation exposure, and it is the most common thyroid cancer associated with radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. It can also follow Hashimoto's thyroiditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Histopathological Features
*   **Papillae**: PTC characteristically shows finger-like projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. These are "true papillae" because they contain a fibrovascular core with blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>.
*   **Orphan Annie Eye Nuclei**: Nuclei appear white or "optically clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. This is an artifact due to formalin fixation and is seen on biopsy, but not on FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
*   **Psammoma Bodies**: These are concentric blue-colored calcium deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.
*   **Intranuclear Cytoplasmic Inclusions (INCI)**: Also known as "inky," these appear as pink dots within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>.
*   **Intranuclear Grooves**: These are linear invaginations within the nucleus, resembling a "coffee bean appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>.
*   **Chewing Gum Colloid**: On FNAC, the colloid may appear stretched out like chewing gum due to its viscosity and the thin needle used for aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>.

### Genetic Alterations
The most common genetic alteration is the BRAF V600E mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:50">[01:59:50]</a>. Another common fusion is the RET/PTC fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:53">[01:59:53]</a>. It is important to distinguish RET mutation (associated with medullary thyroid cancer) from RET/PTC fusion (associated with papillary carcinoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>.

## Follicular Carcinoma Thyroid
Follicular carcinoma is characterized by RAS mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. Other mutations include PTEN, PI3K, and PAX8/PPARÎ³ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>.

## Medullary Thyroid Cancer
Medullary thyroid cancer arises from parafollicular C cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Tumor Marker**: The primary tumor marker is calcitonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:51">[02:14:51]</a>.
*   **Amyloid Deposits**: Histologically, it shows amyloid deposits, which appear as pink material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. These deposits stain positive with Congo Red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a> and show green birefringence under polarizing microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:59">[02:29:59]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alteration**: It is associated with the RET gene mutation (specifically on chromosome 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This mutation is part of the MEN (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia) syndromes, particularly MEN 2A and 2B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:31">[02:33:31]</a>.

## Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer
Anaplastic thyroid cancer has the worst prognosis among thyroid cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Other Thyroid Conditions

### Non-Toxic Goiter
This presents as a symmetrically enlarged thyroid gland without symptoms of hyper- or hypo-thyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Follicular Adenoma
A benign tumor that typically presents as a localized nodule, not a diffuse enlargement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Graves' Disease
Graves' disease is a cause of hyperthyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Pathogenesis**: It is caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) (formerly called Long-Acting Thyroid Stimulators or LATS) which bind to and stimulate TSH receptors on thyroid follicular cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Hypersensitivity**: It is classified as a Type II hypersensitivity reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, though some new classifications place it under Type V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Gross Appearance**: The thyroid gland appears "beefy red" due to hyperactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Histopathological Features**:
    *   **Follicular Hyperplasia**: There is an increase in the number of follicular cells due to stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Scalloping of Colloid**: The colloid in the follicles appears "scooped out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Pseudo Papillae**: Small, finger-like projections of hyperplastic follicular cells may be seen, but they are "pseudo papillae" as they lack a true fibrovascular core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### Hashimoto's Thyroiditis
Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a cause of hypothyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Histopathological Features**: It is characterized by dense lymphocytic infiltrates with germinal centers within the thyroid tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Hurthle (Askanazy) Cells**: The thyroid cells undergo metaplasia to form large, eosinophilic Hurthle cells (also known as Askanazy cells), which are a compensatory response to destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Riedel's Thyroiditis
This condition is characterized by extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland, making it very hard on palpation, which can mimic cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Thyroid FNAC Adequacy
For a thyroid FNAC to be considered adequate, there should be at least six follicles, with each follicle containing at least 10 cells (Rule of 6-10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
Exceptions to this rule, where a report can still be given despite not meeting the criteria, include:
1.  Presence of malignancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
2.  Colloid goiter (excess watery colloid prevents cellularity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
3.  Inflammation, such as in Hashimoto's thyroiditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

This system for reporting thyroid FNAC findings is known as the Bethesda system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

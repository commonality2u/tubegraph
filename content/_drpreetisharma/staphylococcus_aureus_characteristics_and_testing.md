*Staphylococcus aureus* (Staph aureus) is a significant bacterium in the field of bacteriology, known for causing a wide range of infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## General Characteristics
*Staphylococcus aureus* is classified as a [[characteristics_of_grampositive_and_gramnegative_cocci | Gram-positive coccus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Unlike most [[characteristics_of_grampositive_and_gramnegative_cocci | cocci]] that are Gram-positive, *Neisseria*, *Moraxella*, and *Veillonella* are Gram-negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The term "Staphylococcus" refers to its arrangement as "bunch of grapes," while "aureus" signifies the golden color of its colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, produced by a golden pigment called staphyloxanthin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

## Virulence Factors and Toxins
*Staphylococcus aureus* produces several virulence factors and toxins that contribute to its pathogenicity:

*   **Protein A** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    *   **Location**: Found in the cell wall of *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   **Properties**: Exhibits anti-phagocytic and anti-complementary properties, protecting the bacterium from the host immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. It is also utilized in the co-agglutination test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

*   **Hemolysins** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>
    *   *Staphylococcus aureus* produces alpha, beta, gamma, and delta hemolysins, which break down blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   **Synergy Hymenotropic Toxin**: The Panton-Valentine (PV) toxin and gamma hemolysin work synergistically to form this toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

*   **Exfoliative Toxin (Epidermolytic Toxin)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
    *   Causes exfoliation of the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Responsible for conditions like Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS) and Toxic Epidermolytic Necrosis (TEN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

*   **Enterotoxin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>
    *   Causes food poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   **Incubation Period**: Typically less than six hours, often 1-6 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   **Differentiation**: If food poisoning occurs within six hours, consider *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Bacillus cereus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. *Staphylococcus aureus* is more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
        *   Dairy and poultry consumption is associated with *Staphylococcus aureus* food poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
        *   Chinese fried rice or Chinese food is associated with *Bacillus cereus* food poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   **Enterotoxin F**: Unlike other enterotoxins, Enterotoxin F (also known as Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin, TSST) causes Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) and acts as a superantigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Enzymes and [[microbiological_tests_and_culture_media | Tests]]
*Staphylococcus aureus* produces several enzymes used in [[identification_of_bacterial_species | identification]]:
*   **Thermonuclease (DNase)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>
*   **Phosphatase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>
*   **Catalase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>
    *   *Staphylococcus aureus* is catalase-positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
    *   **Test Principle**: The enzyme catalase breaks down hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) into water and oxygen. The release of oxygen produces bubbles, indicating a positive test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   **Catalase-Positive Organisms**: Include *Staphylococcus*, *Pseudomonas*, *Aspergillus*, *Candida*, *Enterobacter*, and *Mycobacterium* ("cats need space and space is being made") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
    *   **Catalase-Negative Organisms**: *Streptococcus* is catalase-negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   **Coagulase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>
    *   *Staphylococcus aureus* is coagulase-positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   **Test Types**:
        *   **Slide Coagulase Test (Bound Coagulase)**: Performed on a slide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
        *   **Test Tube Coagulase Test (Free Coagulase)**: Performed in a test tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
    *   **Differentiation**:
        *   *Staphylococcus aureus*, *S. intermedius*, and *S. hyicus* are positive for both slide and tube coagulase tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
        *   *Staphylococcus lugdunensis* is positive only for the bound (slide) coagulase test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
        *   *Staphylococcus schleiferi* is positive only for the free (tube) coagulase test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## [[Culture media for microbiology | Culture Characteristics]]
*   **Gram Stain**: Shows [[characteristics_of_grampositive_and_gramnegative_cocci | Gram-positive cocci]] arranged in "bunch of grapes" clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Nutrient Agar**: Produces a golden yellow pigment due to staphyloxanthin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.
*   **Blood Agar**: Shows a narrow zone of hemolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. This is distinct from *Streptococcus pyogenes*, which shows a wide zone of hemolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
*   **Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA)**:
    *   **Selective component**: High salt concentration allows only *Staphylococcus* species to grow (selective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
    *   **Differential component**: Contains mannitol and a pH indicator. *Staphylococcus aureus* ferments mannitol, leading to acid production and a yellow color change in the medium (differential) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

## Antibiotic Resistance
*   **Penicillin/Beta-lactam Resistance**: *Staphylococcus aureus* can become resistant to penicillin or beta-lactam antibiotics by producing beta-lactamase, an enzyme encoded by the *bla* gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Methicillin Resistance (MRSA)**: Resistance to methicillin (and other beta-lactams) is conferred by the *mecA* gene, which alters penicillin-binding proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.
*   **Vancomycin Resistance**: Due to ongoing antibiotic misuse, vancomycin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (VRSA) strains have also emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

## Differentiation from Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci (CoNS)
*Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci* (CoNS) are species of *Staphylococcus* that do not produce coagulase, unlike *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. Common CoNS include:
*   ***Staphylococcus epidermidis***: Known for forming biofilms, especially on intravenous (IV) cannulas and prosthetic heart valves, leading to prosthetic valve endocarditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. Biofilms make the bacteria highly resistant to antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.
*   ***Staphylococcus saprophyticus***: Commonly associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

## Granuloma Formation
*Staphylococcus aureus* does not cause granulomatous inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. Granulomas are typically seen in infections like Tuberculosis, Sarcoidosis, and those caused by *Haemophilus ducreyi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

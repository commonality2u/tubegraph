Paper writing is an important aspect of a [[pathology_residency_overview | Pathology residency]] and can contribute significantly to a pathologist's career. Residents are encouraged to engage in paper writing, which includes original articles, case reports, and reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Types of Papers

### Original Articles
Writing [[Original Articles]] requires significant cumulative effort, often spanning years like postgraduate (PG) and senior residency (SShip), totaling around six years for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. During initial PG years, residents might not have sufficient time to write many articles, but senior residency often provides more opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. [[Original Articles]] typically require more research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Case Reports
[[Case Reports]] are generally faster to write than [[Original Articles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. They do not necessarily need to be rare or "one in a million" cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. A series of four to five cases can also be compiled into a case report to offer a new perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Reviews
Review articles are typically undertaken during senior residency because they are extensive, akin to writing a "mini book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The speaker, for example, wrote a review on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, reflecting a personal interest in genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Guidance for Residents

For residents without strong academic activity in their departments, it becomes their responsibility to engage in self-study. This includes:
*   **Reading Robins**: This textbook should be a constant reference for academic discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **Reading Recent Articles**: Aim to read one article per week to stay updated on new immunohistochemical markers, genetic analysis, and other advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. This also helps prepare for Journal Clubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Knowledge in Residency
> Postgraduate residents are often the most knowledgeable pathologists globally because they are consistently in contact with textbooks. After residency, practicing pathologists may not have the same amount of time to read comprehensive textbooks like Robins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.

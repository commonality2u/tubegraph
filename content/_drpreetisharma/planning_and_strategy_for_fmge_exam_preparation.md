Dr. Preeti Sharma provides a concise plan and strategy for the upcoming [[FMGE December 2023 exam preparation strategy | December 2024 FMGE exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This guidance is applicable to all students, whether attempting the exam for the first time or those who did not achieve a score of 150 in the June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The primary focus is on addressing concerns regarding a proper [[timetable for FMGE preparation | timetable]] and [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategy | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Overview of the Plan

The current plan outlines a 60-day timetable, commencing July 24th and concluding September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Following this initial 60-day period, a dedicated [[revision_plan_for_FMGE_exam | revision plan]] will be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The proposed [[revision_plan_for_FMGE_exam | revision plan]] is structured into three phases:
*   Revision 1: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Revision 2: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Revision 3: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

This comprehensive approach aims to cover the period roughly until December 15th, with flexibility to adjust once the exact exam date is announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## General Study Principles

For effective [[FMGE exam preparation strategies | FMGE exam preparation]], adhere to these core principles:

### Theory and MCQs
Both theoretical knowledge and practical application through MCQs are essential components of your study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Daily MCQs Practice
*   **Target:** Aim to complete 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Progression:** If you are new to MCQ practice, gradually increase your daily count by 15-20 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Study Hours
Maintain an average of 8 to 10 study hours per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is vital to ensure timely syllabus completion within the 60-day window, making subsequent revisions possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Importance of Revision
Revision is a critical factor in passing the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Success hinges on the number of revisions completed and consistent daily MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Single Source per Subject
It is highly recommended to adhere to a single study source for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Choose notes or faculty that best suit your understanding, even if it means mixing and matching across different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Main Videos vs. [[FMGE rapid revision techniques | Rapid Revision]]
*   **Rapid Revision Videos:** Use for subjects where you consistently score above 80% in your question bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Main Videos:** Refer to these for weaker subjects or topics where your Q bank score is less than 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Specific Recommendation:** For Pathology and Microbiology, it is advised to use only [[FMGE rapid revision techniques | rapid revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   Pathology [[FMGE rapid revision techniques | Rapid Revision]] (PrepLadder): 19 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
    *   Microbiology [[FMGE rapid revision techniques | Rapid Revision]]: 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   Target: Approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, viewable at 1.5x to 1.75x speed (Pathology at 2x, Microbiology at 1.5x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## The 60-Day Timetable (July 24th - September 21st)

The 60-day plan is customized and divided into four blocks of interlinked subjects, considering the current exam pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. While the suggested number of days for each subject should be followed, students can adjust the order of subjects based on their individual strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule: Timeboxing

To effectively manage 8-10 hours of study, 'timeboxing' is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This involves strictly dividing time into study, break, and chill sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

### Sample Daily Schedule (for early birds)
*   **Morning Routine (7:00 AM - 8:00 AM):** Dedicate one hour to personal morning routines, ideally including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM):** 3 hours of focused study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This trains you for the exam's prolonged sitting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Short Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM):** 30 minutes to relax. Avoid social media or screens. Close eyes, listen to music, talk to family/friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM):** 2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM):** 1.5 hours for lunch and relaxation. This is your designated time for power naps, social media, or watching content of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM):** 2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Evening Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM):** 1 hour break. Mix of relaxation and optional social interaction or discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM):** 2 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Nighttime Revision & Chill (9:00 PM - 11:00/11:30 PM):**
    *   **Custom Module MCQs:** Create a custom module of ~30 mixed-bag questions from subjects already completed that day or previous days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This casual review (no writing or bookmarking) helps stay in touch with past subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. It should take about 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
    *   **Chill Time:** Engage in personal leisure activities like social media or watching a web series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Sleep:** Aim for 8 hours of sleep, ensuring you're ready for an early start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Night owls can adjust the schedule by pushing times forward, but maintaining the structured flow is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## Mindset and Motivation

*   **Focus on the Present:** Erase past failures or anxieties about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Your journey starts anew from July 24th, focusing solely on the 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Grit and Determination:** No timetable is effective without your willingness to follow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **"This Two Shall Pass":** Embrace the mantra that challenges are temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The journey may be tough, like passing a kidney stone, but it will end, leading to better days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   **Humility in Tough Times:** Difficult periods can foster humility. Embrace them, as those who do often achieve greater heights in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Long-term Perspective:** Ultimately, clearing the FMGE exam in one or multiple attempts will not matter as much as your clinical skills, ability to treat patients, and humility in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

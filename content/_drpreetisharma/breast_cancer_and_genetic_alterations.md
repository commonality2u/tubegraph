[[breast_pathology | Breast cancer]] is a significant area of study in pathology, with various types, diagnostic methods, and associated genetic alterations.

## Diagnostic and Pathological Features

### Stellate Scars
In breast pathology, a radial scar is observed, which also presents a central stellate scar. This is similar to stellate scars seen in other organs like the kidney (oncocytoma, chromophobe [[renal_cell_carcinoma_and_genetic_alterations | renal cell carcinoma]]), liver (focal nodular hyperplasia, fibrolamellar HCC), and pancreas (serous cystadenocarcinoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Immunohisto Chemistry (IHC)
IHC is a diagnostic tool where brown staining indicates a positive result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>. The brown color in IHC is due to diaminobenzidine (DAB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

### HER2 Gene Amplification
[[her2_gene_amplification_in_breast_cancer | HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer]] (also known as HER2/neu or EGFR2) is a key genetic alteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.
*   **Nomenclature**: HER2 is distinct from EGFR1 (epidermal growth factor receptor 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. EGFR1 mutations are seen in adenocarcinoma of the lung, while HER2 is relevant in [[breast_pathology | breast cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **Targeted Therapy**: For HER2 amplification, a targeted therapy is Trastuzumab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   **Scoring**: HER2 scoring via IHC can be 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.
    *   0 and 1+ indicate a negative result, meaning Trastuzumab is not indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.
    *   3+ indicates a strong positive result, meaning Trastuzumab should be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
    *   2+ is an equivocal result, requiring further investigation with FISH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.

### Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
FISH is used when IHC for HER2 yields a 2+ score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Method**: In FISH, the HER2 gene is often labeled red, and chromosome 17 (where HER2 resides) is labeled green at its centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   **Interpretation**: The ratio of HER2 signals to chromosome 17 signals is calculated. A ratio exceeding 2.2 indicates HER2 amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>. If the ratio is >2.2, Trastuzumab is administered; if <2.2, it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

### Mucinous Carcinoma (Colloid Carcinoma)
Mucinous carcinoma of the breast is characterized by abundant extracellular mucin pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. Tumor cells float within these mucin pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>. While predominantly extracellular, some intracellular mucin may also be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.

### Invasive Lobular Carcinoma
*   **Histology**: Invasive [[lobular_carcinoma_and_ecadherin_gene | lobular carcinoma]] typically shows tumor cells arranged in a single-file pattern, known as the "Indian file pattern," resembling disciplined army men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>.
*   **Signet Ring Cells**: Some cases of invasive [[lobular_carcinoma_and_ecadherin_gene | lobular carcinoma]] can also display signet ring cells, which are characterized by abundant intracellular mucin pushing the nucleus to the periphery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Signet ring cells are also notably seen in Krukenberg tumors of the ovary and gastric cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Laterality/Multicentricity**: Lobular carcinoma has a higher likelihood of being bilateral and multicentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. Pathologists often recommend examining the contralateral breast due to this characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
*   **Chicken Wire Blood Vessels**: On FNAC, mucinous carcinoma may show "chicken wire blood vessels" due to the thick mucin getting entangled in the needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. These are different from the chicken wire blood vessels seen in oligodendroglioma (a brain tumor) on biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.

### Inflammatory Carcinoma
This type of [[breast_pathology | breast cancer]] presents with features resembling an inflammatory disorder of the skin, such as dimpling and "peau d'orange" (orange peel) appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. This is due to dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

## Male Breast Cancer
Male [[breast_pathology | breast cancer]] is much less common than in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.
*   **Common Type**: The most common morphological type in males is invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.
*   **Associated Mutation**: Male [[breast_pathology | breast cancer]] is associated with the BRCA mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

## Molecular Classification of Breast Cancer
The molecular classification of [[breast_pathology | breast cancer]] (applicable to both males and females) is primarily based on gene profiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>, although immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ER, PR, and HER2 is used as a surrogate due to technical constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

### Categories:
*   **Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)**:
    *   Characterized by negative staining for Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), and HER2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>.
    *   Examples include Medullary carcinoma and Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.
*   **HER2-Enriched Breast Cancer**:
    *   Positive for HER2, and negative for ER and PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
    *   Apocrine carcinoma is an example of a HER2-enriched breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.
*   **Luminal A and Luminal B Breast Cancer**:
    *   Both are ER/PR positive and HER2 negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
    *   Differentiated by the Ki67 proliferation index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>:
        *   **Luminal A**: Ki67 < 14% (low proliferative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>. Examples include Tubular carcinoma, Mucinous carcinoma, and low-grade Invasive Lobular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
        *   **Luminal B**: Ki67 > 14% (high proliferative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. High-grade Invasive Lobular carcinoma can fall into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.
        *   Ki67 (also known as MIB-1) is a proliferation marker, with nearly 100% in Burkitt's Lymphoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.
    *   Luminal B can sometimes be "triple positive" (ER+, PR+, HER2+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.

## Other Breast Tumors

### Myofibroblastoma
Myofibroblastoma is a rare breast tumor that has an equal incidence in both males and females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. Its name (MF tumor) reflects its presence in both genders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

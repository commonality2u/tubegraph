From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

Spherocytes are entirely spherical red blood cells observed on a peripheral smear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. When spherocytes are present, the most common underlying cause is [[autoimmune_hepatitis | autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] (AIHA), not hereditary spherocytosis (HS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)
AIHA is considered the most common cause when spherocytes are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation
A patient presenting with spherocytes, such as a 27-year-old primigravida, might have antibodies causing these spherocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Investigation
The primary investigation for AIHA is a Coombs test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS)
HS is considered when there is a strong family history alongside the presence of spherocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation
A typical presentation involves a 16-year-old boy with jaundice and splenomegaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Jaundice indicates blood breakdown, leading to increased bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Splenomegaly suggests the spleen is actively breaking down red blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   A classical family history, such as an elder brother and mother having similar complaints, points to an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Genetic Basis
The most common mutation in HS, which is autosomal dominant, involves the spectrin gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Investigation
*   **Screening Test:** Osmotic fragility testing was traditionally used for screening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Confirmatory Test:** The EMA test (eosin-5-maleimide) is used to confirm hereditary spherocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Differentiating AIHA and HS

| Feature               | Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)          | Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS)                                         |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prevalence**        | Most common cause of spherocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>        | Less common as the primary cause of spherocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> |
| **Key Indicator**     | Spherocytes observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>                   | Spherocytes + Family History <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>              |
| **Clinical Context**  | May involve antibodies, e.g., in primigravida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> | Jaundice and splenomegaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>                                |
| **Inheritance**       | Not typically familial                        | Autosomal dominant (classical family history) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>          |
| **Diagnostic Test**   | Coombs test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>                             | EMA test (confirmatory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, Osmotic fragility (screening) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> |

> [!tip] Approach to Diagnosis
> *   If only a spherocyte image is given, consider AIHA first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
> *   If a family history is provided, consider hereditary spherocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Other Considerations
If neither AIHA nor HS is indicated, G6PD deficiency anemia should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Testing for G6PD deficiency involves measuring G6PD levels in the blood, typically done using an ELISA machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

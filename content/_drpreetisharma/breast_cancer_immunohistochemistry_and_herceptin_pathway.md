Breast cancer diagnosis often involves [[Breast cancer immunohistochemistry and gene amplification | immunohistochemical staining]] to assess the presence and amplification of the Her2/neu gene [00:08:23]. This analysis guides treatment decisions, particularly regarding targeted therapies like Trastuzumab.

## Her2/neu Gene and Amplification

Her2/neu, also known as EGFR2 or ErbB2, is a gene whose amplification leads to increased gene activity [00:08:59]. This [[Breast cancer immunohistochemistry and gene amplification | gene amplification]] is a key mechanism in the development and progression of some breast cancers [00:08:50].

## Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Her2/neu

[[Breast cancer immunohistochemistry and gene amplification | Immunohistochemical staining]] is performed on breast biopsy samples to detect Her2/neu protein overexpression [00:08:21].

*   **Staining Appearance**: IHC staining produces a brown color, which is due to a stain called DAB (diaminobenzidine) [00:08:29].
*   **Interpretation**: A high amount of brown color indicates a positive Her2/neu status [00:08:46].

### Her2/neu IHC Scoring and Further Testing

Pathologists score Her2/neu expression based on IHC staining, which determines the need for further testing and treatment:
*   **0 and 1+**: These scores indicate that there is no Her2/neu amplification [00:09:59].
*   **3+**: This score confirms certain Her2/neu amplification. Patients with a 3+ score can typically be started on Trastuzumab (Herceptin) [00:10:10].
*   **2+**: This is an equivocal situation where it is unclear if Her2/neu is amplified [00:10:17].

### FISH Analysis

For equivocal (2+) IHC results, a Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis is performed to confirm Her2/neu gene amplification [00:10:26].

*   **Principle**: In FISH, the Her2 gene is typically labeled with a red color [00:09:19].
*   **Normal vs. Amplified**:
    *   A normal individual typically shows two red signals, corresponding to the two copies of the Her2 gene on a pair of chromosome 17s [00:09:21].
    *   Multiple red signals indicate Her2 gene amplification [00:09:32].

## Clinical Context: Patient Presentation

A 54-year-old woman presenting with a mass in the right breast that she first palpated 5 days prior, with mammography demonstrating irregular densities in both breasts, often undergoes breast biopsy [00:08:13]. The biopsy showing malignant cells [00:08:21] leads to a mastectomy [00:08:22] and subsequent [[Breast cancer immunohistochemistry and gene amplification | immunohistochemical staining]] for Her2/neu [00:08:25].

## General Approach to Brain Tumor Study
Studying [[brain_tumor_case_study | brain tumors]] should prioritize [[pathology_image_analysis | image-based questions]] over theory, especially for exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>. A quick revision method involves reviewing tables on childhood, adult, and miscellaneous [[brain_tumor_case_study | brain tumors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

## Specific Brain Tumor Types and Their Characteristics

### Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma
This tumor is often seen in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>, presenting as a cystic lesion in the cerebellum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Characterized by the presence of pink Rosenthal fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>.
*   **Genetics**: Associated with the BRAF V600E mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>. More recently, BRAF fusion is considered more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54">[01:08:54]</a>.
*   **Prognosis**: Considered a "great tumor" with an excellent prognosis, often 100% survival after surgical removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

### Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
GBM is often referred to as a "butterfly glioma" due to its imaging appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Exhibits serpentine necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>, indicating areas of necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.
*   **Grade**: It is a grade four tumor, indicating a very poor prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.

### Oligodendroglioma
*   **Histology**: Displays a "fried egg appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. It also features "chicken wire blood vessels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>, which are seen in brain biopsies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. (Note: [[fnac_and_biopsy_correlation | Chicken wire blood vessels]] in the breast, seen on FNAC, are indicative of mucinous carcinoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.

### Meningioma
*   **Imaging**: Characteristically shows a "dural tail sign" in radiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>, as it arises from the meninges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>.
*   **Demographics**: More commonly seen in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Tumor cells exhibit a "whirling appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. Calcium deposits are seen as psammoma bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>.
*   **Receptors**: Often positive for progesterone receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.

## Rosettes in Brain Tumors
Rosettes are a significant [[visual_and_histological_pathology_clues_for_diagnosis | histological clue]] in [[pathology_image_identification | brain tumor identification]].

### Pseudo Rosettes
These are characterized by tumor cells arranged around a central space, which may contain pink material or blood vessels, but lack a true lumen.
*   **Homer Wright Pseudo Rosettes**:
    *   Appearance: Tumor cells arranged in a round pattern around a central area of pink material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>.
    *   Associated Tumors: Medulloblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>, Neuroblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>, Ewing Sarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>, and Retinoblastoma (though Retinoblastoma more commonly shows true rosettes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.
*   **Perivascular Pseudo Rosettes**:
    *   Appearance: Tumor cells arranged around a central blood vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.
    *   Associated Tumor: Ependymoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.

### True Rosettes
*   **Flexner-Wintersteiner Rosettes**:
    *   Appearance: Tumor cells arranged around a clear, distinct central lumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.
    *   Associated Tumor: Primarily seen in Retinoblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>.

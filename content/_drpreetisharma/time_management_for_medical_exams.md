Effective [[Time management for exam studies | time management]] and a disciplined study schedule are crucial for medical students preparing for exams like NEET PG. Given the inherent uncertainties, such as the unpredictable exam date, a flexible yet structured approach is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. It is important not to wait for the exact exam date, as it might be announced too close to the examination, leaving insufficient time for preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Developing a Study Plan
The core of effective [[time_management_for_exam_studies | time management]] lies in creating a workable plan that is adaptable to individual circumstances, such as internship duties or prior preparation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### The 65-Day Study Plan
A proposed 65-day plan balances subjects and integrates occasional Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Flexibility for Interns/Working Doctors**: For those with internships or jobs, it's advised to add 2-3 extra days for longer subjects and one extra day for shorter ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The timetable is customizable based on individual availability and workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision for Working Professionals**: Working doctors should heavily rely on rapid revision videos, as completing main videos might be near impossible if not studying 12 hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Main videos can be referred to for specific confusing topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

### Subject Allocation (Example)
The 65-day plan allocates specific days for each subject during the first reading or revision:
*   Anatomy: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   ENT: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   Pathology: 5 days (using rapid revision of ~20 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
*   Microbiology: 4 days (using rapid revision of ~15 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
*   Short subjects (e.g., Dermatology, Anesthesia, Radiology): 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>
*   PSM: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   OBGY: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   Ophthalmology: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>
*   Pharmacology: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Physiology: 2 days (recommended to study later in the cycle as it integrates with other subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>

### Daily Schedule & Integration
*   **Medicine**: Instead of dedicating a large block, study Medicine for 1 to 1.5 hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This acts as a "clinical posting" and prevents mental exhaustion from covering vast amounts of material in one go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This requires significant discipline to maintain a fixed time for medicine study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Daily MCQs**: Dedicate 1 hour in the morning to solving custom modules of completed subjects (e.g., 50 questions in 50 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. For those who have completed one revision, this can become a mini-Grand Test of 50 questions every morning, rotating between clinicals and first/second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Subject-wise vs. System-wise Study**: For first-time learners or initial revisions, a subject-wise approach is better to ensure comprehensive coverage of general topics (e.g., General Pathology, General Microbiology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. System-wise study is more suitable for second, third, or fourth revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Study Materials and Techniques
*   **Volatile Topics Notebook**: Maintain a separate notebook (e.g., "20th notebook" or "chy copy") listing only the *names* of volatile topics or common GT mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This should be personalized, as what one person forgets differs from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This concise list aids [[revision_strategies_for_medical_exams | quick revision]] in the last 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision vs. Main Videos**: For subjects like Pathology and Microbiology, rapid revision videos (e.g., 20 hours for Pathology, 15 hours for Microbiology) are highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. If you have previously used a rapid revision version, stick to it (e.g., 5.0) rather than switching to a newer version (e.g., 6.0), just check for any additional topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. For those new to the videos, start directly with the latest rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Rapid revision notes should suffice, negating the need to refer to main notes for Path/Micro, unless a concept is completely new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Active vs. Passive Learning**: After an initial viewing of videos for understanding, shift to active recall using your notes and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Repeatedly watching videos can lead to overconfidence without true knowledge retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.
*   **Overlapping Topics**: Some topics, like bone tumors in Pathology, might overlap with Orthopedics or Dermatology (e.g., bullous disorders). It's acceptable to cover them in one subject and skip them in another if they are adequately addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs) and Analysis
GTs are not just about scores but are essential for guidance and identifying weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: Aim for three GTs in 65 days initially if you're not comfortable with the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. If you're comfortable, take one every 15 days, or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Analysis is Key**: Analyze GTs in layers, starting with incorrect answers, then confused answers, and finally, correct answers (scanning explanations quickly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Focus on *why* mistakes were made: factual errors, clinical reasoning, or silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.
*   **Improving Scores**:
    *   If factual questions are missed, strengthen first and second-year subjects (e.g., Microbiology, Pharmacology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.
    *   If clinical questions are missed, practice more from Medicine and Surgery in custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
    *   If recall is an issue, revise notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
    *   If [[focus_and_time_management_techniques | time management]] is an issue, practice solving questions with a timer (e.g., 42-45 seconds per question) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.
*   **Overcoming GT Fear**: Face the fear by giving GTs regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. It's better to fail and learn from mistakes in GTs than in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. Keep GT scores private if it causes anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. If GTs are too intimidating, start with mixed-bag custom modules of 50-200 questions to build confidence before attempting full GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. The name "Grand Test" itself can cause anxiety; consider it a "practice question module" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.

## Maintaining Well-being
*   **[[maintaining_mental_and_physical_health_during_exam_preparation | Health First]]**: Prioritize physical and mental health above all else. An exam is important, but not more than life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Balance**: Avoid becoming a "loner" who isolates themselves completely from social media, family, and friends. Allocate specific time boxes for studies, internships, social media, and family to prevent mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Final Advice
*   **Discipline**: Creating a timetable is easy; adhering to it is the hardest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Simplicity**: Stick to notes and QBank; avoid overcomplicating the strategy with too many sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.
*   **Start Now**: Begin studying immediately, even if it's just decluttering your study space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

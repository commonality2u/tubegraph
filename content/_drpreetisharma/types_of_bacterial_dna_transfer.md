[[Bacterial genetics]] involves the study of how genetic material is transferred between bacteria. There are three primary mechanisms for this transfer: transduction, transformation, and conjugation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. These processes explain how DNA or genetic material is moved from one bacterium to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Transduction

Transduction is the transfer of genetic material from one bacterium to another with the help of a bacteriophage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. A bacteriophage is a DNA virus, typically tadpole-shaped, that acts as the mediator in this transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. [[Bacterial anatomy and physiology | Bacterial DNA]] is always circular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Generalized Transduction
In generalized transduction, the bacteriophage attaches to a donor bacterial cell and injects its DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. The donor bacterium then contains both its own circular host DNA and the bacteriophage DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. As more bacteriophages form within the donor cell, some may mistakenly package segments of the host's DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. These new bacteriophages, now carrying donor DNA, then infect a recipient bacterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. In the recipient cell, the transferred donor DNA can recombine with the recipient's own DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. In this type, the bacteriophage DNA and donor DNA generally remain separate until packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Specialized Transduction
Specialized transduction differs from generalized transduction because the bacteriophage DNA and the donor DNA first combine (fuse) within the donor cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. After combining, they then split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. During this splitting process, the bacteriophage DNA takes a portion of the donor DNA with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. The bacteriophages formed then contain both their own DNA and a segment of the donor's DNA, which they then transfer to a recipient bacterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. The key difference is the initial fusion and subsequent splitting where a piece of the host genome is carried along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

## Transformation

Transformation is a process where a bacterium picks up free DNA from its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. Unlike transduction, no bacteriophage or other bacteria are involved in mediating this transfer; it's simply the absorption of naked DNA from the surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

## Conjugation

Conjugation involves the direct transfer of genetic material from a donor bacterium to a recipient bacterium through a physical connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. This connection is typically formed by a specialized structure called a pilus (plural: pili) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

In conjugation, the donor bacterium is referred to as "male" and possesses a fertility factor (F factor), making it F+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. The recipient bacterium is referred to as "female" and is F- because it initially lacks the fertility factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. The F factor is present on a circular, extra-chromosomal structure called a plasmid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

### Types of Conjugation Scenarios

There are three main scenarios in conjugation:

1.  **F+ to F- Conjugation:**
    *   An F+ (male) bacterium conjugates with an F- (female) bacterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
    *   The F factor from the F+ male duplicates, and a copy is transferred to the F- female <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
    *   After transfer, both the original male and the recipient female become F+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

2.  **Hfr to F- Conjugation:**
    *   An Hfr (High Frequency Recombinant) cell forms when the F factor plasmid integrates into the main bacterial DNA within the donor bacterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.
    *   When an Hfr cell conjugates with an F- female <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>, only a part of the F factor and a part of the host DNA are transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.
    *   Because the entire fertility factor is not transferred, the recipient female remains F- <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>. The Hfr male also remains Hfr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.

3.  **F' to F- Conjugation:**
    *   An F' (F prime) cell is formed when the integrated F factor in an Hfr cell excises (splits up) from the host DNA, but it carries a small part of the chromosomal genes (host DNA) with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.
    *   This F' factor now contains both the fertility factor and some chromosomal genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>.
    *   When an F' male conjugates with an F- female <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>, the F' factor is completely transferred.
    *   As a result, both the original F' male and the recipient female become F' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

### Summary of Conjugation Outcomes
| Donor (Male) | Recipient (Female) | End Result (Both) |
| :------------ | :----------------- | :---------------- |
| F+            | F-                 | F+ F+             |
| Hfr           | F-                 | Hfr F-            |
| F'            | F-                 | F' F'             |

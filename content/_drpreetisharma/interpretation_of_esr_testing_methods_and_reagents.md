The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) can be determined using several methods, each requiring specific anticoagulants and vacutainer types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. While the single best anticoagulant for ESR is tricodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, other options exist depending on the testing approach.

## ESR Testing Methods

ESR testing can be performed manually or using automated machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Manual Methods
Manual ESR testing is performed without machine assistance by a doctor or technician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

*   **Winrobe Tube Method**: If the laboratory performs ESR using a Winrobe tube, blood should be collected in an EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. EDTA vacutainers are typically purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Westergren Pipette Method**: For ESR testing with a Westergren pipette, blood is collected in a light blue vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This vacutainer contains tricodium citrate as the anticoagulant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Automated Methods
Advanced laboratories often utilize automated machines for ESR measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For these machines, blood is collected in a black-colored vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, which also contains tricodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Distinguishing Tricodium Citrate Vacutainers
Both light blue and black vacutainers contain tricodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The distinction between them lies in the technique by which the ESR testing will be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
*   **Light Blue Vacutainer**: Typically used with a Westergren pipette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Black Vacutainer**: Designed for direct use in automated ESR machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Other Common Anticoagulants and Additives

While not specifically for ESR, other anticoagulants and additives are crucial for different blood tests:

*   **Sodium Fluoride and Potassium Oxalate**: These are used in the gray vacutainer for glucose estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. In this case, potassium oxalate acts as the anticoagulant, while sodium fluoride is an additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Heparin**: Found in green-colored vacutainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Heparin is primarily used for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, commonly utilized in anesthesiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

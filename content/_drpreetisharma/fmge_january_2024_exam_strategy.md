From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

As the exam approaches on January 20th, candidates are advised to return to their studies and formulate a strategic timetable to maximize their preparation time. The current period, following festivities like Diwali, offers no "breathing space" for delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Key Questions Answered

### 1. Practicing MCQs alongside Theory
Yes, it is crucial to practice MCQs every day alongside theory given the short timeframe until the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### 2. Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision (RR)
Focus primarily on Rapid Revision (RR) videos. Main videos should only be used to clarify specific concepts that are unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Starting main videos for subjects (70-80 hours per subject) is not feasible with 65 days remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

### 3. Source of Questions
Utilize a Q bank from any platform you already subscribe to, and thoroughly study previous year *topics* (PYTs), not just rote questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. If you prefer textbooks, FMG solutions are an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Previous year questions from NEET PG and AIIMS CET (from the last three years) are also recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.

### 4. How Many Hours of Study Per Day?
Aim for at least 10 to 12 hours of study per day, which translates to 10 effective hours of output after accounting for distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Study Timetable Overview

This timetable is designed for a comprehensive revision leading up to January 20th. Customization is possible if you've already completed certain subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Round 1: First Revision (Mid-November to December 24th)

This round focuses on covering all 19 subjects strategically.

*   **Orthopedics**: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
*   **Biochemistry**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>
*   **Pathology**: 3 days (Nov 20-22), strategically placed before PrepLadder's LRR session for FMGE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>
*   **Psychiatry**: 1 day (after Nov 24 LRR session) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
*   **ENT**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
*   **Dermatology**: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   **PSM (Community Medicine)**: 4 days. While challenging, focus on main topics, as some questions will always be "bouncers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Anesthesia**: (immediately after PSM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>

*   **Surgery**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>
*   **Radiology**: (after Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>
*   **OBG (Obstetrics & Gynecology)**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
*   **Ophthalmology**: 2 days (due to tough topics like neuro-ophthalmology, squint) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>
*   **Pharmacology**: 3 days (kept towards the end for better retention of volatile drugs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.
*   **Pediatrics**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>
*   **Forensic Medicine**: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>
*   **Physiology**: Last 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>

**Medicine**: Do not attempt to study medicine in a 10-day block. Instead, after finishing the first four subjects in Round 1 (around November 23rd), dedicate 1 to 1.5 hours to medicine *every single day* until January 19th (the day before the exam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This approach leverages concepts already covered in subjects like pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

### Round 2 & 3: Revision Cycle (After December 24th)

This phase involves intensive revision and practice.

*   **Short Subjects**: 3 days for all six (Psych, Radio, Ortho, Anesthesia, Forensic, Skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **ENT & Ophthalmology**: 2.5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   **Grand Test (GT)**: 0.5 days allocated for a GT during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **PSM**: 2 days to finish the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **OBGY**: 3 days to start the new year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

*   **Physiology & Pediatrics**: 1 day (using quick notes, RR, and LRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects (Biochemistry, Anatomy, Pharmacology)**: 2 days each, placed closer to the exam (e.g., up to January 13th) for better retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Last Week (Jan 14th - 19th)**: Focus solely on previous year questions and volatile topics identified from LRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Daily Targets for Pathology & Microbiology (After Dec 24th)
After December 24th, focus on 17 subjects, as Pathology and Microbiology will be covered via daily, small targets (30-40 minutes) of important topics provided by the instructor until January 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Important Study Techniques & Mindset

### MCQ Practice
*   **Daily Target**: Aim for 100+ MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Gradual Increase**: If 100 seems daunting, start with 50 and gradually increase by 5-7 questions daily to build speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Integrated Practice**: MCQs should be solved alongside theory as you complete chapters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   **Frequency**: Give a minimum of 5 Grand Tests before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Focus on time management during the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
*   **Analysis**: Analyze *incorrect* questions thoroughly by reading explanations from your app/solution. For correct questions, revisit your notes rather than explanations to reinforce concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.
*   **Score**: Do not obsess over GT scores (e.g., 150+). GTs are often designed to be tougher than the actual exam to push students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. Focus on the learning process and time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

### Dealing with Forgetting
*   Forgetting is a "human tendency" and a normal part of the learning cycle. Accept it and keep re-reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
*   **Effective Revision**: When making notes or reading, highlight only the most critical 5-6 words per page. This makes quick revisions on the last day feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

### Maintaining Health & Well-being
*   **Physical Health**: Dedicate 30-40 minutes daily to physical activity, such as walking. This also aids mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
*   **Mental Health**: Practice deep breathing, ensure a balanced diet, and consider 10-15 minutes of meditation or yoga to manage stress and keep your heart rate normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Aim for at least 6 hours of sleep for proper mental functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

### Lessons from Previous Exams
*   **Image-Based Questions (IBQs)**: Expect a significant number of IBQs (around 65-70 out of 300 questions). These help in quickly identifying answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.
*   **Mixed Bag Questions**: The exam will feature a mix of one-liner and clinical questions. Don't expect only long, complex questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **Unpredictability**: Do not worry about unpredictable elements of the exam (e.g., pattern changes). Focus on what you can control: your preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.

### Mindset and Motivation
*   **Self-Doubt**: Avoid self-deprecating thoughts. Recognize your achievements (e.g., reaching MBBS) and your inherent logical abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
*   **Positivity**: Cultivate a strong positive outlook that acts as a "shield" against negativity from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
*   **Self-Motivation**: External motivation is short-lived. Your dedication to changing your life after January 20th should be your driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. Visualize your success, like giving an interview after passing the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.
*   **Start from Zero**: If you feel overwhelmed or haven't studied, assume you're starting from zero today. It is 100% possible to clear [[fmge_december_2023_preparation_strategy|FMGE December 2023 preparation strategy]] (or January 2024) within 60 days with dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **No Backlogs**: Adhere to the timetable strictly. Do not allow backlogs to accumulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

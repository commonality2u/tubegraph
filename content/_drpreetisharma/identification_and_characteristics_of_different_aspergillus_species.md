The genus *Aspergillus* includes several species that are identified by their macroscopic and microscopic features, as well as specific diagnostic tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.

## Culture Identification

*Aspergillus* species are typically grown on [[Fungal Staining Techniques | Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar]] (SDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. Their macroscopic appearance on culture plates helps in their preliminary identification:
*   ***Aspergillus niger***: Produces black colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. The word "niger" refers to black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.
*   ***Aspergillus fumigatus***: Gives a smoky green color to its colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   ***Aspergillus flavis***: Presents with bright yellow-green colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

## Microscopic Identification

For [[Fungal Staining Techniques | culture morphology]] study, [[Fungal Staining Techniques | lactophenol cotton blue]] stain is commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
*   ***Aspergillus niger***: Retains its black color even under the microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.
*   ***Aspergillus fumigatus***: Under the microscope, its conidia (spores) arise only from the top part of the vesicle, resembling fumes rising upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   ***Aspergillus flavis***: Its conidia originate from all sides of the vesicle, giving it a full, flower-like appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

## Hyphal Characteristics

*Aspergillus* hyphae are characterized by:
*   **Narrow Angle Septate Hyphae**: They exhibit acute-angle branching (less than 90 degrees) and are septate (have divisions within the hyphae) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. This contrasts with *Mucor*, which has perpendicular (90-degree) branching and is aseptate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.
*   *Aspergillus* hyphae are described as very thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. The *Mucor* hyphae are broader and ribbon-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.
*   These hyphae can be visualized as pink under [[Fungal Staining Techniques | PAS stain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

## Diagnostic Tests

*   **Galactomannan Testing**: Primarily used for the diagnosis of *Aspergillus* infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>.
*   **Beta-D-Glucan Testing**: While positive for many fungal organisms, it is generally *negative* for *Aspergillus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. (Note: Transcript states "beta d-glucan can be used for a lot of things... for candida aspergillus histoplasma fusarium dermatophytes pneumocystis gyrovici" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>, but later says it's negative for "BMC" - Blastomyces, Mucor, Crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>, implying it would be positive for Aspergillus, which appears to contradict the previous statement implicitly. However, the last statement before summary is "beta d-glucan is for all except BMC" which suggests it would be positive for *Aspergillus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>). Given the context of the question which asks "beta13d glucan testing is done for", and "aspergillus" is an option, the answer is "all of the above" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>. Therefore, the test *can* be used for *Aspergillus*.

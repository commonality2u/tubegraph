This article details the content and schedule for upcoming quizzes focusing on parasitology and [[general_and_immunopathology | general pathology]], along with other [[pathology_and_microbiology_clinical_mcqs | clinical MCQs]] and [[diagnostics_in_pathology_and_microbiology | diagnostic]] topics.

## Parasitology Quiz
The current class focuses on a parasitology quiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, featuring 15 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This session aims to add extra knowledge beyond [[basic_pathology_and_microbiology_concepts | rapid revision]] materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

Key parasites discussed in the quiz include:
*   **Balantidium coli** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>: A ciliated protozoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, the largest protozoa in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. It inhabits the large intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The cyst is the infective stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Both cysts and trophozoites are binucleated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, with a kidney-shaped macronucleus and a small micronucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. It exhibits rotatory motility due to cilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The primary reservoir is pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, and treatment is doxycycline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Entamoeba histolytica vs. Entamoeba coli** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>:
    *   **Motility**: *E. histolytica* shows rapid, directional motility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a> with finger-shaped pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. *E. coli* has blunt pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
    *   **Nucleus**: *E. histolytica* has a central karyosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a> with evenly distributed peripheral chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. *E. coli* has an eccentric karyosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
    *   **Erythrophagocytosis**: *E. histolytica* trophozoites are seen eating RBCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a> (erythrophagocytosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This is not seen in *E. coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
    *   **Cysts**: *E. histolytica* cysts usually have 1-4 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, while *E. coli* cysts have 1-8 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. The chromatoid bodies in *E. histolytica* are thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, composed of ribonucleoproteins (RNP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a> and stained with Iron Haematoxylin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. *E. coli* has very thin chromatoid bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Naegleria fowleri**: Causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

It can affect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

[[Microbiological tests and culture media | Culture media]] are essential tools in microbiology for growing and identifying microorganisms. The transcript references specific types of [[Culture media for microbiology | culture media]] and their uses.

## General Information
Sessions focusing specifically on [[Culturing methods and culture media for various pathogens | culture media]] are available separately, with links provided in the description [00:00:27]. These sessions cover more in-depth theory [00:00:16].

## Specific Culture Media and Organisms

### Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA)
*   **Purpose:** Commonly used as a sub-route for culturing fungi [01:27:21].
*   **pH:** The pH of SDA is 5.6 [01:27:32].
*   **Exceptions:** Most fungi grow on regular SDA, but *Malassezia furfur* requires olive oil to be added to the medium for growth [01:28:34].

### Chromagar
*   **Purpose:** Used for culturing *Candida albicans*, which forms creamy, pasty, yeasty colonies on this colorful agar [1:40:01].

### NNN Culture Media
*   **Purpose:** Used for culturing *Trypanosoma cruzi* [01:46:05].

### Non-Cultivable Organisms
*   Some organisms, such as *Rhinosporidiosis*, are considered non-cultivable and cannot be grown on standard [[Culture media for microbiology | culture media]] [01:34:06].

### Autoclaving Precautions
When using an autoclave for sterilization, it is important to note certain materials or [[Culture media for microbiology | culture media]] that should not be included:
*   LJ (Lowenstein-Jensen) and LSS [[Culture media for microbiology | culture media]] should not be put in the autoclave [01:25:35].
*   Catgut sutures should also not be autoclaved [01:25:46].

## Other Notes
*   Some bacteria, like *Mycoplasma*, are known for their "fried egg appearance" when cultured [01:29:03].

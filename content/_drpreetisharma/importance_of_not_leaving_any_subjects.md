For students preparing for the FMGE, especially in the last 10 days before the January 20th exam, a critical strategy is to avoid leaving any subjects untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While it's common for students not to have finished all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, the aim is to know a little bit about every subject, rather than becoming a PhD in any single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The goal is to be able to answer at least 50% of questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Strategy for Remaining Subjects

It is advised to make a list of completed and leftover subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The principle of "nothing new" means not delving into rare topics within subjects you've already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, it does not mean leaving any subject entirely unstudied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

For subjects that have been left untouched (e.g., Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensics, Dermatology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>:
*   Focus on **LRR (Last Minute Revision) sessions** (e.g., 3-hour long sessions) or crash courses available on any platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   Do the [[Active recall and effective study methods | previous year questions]] and topics from these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Subject Management for the Last 9-10 Days

A structured approach is recommended to cover all subjects:

### Short Subjects
Dedicate approximately two and a half days to these. This category includes:
*   Head and Neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>
*   Psychiatry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
*   Radiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
*   Orthopedics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
*   Anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
*   Forensics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
*   Skin (Dermatology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>
*   ENT and Ophthalmology (now considered short subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>

For these, review [[Lastminute study strategies | rapid revision notes]] if you are a fast reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, or watch YouTube LRR sessions and complete all [[Active recall and effective study methods | previous year questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Volatile Subjects (Giants)
These subjects are often feared due to their difficulty in retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. There is no individual who can memorize all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Key "giant" subjects include:
*   Anatomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>
*   Biochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>
*   Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>
*   Pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>
*   PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>

For these, revert to basics: LRR sessions and [[Active recall and effective study methods | previous year topics]] are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Even if you haven't studied subjects like pharmacology, watching 4 hours of LRR and solving 150-200 [[Active recall and effective study methods | previous year questions]] can help you score 7-8 out of 15 questions, which is better than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Approach these subjects with a mindset of "survival" â€“ study them once, intending not to study them again after the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.

### Clinical Subjects
Remaining days should be allocated to clinical subjects such as Medicine, Pathology, and Physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Focus on [[Active recall and effective study methods | previous year topics]] and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## Daily Study Division and Mindset

The last 9-10 days require a "scanning machine" approach, quickly going through all studied material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Divide your day into four time slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>:

1.  **Study Pattern (Theory & MCQs)**: This is the core of your day.
    *   Allocate 60% of your study time to MCQs and 40% to theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. When doing MCQs, review explanations to cover theory simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
    *   Aim for a minimum of 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Slowly increase your daily MCQ count by 10-20 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
    *   Focus on [[Active recall and effective study methods | previous year topics]] rather than rote memorizing previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
    *   Maintain 12-14 productive hours of study daily, ensuring full concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. If you can complete targets in fewer hours, that is an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

2.  **Images**: Dedicate one hour daily to reviewing images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. At the end of the day, quickly scan through all images from the subjects studied that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This also makes revision faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.

3.  **Sanity Break**: Allocate 30 minutes for an activity away from books, such as a light walk or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This helps prevent mental exhaustion and keeps life feeling normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

### Maintaining Mental Stability
[[Handling stress and optimizing study routines for NEET PG | Anxiety management]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Positivity**: Surround yourself with positive influences like family, good friends, and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Avoid negative people or rumors about exam difficulty or pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Ensure a minimum of six hours of sleep for proper brain function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Avoid sleepless nights or experimenting with medications before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **Combat Forgetting**: It's normal to feel like you're forgetting subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. Accept that no one can memorize all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. If you forget something, just pick it up and revise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Mindset**: Competitive exams are a mix of knowledge and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Your mental stability in the last 10 days is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. Do not worry about future scenarios like alarms or computer issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Present**: Work in three-hour study blocks with short breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. Do not think about your condition days later, focus on the next three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

## Grand Test (GT) Approach
While it's a personal choice, it is generally advised against giving a grand test in the last 9 days if you anticipate panic from a low score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. However, if you can handle the pressure, use GTs for:
*   [[Time management during exams | Time management]]: Ensure you can finish 300 questions within the given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   Identifying [[Balancing confidence and caution during exams | silly mistakes]]: This helps you learn to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   Do not focus on the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The target should be to clear the exam, not necessarily score 150+ in a practice GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Exam Day Mentality
Remember that one paper in the FMG exam might be tough, and the other might be easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. If paper one is tough, disconnect from it during the break and focus on paper two without carrying over any backlog or hangover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. The overall balance between both papers will help you cross the 150 mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. The exam will include 20-30 "bouncers" (new/difficult questions) to test your resilience and prevent overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>; do not let these questions determine your confidence or preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. Your score is determined by easy questions, silly mistakes, and [[Time management during exams | time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

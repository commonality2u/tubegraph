For students preparing for the FMG exam, a strategic approach involves dividing subjects into integrated blocks to enhance understanding and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This method helps in [[time_management_and_study_planning_for_exams | planning]] and ensures that related topics are studied together, facilitating a more holistic grasp of the curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Subject Blocks Overview

The subjects are divided into four main blocks, designed to be interlaced and aid in integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. While a suggested number of days is provided for each subject, students can customize the order of subjects within blocks based on their strong or weak areas, though the allocated days should generally be adhered to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Block 1: Foundational Clinical Sciences

This block begins with Anatomy, serving as a fundamental starting point in the medical field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Anatomy**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>
*   **Surgery**: 6 days (integrated with Anatomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   **Orthopedics**: 2 days (integrated with Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   **Radiology**: 2 days (wraps up after Surgery and Orthopedics due to extensive use of X-rays, CT scans, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>

### Block 2: Basic Sciences and Core Medicine

This block focuses on basic sciences that are crucial for a strong understanding of Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Pathology**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   **Microbiology**: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   **Pharmacology**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
    *   *Rationale*: Completing these "torturous" basic sciences first provides a strong foundation, making Medicine "certainly an easier boat to sail on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Medicine**: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   **Pediatrics**: 2 days (due to disease overlap with Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   **Physiology**: 1 day (many aspects like neurophysiology and cardiophysiology are already covered within Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
*   **Dermatology**: 1 day (correlates significantly with Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

### Block 3: Surgical and Anesthesia

This block combines OBGY with Anesthesia, after other surgical branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **OBGY**: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   **Anesthesia**: 2 days (wraps up after surgical branches like OBGY, Surgery, and Orthopedics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>

### Block 4: Standalone Subjects

These subjects are generally not interlaced with others and have their own distinct sets of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine)**: 5 days (an increase from the usual 4 days due to tougher questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
*   **Biochemistry**: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   **ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat)**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   **Ophthalmology**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
*   **FMT (Forensic Medicine & Toxicology)**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   **Psychiatry**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

## Implementation of the Block-Based Plan

This entire plan covers approximately 58 study days, with an additional 2 days allocated for Grand Tests (GTs) and their reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. A first GT is recommended after completing 15 subjects, around September 8th, followed by a second GT on September 21st, marking the end of this 60-day timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This schedule emphasizes a focus on the immediate 60-day plan, encouraging students to avoid dwelling on past failures or future anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

For subjects like Pathology and Microbiology, focusing on rapid revision videos is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. For instance, PrepLadder's rapid revision for Pathology is 19 hours, and Microbiology is 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. By aiming for about 5 hours of video lectures daily, potentially at faster speeds (1.5x to 2x), the syllabus can be finished efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

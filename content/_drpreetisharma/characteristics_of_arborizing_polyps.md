An arborizing polyp is a distinctive type of polyp observed in intestinal biopsies, characterized by a unique branching pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

## Histopathological Features

Histologically, an arborizing polyp can be identified by the presence of round epithelial glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a> that are split by a pinkish, tree-like branching structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. This structure, which resembles "branches of a tree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>, is composed of muscle tissue that goes in between and splits the glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. It is sometimes referred to as a "Christmas tree polyp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>, highlighting its characteristic appearance.

## Association with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome

Arborizing polyps are a type of hamartomatous polyp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a> and are characteristically associated with [[Peutz Jeghers syndrome and its features | Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation of Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome
Patients with [[Peutz Jeghers syndrome and its features | Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]] typically present with both mucosal and cutaneous pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. The median age of presentation for this condition is around 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

### Genetic Basis
[[Peutz Jeghers syndrome and its features | Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]] follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. It is linked to mutations in the *STK11* gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>, also known as *LKB1* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. Specifically, it involves a loss of function of the *LKB1* gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>, rather than a gain of function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.

### Affected Sites
The most commonly affected site for these polyps is the jejunum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

### Complications
A very common complication in patients with these polyps is intussusception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

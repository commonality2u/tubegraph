## Infectious Mononucleosis Overview
Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever or the "kissing disease," is caused by the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), referred to as Stein Barr Virus in the transcript [02:01:36], [02:01:38], [02:01:43]. This condition can lead to a variety of non-specific symptoms, making diagnosis challenging [02:01:56].

### Clinical Presentation
Patients with infectious mononucleosis may present with:
*   Enlarged salivary glands ("hay fever glads") [02:01:58]
*   Enlarged tonsils [02:02:02]
*   Enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) [02:02:05]

### Diagnostic Findings
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear**: A characteristic finding is the "ballerina skirt appearance" of lymphocytes, known as Downey cells [02:01:28], [02:01:34], [02:02:22]. These Downey cells are identified as CD8 T lymphocytes [02:02:26], [02:03:09].
*   **Serological Tests**:
    *   Historically, the Paul-Bunnell test was used [02:02:31].
    *   Currently, the Monospot test is the primary diagnostic method [02:02:35]. A positive Monospot test indicates Epstein-Barr Virus infection [02:02:40], [02:02:42].

### Viral Characteristics and Cellular Tropism
The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) primarily enters B cells in human beings [02:02:49], [02:03:04]. The receptor for EBV entry is CR2 (CD21), also referred to as CD2 CR2 [02:02:53], [02:02:56]. While EBV enters B cells, the characteristic Downey cells observed are CD8 T lymphocytes [02:03:09].

This 60-day study timetable is designed for students preparing for the [[fmge_december_2024_exam_preparation | December 2024 FMGE exam]], whether they are first-time test-takers or those who did not achieve a score above 150 in the recent June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The plan aims to be concise and directly address common concerns regarding study schedules and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Timetable Overview
This 60-day timetable runs from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Following its completion, a detailed [[revision_strategy_for_fmge | revision plan]] will be provided, typically structured into three revisions: 45 days, 5 days, and 15 days, aiming to conclude around December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Core Principles
The 60-day plan emphasizes two main components:
*   **Theory** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
*   **MCQs** (Multiple Choice Questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

### Daily Study Goals
*   **MCQs:** Aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If you're new to daily MCQ practice, gradually increase your count by 15-20 per day until you reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Study Hours:** Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is crucial for syllabus completion within 60 days, which in turn enables the subsequent three revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The key to cracking the exam lies in the number of revisions and daily MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Source Selection
*   **Single Source:** Utilize a single, consistent source for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This involves mixing and matching faculty or notes to find what works best for your understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Video Types:**
    *   **Rapid Revision Videos:** Use for subjects where you consistently score above 80% in your Q bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   **Main Videos:** Refer to these for weaker subjects or topics where your Q bank score is less than 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This customization is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   **Specific Recommendations:** For Pathology and Microbiology, it's advised to use rapid revision videos only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For Pathology, the rapid revision is approximately 19 hours, and for Microbiology, it's 16 hours on PrepLadder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This translates to about 5 hours of video lectures per day, which can be watched at 1.5x or 1.75x speed (Pathology can even be watched at 2x, Microbiology at 1.5x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Subject-wise Plan (58 Study Days + 2 Grand Test Days)
The subjects are divided into four interconnected blocks to facilitate integrated learning based on the current exam pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Block 1 (Initial Days: July 24th onwards)
*   **Anatomy:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
*   **Surgery:** 6 days (integrated with Anatomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   **Orthopedics:** 2 days (integrated with Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>

*   **GT 1:** September 8th (after approximately 15 subjects are covered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
*   **GT 2:** September 21st (marks the end of the 60-day timetable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

## Daily Timetable Structure (Time Boxing)
A daily schedule based on "time boxing" helps manage study, break, and chill times effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

*   **Morning Routine (1 hour):** Wake up and enjoy a morning routine, ideally including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM):** 3 hours of focused study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This trains you to sit for long durations, similar to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Break 1 (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM):** 30 minutes. This is a relaxation break, *not* for social media or studying. Close eyes, listen to music, talk to family/friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Avoid screens to prevent eye strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM):** 2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. By lunchtime, you'll have completed 5.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM):** 1.5 hours. This includes lunch (30 minutes) and an hour for relaxation, a power nap, or personal choice activities like social media or watching something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM):** 2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Break 2 (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM):** 1 hour. A mix of short break (20 minutes) and time to talk to friends, discuss studies, or use social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM):** 2 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Night-time (9:00 PM - 11:00/11:30 PM):**
    *   **Custom MCQ Module:** Spend about 30 minutes casually attempting a custom module of 30 mixed-bag questions from subjects already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This helps stay in touch with past subjects without serious note-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
    *   **Chill Time:** Relax, watch social media, or a web series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Sleep:** Aim to sleep by 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM to ensure 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This schedule provides approximately 10 hours of study with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

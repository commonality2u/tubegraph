This article outlines a specific 60-day [[fmge_december_2024_preparation_strategy | plan and strategy]] for students preparing for the upcoming December 2024 FMGE exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is applicable for both first-time test-takers and those who scored below 150 in the June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The 60-day timetable runs from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Following this period, a comprehensive revision plan will be introduced, comprising three revisions: one for 45 days, another for 5 days, and a final one for 15 days, roughly concluding by December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Core Principles for the 60-Day Plan

The 60-day plan emphasizes a balanced approach to [[effective_study_strategies_for_fmge | study]].

*   **Focus Areas**
    *   The two main areas of focus are Theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
    *   Students should aim to complete 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. If you're currently practicing fewer, gradually increase your daily count by 15-20 MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

*   **Study Hours**
    *   An average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is crucial to finish the syllabus within 60 days, enabling subsequent revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

*   **Importance of Revision and Practice**
    *   More than just content, the key to cracking the FMGE exam lies in the number of revisions and the daily practice of MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

*   **Study Material Source**
    *   It is essential to stick to a single source per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Students should combine and match different faculties or notes to find what works best for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

*   **Video Lecture Strategy**
    *   For subjects where you consistently score above 80% in your Q-bank, utilize rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   For weaker subjects or topics where your Q-bank score is less than 80%, refer to main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   Specifically, for Pathology and Microbiology, only rapid revision videos should be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
        *   Rapid Revision Pathology (PrepLadder) is 19 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
        *   Rapid Revision Microbiology is 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
        *   This translates to approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, which can be watched at 1.5x to 1.75x speed (Pathology at 2x, Microbiology at 1.5x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Subject-Wise Study Plan (Four Blocks)

The subjects are divided into four interlinked blocks to facilitate integrated learning and align with the current exam pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

*   **Block 1**
    *   Anatomy: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>
    *   Surgery: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
    *   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
    *   Radiology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

    *   Biochemistry: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
    *   ENT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
    *   Ophthalmology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
    *   Forensic Medicine & Toxicology (FMT): 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
    *   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

### Grand Tests (GTs)

Two Grand Tests (GTs) are incorporated into the 58-day study plan, making it a total of 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>:
*   GT 1: September 8th (after 15 subjects are covered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   GT 2: September 21st (at the end of the 60-day plan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Each GT day is dedicated entirely to giving the test and reviewing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## A Day in Your Life: The Daily Schedule

This [[time_management_and_study_timetable_for_fmge | daily timetable]] is designed to help students achieve 8-10 hours of study while incorporating necessary breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

*   **Morning Routine (1 hour before 8 AM)**
    *   Wake up and enjoy your morning routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   Include 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air, e.g., a walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)**
    *   3 hours of focused study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This trains you to sit for extended periods, similar to the exam duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

*   **Short Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM)**
    *   30-minute break for relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Avoid social media or other screens to rest your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM)**
    *   2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. By lunchtime, you've completed 5.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM)**
    *   1.5 hours for lunch and relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This can include a power nap or social media use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM)**
    *   2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

*   **Evening Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)**
    *   1-hour break, including a mix of physical activity (20 minutes) and social interaction or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM)**
    *   2 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

*   **Nightly MCQ Practice (9:00 PM onwards)**
    *   Before sleeping (by 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM), complete a custom module of 30 mixed-bag questions from all subjects covered until that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
    *   This is a casual, "JY JY" (just for fun) test, not for writing notes or bookmarking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. It should take a maximum of 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
    *   The purpose is to stay in touch with previously studied subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

*   **Wind Down (After MCQ Practice)**
    *   Relax, use social media, or watch a web series (e.g., 20 minutes daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
    *   Aim to be asleep by 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM to ensure 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Mindset for Success

This plan emphasizes living in the present moment, focusing solely on the 60-day plan without dwelling on past scores or future anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The journey will be tough, akin to passing a kidney stone, but nothing remains constant, and better days will come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. This testing time is meant to build resilience and humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. In the long run, clinical skills and humility are what truly matter, not the number of attempts to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

Students are encouraged to customize the timetable to fit their strengths and weaknesses but adhere to the given number of days per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Consistency and vigilance are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

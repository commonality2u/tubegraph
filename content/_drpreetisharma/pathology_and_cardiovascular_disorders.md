## Cardiac Tumors

Cardiac tumors can be primary or secondary, benign or malignant. Secondary metastatic tumors are the most common cardiac malignancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Primary Cardiac Tumors

*   **Adults**:
    *   **Benign**: Myxoma is the most common primary benign cardiac tumor in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
        *   Myxomas typically occur in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
        *   They are most commonly found in the left atrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
        *   Grossly, they appear as a jelly-like mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
        *   Microscopically, they are characterized by "lepidic cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
    *   **Malignant**: Angiosarcoma is the most common primary malignant cardiac tumor in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Children**:
    *   **Benign**: Rhabdomyoma is the most common primary benign cardiac tumor in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
        *   Rhabdomyomas are typically seen in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
        *   They are associated with tuberous sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
        *   Microscopically, rhabdomyomas are characterized by "spider cells" due to glycogen content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, which stain PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
    *   **Malignant**: Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common primary malignant cardiac tumor in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
        *   Rhabdomyosarcomas are positive for desmin and myogenin, with desmin being a better marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   **Cardiac Valve Tumors**: Papillary fibroelastoma is a common cardiac valvular tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. It often resembles a "sea anemone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## Tuberous Sclerosis

Tuberous sclerosis is a syndrome associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
It is an autosomal dominant disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Genetic Basis
*   TSC1 gene (codes for Hamartin) on Chromosome 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
*   TSC2 gene (codes for Tuberin) on Chromosome 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>

### Clinical Manifestations (Mnemonic: ASH LEAF)
*   **A**sh-leaf spots (hypopigmented macules on skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   **S**hae-green patch (leathery, thickened skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
*   **H**eart: Rhabdomyoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>
*   **L**ungs: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> (a tumor with lymphatic channels, blood vessels, and smooth muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>)
*   **E**pilepsy (due to cortical tubers in the brain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
    *   Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) can occur in the CNS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **A**ngiomyolipoma (AML) in the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   **F**ace: Angiofibroma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>

Most of the tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis (rhabdomyoma, LAM, AML) are hamartomatous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Hamartomas are disorganized but benign growths of mature cells indigenous to the site of the lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Cardiomyopathies

### Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)
*   Characterized by dilation of all four cardiac chambers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   Genetic alteration: Most commonly due to mutations in the Titin gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Titin is the largest protein in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   Histopathology: May show a "ninja star appearance" of the nucleus in some cases with Titin mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   Causes: Alcohol is a very common cause of DCM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. In 50% of cases, the reason is unknown (idiopathic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
*   Genetic alteration: Most commonly due to mutations in the Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC) gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.
*   Grossly, it presents as a "banana-shaped heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.
*   Histopathology: Characterized by disarray of cardiac muscle fibers, also known as "helter-skelter" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Absence of myo-fiber disarray rules out HCM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.
*   Often a cause of sudden death in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

### Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
*   Genetic alteration: Associated with mutations in the Plakoglobin gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   Clinical presentation: Characterized by arrhythmias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, right ventricular involvement (fibrofatty replacement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
*   Associated with Naxos syndrome, which includes woolly hair and keratoderma (thick palms and soles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

## Myocardial Infarction (MI)

*   **Type of Necrosis**: MI is characterized by coagulative necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.
*   **Complications Post-MI**:
    *   **Rupture**: Most likely to occur 3-7 days post-MI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, before granulation tissue formation (which begins around day 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
    *   **Dressler's Syndrome**: Autoimmune pericarditis, a late complication occurring 19-21 days (or after 3 weeks) post-MI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. It's an autoimmune reaction where the body produces antibodies against cardiac antigens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
    *   **Reperfusion Injury**: Occurs after restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. It is mediated by:
        *   Free radicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>
        *   Inflammatory cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>
        *   Calcium influx, leading to contraction band necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.
*   **TTC Staining**:
    *   Tetrazolium Chloride (TPTC) stain is used to detect MI within the first 4 hours, when no gross changes are visible to the naked eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
    *   **Principle**: Stains for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), specifically LDH1, which is abundant in normal viable heart tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.
    *   **Normal Viable Heart**: Stains brick red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.
    *   **Infarcted (Dead) Tissue**: Appears pale as LDH is depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

## Cardiac Valve Disorders

### Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Often asymptomatic and an incidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   **Auscultation**: May present with a mid-systolic click and/or a late systolic murmur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.
*   **Other Names**: Floppy valve syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>, Barlow syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
*   **Histopathology**: Characterized by myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, making it loose and floppy, with a jelly-like consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## Other Related Concepts in Pathology

### PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) Stain
*   Spider cells in rhabdomyomas are PAS positive due to glycogen content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

The string test, also known as the Entero-Test, is a diagnostic method primarily used to identify small intestinal infections, particularly those caused by [[Giardia lamblia diagnostic methods and characteristics | *Giardia lamblia*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, a parasite that tends to reside in the duodenum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This method is especially useful when [[Giardia lamblia diagnostic methods and characteristics | *Giardia*]] trophozoites are not visible in a standard stool examination despite the presence of symptoms like persistent watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and dehydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Procedure

The string test involves the patient swallowing a capsule containing a string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The capsule travels down to the duodenum, while the string remains outside the patient's mouth, secured with tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. After a period, the string is pulled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The contents collected on the string from the duodenum are then examined under a microscope to identify the presence of [[Giardia lamblia diagnostic methods and characteristics | *Giardia lamblia*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Distinguishing from Other String Tests

It is important to differentiate the patient-administered string test for [[Giardia lamblia diagnostic methods and characteristics | *Giardia*]] from other "string tests" performed in a microbiology laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Laboratory-based string tests are used for identifying bacteria like *Vibrio cholera* (associated with rice water stools) and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, and involve examining cultures or plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

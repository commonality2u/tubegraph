## Introduction
This article covers key aspects of breast cancer pathology and genetics, including specific types, diagnostic features, and molecular classifications.

## Radial Scar
A radial scar, which includes a central stellate scar, can be seen in the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Other organs that can show a central stellate scar include the kidney (oncocytoma, chromophobe [[Renal cell carcinoma diagnosis and pathology | renal cell carcinoma]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, the liver (focal nodular hyperplasia, fibrolamellar HCC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>, and the pancreas (serous cyst adenocarcinoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu Amplification]]
[[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu amplification]] is a genetic alteration seen in breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. The other names for [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] are `HER1` and `EGFR2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This is distinct from `EGFR1`, which is mutated in adenocarcinoma of the lung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
[[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu amplification]] is a gene amplification event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### Immuno Histo Chemistry (IHC) Scoring
Immuno Histo Chemistry (IHC) is used to assess [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] status and is characterized by a brown stain due to diaminobenzidine (DAB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
The scoring for [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] IHC is as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>:
*   **0 and 1+**: Negative for [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu amplification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   **3+**: Positive for [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu amplification]], indicating that trastuzumab treatment can be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   **2+**: Equivocal; requires further investigation with Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### FISH for [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] Amplification
FISH identifies [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] (red signal) on chromosome 17 (green signal, centromere-specific probe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   In a normal person, there should be 2 red signals (for [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]]) and 2 green signals (for chromosome 17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   Amplification is determined by the ratio of [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] signals to chromosome 17 signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. A ratio greater than 2.2 indicates [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu amplification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## Mucinous Carcinoma Breast
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Often presents as a soft, jelly-like palpable breast mass, which can sometimes be confused with a benign tumor clinically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Characterized by pools of extracellular mucin with floating tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. While predominantly extracellular, mucin can sometimes be intracellular as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology)**: May show "chicken wire" blood vessels due to mucin getting stuck in the needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

## [[Breast Cancer Lobular Carcinoma | Invasive Lobular Carcinoma of the Breast]]
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Typically affects women in the post-menopause age group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Characterized by tumor cells arranged in a single-file line, known as the "Indian file pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Signet Ring Cells**: [[Breast Cancer Lobular Carcinoma | Invasive lobular carcinoma]] can also show signet ring cells, which are cells with only intracellular mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. This is in contrast to mucinous carcinoma, which is predominantly extracellular mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Bilaterality and Multicentricity**: [[Breast Cancer Lobular Carcinoma | Lobular carcinoma]] has a significant chance of being bilateral and multicentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Pathologists often recommend examining the contralateral breast in their reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## Inflammatory Carcinoma of the Breast
*   **Clinical Appearance**: Presents with skin changes like dimpling and "orange peel" appearance (peau d'orange) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Pathology**: This appearance is due to dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

## Male Breast Cancer
*   **Incidence**: Much less common than female breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Associated Mutation**: Most commonly associated with `BRCA` mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Most Common Type**: The most common morphological type is invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   **Equal Incidence Tumor**: Myofibroblastoma is a rare breast tumor that has an equal incidence in both males and females, hence its mnemonic "MF tumor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

## [[Molecular classification in breast cancer | Molecular Classification of Breast Cancer]]
The basis for [[Molecular classification in breast cancer | molecular classification]] of breast cancer is primarily gene profiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Immuno Histo Chemistry (IHC) for ER, PR, and [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] is used as a surrogate due to technical and cost constraints of gene profiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

The main molecular subtypes include:
*   **Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)**:
    *   Defined by negative staining for Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), and [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
    *   Examples include medullary carcinoma of the breast and metaplastic carcinoma of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **[[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2-enriched]]**:
    *   Defined by positive [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] and negative ER/PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
    *   An example is apocrine carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Luminal A**:
    *   Defined by positive ER/PR and negative [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.
    *   Characterized by low proliferation, typically with a Ki-67 index less than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
    *   Examples include tubular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, and low-grade invasive lobular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   **Luminal B**:
    *   Defined by positive ER/PR and negative [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
    *   Characterized by high proliferation, typically with a Ki-67 index greater than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
    *   Can sometimes be "triple positive" (ER+, PR+, [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | HER2 Neu]]+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. High-grade invasive lobular carcinoma can be Luminal B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

## Diagnosis
The gold standard for the diagnosis of any carcinoma, including breast cancer, is a biopsy (incisional or excisional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

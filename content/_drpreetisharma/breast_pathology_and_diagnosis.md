Breast pathology involves the diagnosis and classification of breast diseases, ranging from benign conditions to various types of cancer. Imaging, biopsy, and molecular testing are crucial for accurate diagnosis and guiding treatment strategies.

## Key Features in Breast Pathology

### Stellate Scar
A stellate scar, characterized by a non-enhancing, star-like area on imaging like a CT scan, can be observed in various organs, including the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. In the breast, it is specifically referred to as a radial scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Breast Cancer Types and Characteristics

#### Mucinous Carcinoma
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Often presents as a soft, jelly-like palpable breast mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. This softness can sometimes lead clinicians to initially suspect a benign tumor like fibroadenoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Characterized by abundant extracellular mucin pools with tumor cells floating within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Mucin Location**: Predominantly extracellular, but can also be found intracellularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
*   **FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) Finding**: May show "chicken wire blood vessels," which are blood vessels appearing entangled like wires due to mucin getting stuck in the needle during aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. (Note: Chicken wire blood vessels are also seen in oligodendroglioma in the brain on biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>).

#### Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Commonly affects post-menopausal women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. May present with irregular nodularity and irregular densities on mammography in both breasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Characterized by tumor cells arranged in a single file line, known as the "Indian file pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>.
*   **Signet Ring Cells**: Can show signet ring cells, where mucin is exclusively intracellular, pushing the nucleus to the periphery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.
*   **Behavior**: Notably, ILC has a high propensity for bilaterality and multicentricity, meaning it can occur in both breasts or multiple sites within the same breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>. Pathologists often note this in reports, advising examination of the contralateral breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

#### Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)
*   **Most Common Type**: IDC is the most common histological type of breast cancer in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.
*   **Male Breast Cancer**: While much less common than in females, male breast cancer is often associated with BRCA mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.

#### Inflammatory Carcinoma
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Named for its appearance, this cancer mimics an inflammatory disorder due to skin changes like dimpling and "Peau d'Orange" (orange peel appearance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.
*   **Pathogenesis**: These skin changes occur because of dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

#### Myofibroblastoma
*   **Incidence**: This is a rare breast tumor that shows an equal incidence in both males and females, unlike most breast tumors which are more common in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. Its name, "MF tumor," reflects its occurrence in both genders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

## [[Molecular classification of breast cancer | Molecular Classification of Breast Cancer]]

The [[Molecular classification of breast cancer | molecular classification of breast cancer]] is primarily based on gene profiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>, although immunohistochemistry (IHC) for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2/neu]] is used as a surrogate due to practical constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

### Key Markers
*   **ER (Estrogen Receptor)** and **PR (Progesterone Receptor)**: Nuclear proteins expressed by breast cancer cells, indicating hormone sensitivity.
*   **[[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2/neu]] (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2)**: Also known as EGFR2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. Its amplification or overexpression is a key prognostic and predictive factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.
*   **Ki67**: A proliferation marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>, also known as MIB-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>, used to differentiate between Luminal A and B subtypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.

### Subtypes
1.  **Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)**:
    *   Defined by negative expression of ER, PR, and [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.
    *   Includes Medullary Carcinoma and Metaplastic Carcinoma of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

2.  **[[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]]-Rich Breast Cancer**:
    *   Defined by positive [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]] expression, with negative ER and PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
    *   Example: Apocrine Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.
    *   Targeted therapy includes Trastuzumab (Herceptin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.

3.  **Luminal A Breast Cancer**:
    *   Characterized by positive ER and PR, and negative [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
    *   Shows low proliferation (Ki67 < 14%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.
    *   Examples include Tubular Carcinoma and Mucinous Carcinoma (when low grade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

4.  **Luminal B Breast Cancer**:
    *   Characterized by positive ER and PR, and negative [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]] (similar to Luminal A), but with higher proliferation (Ki67 > 14%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.
    *   Can sometimes be "triple positive" (ER+, PR+, [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]]+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.
    *   Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (high grade) falls into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

## [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2 Testing and Interpretation]]

[[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]] status is determined using [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | immunohistochemistry (IHC)]] and [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.

### [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | Immunohistochemistry (IHC)]]
*   IHC staining for [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]] appears brown due to the Diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.
*   **Scoring**:
    *   **0 and 1+**: Considered [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]]-negative, meaning no amplification and Trastuzumab is not indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.
    *   **3+**: Considered [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]]-positive, indicating amplification, and Trastuzumab is indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.
    *   **2+**: This is an equivocal result; further testing with [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | FISH]] is required to confirm amplification status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.

### [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)]]
*   [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | FISH]] assesses the number of [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]] gene copies (typically red signals) relative to the centromere of chromosome 17 (green signals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   **Interpretation**: An [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | HER2]]/CEP17 ratio greater than 2.2 indicates gene amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.
*   **Decision**: If the [[Breast Cancer Diagnosis and HER2 Testing | FISH]] ratio is >2.2, Trastuzumab is administered; if <2.2, it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

### Genetic Mutations
*   **BRAF V600E Mutation**: While commonly associated with Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid, it's also seen in Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **BRCA Mutation**: Most commonly associated with male breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.
*   **RET Mutation**: Associated with Medullary Thyroid Cancer when it is a direct mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:29">[02:00:29]</a>. However, [[Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid | Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid]] is associated with RET/PTC fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Loss-of-function RET mutations are linked to Hirschsprung disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:31">[02:04:31]</a>.

## General Diagnostics in Pathology
*   **Biopsy**: The gold standard for diagnosing any carcinoma, including breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   **FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology)**: Important for initial assessment, though sometimes definitive diagnosis requires biopsy. For thyroid, FNAC adequacy follows the "Rule of 6-10" (at least 6 follicles with 10 cells per follicle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Exceptions to this rule for reporting include malignancy, colloid goiter, or inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The Bethesda system is used for thyroid FNAC reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Brown Stain in IHC**: The brown color observed in IHC is due to the chromogen Diaminobenzidine (DAB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.

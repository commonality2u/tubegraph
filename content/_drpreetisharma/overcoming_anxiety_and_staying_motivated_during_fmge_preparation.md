For students preparing for the FMGE, especially after previous exam results, feelings of anxiety and demotivation are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. It's crucial to acknowledge these feelings and adopt strategies to overcome them, focusing on the upcoming [[fmge_december_2023_preparation_strategy | December 2023 attempt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Acknowledging and Addressing Anxiety

It's natural to feel anxious or demotivated, potentially rating it a "10" on a scale of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. However, it's important to remember that setbacks are part of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. The failure to clear a previous exam offers an opportunity to sit for the December 2023 exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This perspective should serve as a "ray of hope" and a positive driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

The trauma from previous exam results can hinder getting back on track with studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. Overcoming this trauma and moving forward is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

## Embracing a Positive Mindset

The key is to maintain a positive mindset and study with a smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:34:00">[43:34:00]</a>. It's essential to remember that "it's not over until you win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>. Write down your desired score and purpose for studying, placing it where it's visible daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>. This serves as a constant reminder and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:50:00">[42:50:00]</a>.

Consider the "75-hard challenge" as inspiration, but apply it personally by establishing a baseline and setting achievable goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

## Strategic Preparation for December 2023

With approximately three months available for preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, a well-structured [[time_management_and_study_techniques_for_fmge | time table and strategy]] is vital for effective preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Setting a Baseline with Grand Tests
Before starting a rigorous study plan, it's advised to take a Grand Test (GT) to establish a baseline score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. This initial score, whether it's 100, 150, or lower, acts as a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. The goal is to gradually improve the GT score, aiming for an increase of at least 10 marks in every subsequent GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. This approach avoids unnecessary [[managing_mental_health_during_exam_preparation | mental pressure]] and prevents exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. Identify weak subjects based on GT performance and focus on improving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>.

### Managing Study Hours and Mental Health
Dedicate 12 to 14 hours daily to study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. However, this does not mean sacrificing sleep or social media entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. The goal is to utilize study time efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. The commitment is crucial to clear the December exam and avoid the June 2024 session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

### Effective Learning and Revision
The recommended approach for syllabus completion within 46 days is to focus primarily on rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision First**: For most subjects, start with rapid revision. If concepts are unclear, then refer to the main videos for specific topics (e.g., cardiomyopathy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   **Key Subjects for Main Videos**: For high-yield subjects like OBG and PSM, which account for 40+ questions, it's advisable to watch the main videos if time permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. Pathology and Microbiology rapid revisions are considered 100% sufficient for FMGE and NEET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects**: For volatile subjects like pharmacology, biochemistry, and microbiology, repeated reading of rapid revision notes is essential for memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>.
*   **[[balancing_mcqs_and_theory_in_fmge_preparation | MCQs and Theory]] Concurrently**: It's a "big yes" to solve MCQs side-by-side with theory, ideally topic-wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Avoid saving MCQs for later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.
*   **Daily Medicine Study**: Dedicate one hour daily to Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>. This consistent effort, spread over three months, ensures coverage and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>.
*   **Active vs. Passive Learning**: Class lectures or videos are passive learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:00">[26:39:00]</a>. Active learning, which involves daily revision and self-assessment, is what truly yields marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>. Regularly ask yourself questions, cover answers, and recall information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.
*   **[[revision_techniques_for_fmge_exam | Revision]] Focus**: Once the initial syllabus is complete, revisions should primarily involve notes, not videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:00">[30:14:00]</a>. Videos should only be revisited for forgotten concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>.
*   **Question Bank Strategy**: For questions, FMG Solutions is recommended for textbook-wise previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. However, prioritize clinical question banks (like on Prepladder) because current exams feature lengthy, clinical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. PYQs are important for identifying frequently tested topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.
*   **Number of Questions**: Aim to solve between 100 to 150 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46:00">[36:46:00]</a>. If starting with fewer, gradually increase the number (e.g., 50 questions today, 55 tomorrow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>.
*   **Selective Bookmarking**: During question practice, bookmark only genuinely important questions that you tend to forget, not 60 out of 100 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[30:33:00]</a>.
*   **Time Management for Long Questions**: Practice solving lengthy clinical questions to train for time management and identify buzzwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>. This builds confidence and reduces fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>.

### Choosing Your Study Materials
When selecting a platform or source, solve 5-10 free questions from various platforms to see which feels more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. Don't blindly follow what friends use; choose what suits your learning style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>. If you have already been following a source and have notes ready, do not change your source now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a>. Stick to your existing material and make small additions as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:00">[35:09:00]</a>.

For [[time_management_and_study_schedule_for_fmge | daily targets]] and [[daily_routine_for_effective_fmge_preparation | daily routine]], check relevant telegram groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>.

## The Power of Purpose and Persistence
Every student should write down their purpose for studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56:00">[41:56:00]</a>. This purpose, whether personal, family-related, or driven by a desire for a license, should be a daily reminder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>.

Failures are a natural part of life and will continue to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:06:00">[43:06:00]</a>. The recent exam's increased difficulty and changed pattern were a shock, but this means you've experienced the toughest level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:19:00">[45:19:00]</a>. The upcoming exam will either be similar or easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:39:00">[45:39:00]</a>. Instead of changing sources, focus on repeated revision and solving numerous questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:54:00">[45:54:00]</a>.

Don't let external factors or predictions about the exam's nature cause anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:29:00">[47:29:00]</a>. Focus on what is within your control: studying, revising notes, and solving questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:33:00">[47:33:00]</a>.

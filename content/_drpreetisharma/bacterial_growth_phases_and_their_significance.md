The bacterial growth curve illustrates the changes in the number of bacteria over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. The x-axis represents time and duration, while the y-axis indicates the number of bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. This curve is divided into four distinct phases: the lag phase, log (exponential) phase, stationary phase, and decline phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.

## Lag Phase
The lag phase is represented by a flat line on the growth curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. During this initial phase, bacteria increase in size, gather raw materials, and synthesize a lot of enzymes and metabolites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. They adapt to their new environment and prepare for rapid multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. The maximum size of a bacterium is typically observed at the end of the lag phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>.

## Log Phase (Exponential Phase)
Following the lag phase, the bacterial population enters the log phase, characterized by an exponential rise in the number of bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>. This phase exhibits maximum bacterial activity, with all bacteria actively dividing and living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. Due to the active state of all cells, staining during this phase tends to be very uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.

## Stationary Phase
The stationary phase is identified by a plateau on the growth curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. This plateau occurs because the number of live cells and dead cells becomes equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. As a result, staining in this phase will be non-uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. Key events that happen during the stationary phase include:
*   **Sporulation:** Spore formation occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>.
*   **Toxin Production:** Bacteria produce toxins in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.
*   **Antibiotic Production:** The production of antibiotics by bacteria can also occur during this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.

## Decline Phase
The final phase, the decline phase, shows a dropping line on the growth curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. This occurs when the number of dead bacterial cells exceeds the number of live cells, indicating a decrease in the overall bacterial population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. All bacteria in this phase have essentially died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.

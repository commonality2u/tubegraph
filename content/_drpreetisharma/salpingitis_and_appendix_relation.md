This article explores the relationship between conditions affecting the appendix, particularly acute [[appendicitis_and_appendix_histology | appendicitis]], and inflammation in surrounding organs, such as [[renal_and_genital_pathology | salpingitis]]. It also discusses the incidental finding of *Enterobius vermicularis* in the appendix.

## *Enterobius Vermicularis* (Pinworm) in the Appendix

*Enterobius vermicularis*, also known as pinworm, is an organism that can be found in the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. While it is occasionally responsible for causing [[appendicitis_and_appendix_histology | appendicitis]], it is more commonly an incidental finding during histological examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. The classical symptom associated with *Enterobius* infection is perianal itching or pruritus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

### Histological Identification
When observing *Enterobius vermicularis* in histopathology, a key identifying feature is the presence of two lateral cuticular alae, which are pointed projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. These worms are often seen within the lumen of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. The appendix itself is characterized by a dense lymphoid aggregate in its basic histology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

### Egg Morphology and Diagnosis
*Enterobius* eggs are classically described as plano-convex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Inside the egg, a tadpole larva can often be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

For diagnostic purposes, the cellulose tape method (or tape preparation) is commonly employed to collect and identify *Enterobius* eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. These eggs can appear differently under various staining methodologies:
*   Under ultraviolet light, they present a distinct image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   When stained with a Pap stain, the plano-convex egg and tadpole larva are again visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

These [[diseases_related_to_specific_pathogens_and_their_diagnostic_tests | diagnostic tests]] are crucial for confirming the presence of the parasite.

## Differentiating Acute Appendicitis from Peri-appendicitis

The histological diagnosis of [[appendicitis_and_appendix_histology | acute appendicitis]] is critically dependent on identifying neutrophils (cells of acute inflammation) in the correct layer of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

### Histological Criteria for Acute Appendicitis
For a pathologist to diagnose acute appendicitis from an appendectomy specimen, neutrophils must be seen specifically in the muscularis propria, or muscle layer, of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. If the muscle layer is perforated, it would not be properly visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

### Peri-appendicitis and its Causes
Inflammation found in the serosa (the outermost layer) of the appendix indicates **peri-appendicitis**, not acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Peri-appendicitis signifies that inflammation from a surrounding area has extended onto the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

One very common cause of peri-appendicitis, particularly in females, is [[renal_and_genital_pathology | salpingitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. [[renal_and_genital_pathology | Salpingitis]] refers to inflammation of the fallopian tube. This inflammation can extend to the serosa of the appendix, leading to peri-appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

> [!example] Case Study
> A 17-year-old girl presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and an enlarged appendix on [[diagnostic_imaging_in_appendicitis | imaging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. However, histological examination of the appendectomy specimen showed a dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate primarily in the serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. Despite the symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis, the serosal inflammation indicated peri-appendicitis, leading to a diagnosis of acute [[renal_and_genital_pathology | salpingitis]] as the underlying cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of precise histological localization of inflammation for accurate diagnosis.

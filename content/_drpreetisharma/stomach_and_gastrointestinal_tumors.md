## Gastric Cancer

Gastric cancer, specifically diffuse gastric cancer, is characterized by its infiltration into the stomach wall, leading to a condition known as linitis plastica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Clinically and radiologically, this gives the stomach a "leather bottle" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, where the cancer runs within the wall rather than forming a visible growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

### Pathological Features

*   **Signet Ring Cells:** Pathologically, diffuse gastric cancer is defined by the presence of classical signet ring cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. These cells have a distinctive appearance where the nucleus is pushed to one side by a large intracellular vacuole filled with mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Associated Tumors:** Tumors containing mucin, like the [[Ovarian Tumors and Pathological Features | Krukenberg tumor]] of the ovary, can also exhibit signet ring cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### Genetic Alterations

A common genetic alteration in diffuse gastric cancer is a mutation in the CDH1 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, which encodes for E-cadherin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. E-cadherin acts as a cell adhesion molecule, essentially "glue" holding cells together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. When this gene is mutated and the "glue is gone," it leads to diffuse cancers. These "golu tumors" (a mnemonic for "glue gone" tumors) include:
*   Diffuse gastric cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>
*   Invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>, which is known for its "Indian file pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)

GIST is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a> and intestines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, with a higher prevalence in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

### Characteristics

*   **Cell Type:** GISTs are typically composed of spindle cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **Origin:** They arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>, which are the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Mutations:**
    *   The most common mutation is CD117 (KIT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
    *   Less common mutations include PDGFR (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor) and Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. SDH mutations are particularly associated with pediatric GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **Markers:**
    *   The sensitive marker for GIST is CD117 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
    *   A specific marker is DOG1 (Discovered on GIST1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
    *   CD34 can also be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. CD34 is a marker for endothelial cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, hematopoietic stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>, and solitary fibrous tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

## Gastrointestinal Polyps

### Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome

Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome is characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a> (P for Peutz-Jeghers, P for pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>). The polyps are most commonly found in the jejunum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

*   **Polyp Type:** The polyps are hamartomatous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. A hamartoma is an overgrowth of normal tissue components that are indigenous to the organ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. In the GI tract, this means an increase in GI tissue components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Appearance:** Peutz-Jeghers polyps show a "Christmas tree" or arborizing appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a> due to an increase in smooth muscle bands coming up from the muscularis propria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.
*   **Staining:** If there is confusion between muscle and collagen, Mason's Trichrome stain can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. Muscle stains red, and collagen stains blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

### Hyperplastic Polyps vs. Sessile Serrated Adenomas

Both hyperplastic polyps and sessile serrated adenomas exhibit a serrated or zigzag pattern of crypt architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

*   **Hyperplastic Polyp:** Serrations are only present in the upper part of the crypts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. These polyps are generally considered non-malignant and non-premalignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.
*   **Sessile Serrated Adenoma (SSA):** Serrations are present throughout the full thickness of the crypts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. SSAs are considered premalignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>.

### Whipple's Disease

Whipple's disease is a disorder of the intestines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. It is one of the conditions that stain positive with Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>.

## Liver Disorders

### Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)

[[Primary sclerosing cholangitis and liver pathologies | Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis]] (PSC) is a liver disease characterized by a "beaded" or "pruning" appearance of the bile ducts on imaging (e.g., ERCP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>, reflecting strictures and dilatations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

*   **Microscopic Feature:** Histologically, PSC shows characteristic "onion skin" fibrosis around the bile ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   **Associated Conditions:**
    *   It is more common in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a> and is often associated with P-ANCA antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.
    *   It is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis, which explains symptoms like chronic diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Differential Diagnosis (vs. Primary Biliary Cholangitis - PBC):**
    *   **Age:** PSC is more common in younger individuals (e.g., 30s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>, whereas PBC is more common in older individuals (e.g., 50s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
    *   **Gender:** PBC is more common in females ("amma" mnemonic for AMA antibody) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>, while PSC is more common in males ("papa" mnemonic for P-ANCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
    *   **Antibodies:** PBC is associated with Anti-Mitochondrial Antibodies (AMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>, specifically against the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH-E2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

### Dubin-Johnson Syndrome

Dubin-Johnson Syndrome is a cause of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

*   **Liver Appearance:** It is characterized by a visibly dark-pigmented liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a> due to the accumulation of melanin-like pigment within hepatocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.
*   **Genetic Defect:** It is caused by a defect in the MRP2 transporter protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   **Differential Diagnosis (vs. Rotor Syndrome):** Rotor syndrome also causes conjugated hyperbilirubinemia but does not involve liver pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.

### Autoimmune Hepatitis

Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory liver condition that responds well to corticosteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>. Serology for viral hepatitis and AMA antibodies are typically negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

#### Pathological Features

*   **Inflammation:** Liver biopsy shows infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.
*   **Interface Hepatitis:** Characterized by inflammation (lymphocytes and plasma cells) at the interface between the liver parenchyma and the portal triad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.
*   **Emperipolesis:** A phenomenon where one cell is engulfed by another, larger cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. This is a characteristic feature and often seen in images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>.
*   **Hepatocyte Rosettes:** Liver cells forming rosette-like structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

#### Subtypes and Antibodies

*   **Type 1 Autoimmune Hepatitis:** Associated with:
    *   Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a> (like in SLE)
    *   Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>
    *   Soluble liver antigen (SLA) antibody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a> (also found in Type 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>
*   **Type 2 Autoimmune Hepatitis:** Associated with:
    *   Anti-liver kidney microsome (Anti-LKM) antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>, specifically Anti-LKM2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.
    *   This type can be drug-induced (e.g., by acetaminophen or antibiotics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>. The mnemonic "drugs do, drugs do" refers to Type 2 and Anti-LKM2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
    *   Anti-LKM1 and Anti-LKM3 are associated with Hepatitis C and D, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.

### Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that can lead to liver disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. The accumulated alpha-1 antitrypsin globules are PAS-positive and diastase-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>.

*   **PAS Stain:** Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain gives a pink color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. It stains glycogen pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.
*   **Diastase Digestion:**
    *   If the pink color vanishes after adding diastase enzyme, it indicates the presence of glycogen, which is diastase-sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>.
    *   If the pink color remains, the material is diastase-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>.

### PAS-Positive Materials (Diastase Sensitive vs. Resistant)

*   **PAS Positive and Diastase Sensitive:**
    *   Glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>
    *   [[Cardiac tumors and associated syndromes | Ewing Sarcoma]] (bone tumor containing glycogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>
    *   Dysgerminoma and Seminoma (germ cell tumors containing glycogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>

*   **PAS Positive and Diastase Resistant:**
    *   Alpha-1 Antitrypsin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>
    *   Amyloidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>
    *   Basement membrane of kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>
    *   Thyroid colloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>
    *   [[GIT diseases and liver disorders | Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesion]] in diabetes mellitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>
    *   Fungus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>
    *   ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>
    *   AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) subtypes M3, M6, M7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>
    *   [[GIT diseases and liver disorders | Whipple's Disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>

### Other Liver Tumors

*   **Liver Metastasis:** Abdominal CT may show metastatic cancer evolving in the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. A CT-guided biopsy might reveal neurosecretory granules on electron microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>, which points to a neuroendocrine tumor, such as pheochromocytoma (originating outside the liver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

[[identifying_and_understanding_various_types_of_epithelium_in_ovarian_tumors | Granulosa cell tumor]] is an ovarian tumor with distinct characteristics and diagnostic features.

## Clinical Presentation
[[identifying_and_understanding_various_types_of_epithelium_in_ovarian_tumors | Granulosa cell tumors]] are very commonly observed in post-menopausal women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Clinically, a patient may present with symptoms such as a bulky uterus and post-menopausal bleeding, which are indicative of hyperestrogenism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Genetic Basis
The tumor arises due to a FOX L2 gene mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, which leads to elevated estrogen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Histopathological Features
Under the microscope, several classical features are noted:
*   **Call-Exner Bodies** These are a very classical finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. They consist of tumor cells arranged in a round fashion around pink material in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Grooves (Coffee Bean Appearance)** The tumor cells frequently display nuclear grooves, which give them a characteristic "coffee bean appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This appearance is seen as a line going through the cells when zoomed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. [[identifying_and_understanding_various_types_of_epithelium_in_ovarian_tumors | Brenner tumor]] is another [[identifying_and_understanding_various_types_of_epithelium_in_ovarian_tumors | ovarian tumor]] that can also exhibit a coffee bean appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Immunohistochemistry and Tumor Markers
*   **Inhibin** This is a key tumor marker for [[identifying_and_understanding_various_types_of_epithelium_in_ovarian_tumors | granulosa cell tumor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **CD99** The tumor is also positive for CD99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

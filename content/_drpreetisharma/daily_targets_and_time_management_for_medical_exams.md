This session primarily focuses on strategies for students appearing for NEET PG on March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Daily Targets and Kickstart Morning Sessions

Daily targets for Pathology and Microbiology will be initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. These targets will be delivered via a Google Sheet, listing topics from Rapid Revision videos for Pathology and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Students are advised to stick to their current source for these subjects, focusing on the specified topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

The "Kickstart Morning" sessions are designed to encourage early wake-up (around 7:30-8:00 AM) and facilitate early engagement with studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These sessions will begin after students complete one round of Pathology and Microbiology rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The format will be primarily MCQ-based discussions, saving time and energy compared to re-teaching theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The timing for these sessions can be adjusted based on student preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Study Material: Rapid Revision vs. Main Videos

When deciding between Rapid Revision (RR) and main videos, if you have covered 85-90% of subjects at least once, opt for Rapid Revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, for certain "bulky" and "deadly" subjects that yield many questions, it's advisable to refer to main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Subjects recommended for main video reference include:
*   **Final Year Subjects:** Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, PSM (Public Health & Preventive Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. PSM, in particular, has many "crooked" and atypical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Anatomy:** Especially if you are weak in it, as RR alone might be insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Pharmacology:** If you lack confidence, main videos are recommended to overcome the "scare" of the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

## Previous Year Topics (PYQs) and Question Banks

Previous Year Topics (PYTs) are crucial; do not let anyone tell you otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Many helpful resources exist on Instagram that list PYTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. For NEET PG, aim to cover five years of PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. For I-NICT, three years of PYQs are suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. For FMGE, watching two to two-and-a-half-hour video sessions discussing five years of PYQs is an efficient method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

Simply relying on PYQs for a good rank in NEET PG is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>; they should be combined with Rapid Revision and QBank practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

Regarding Question Banks:
*   For bulky subjects (Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, PSM, Anatomy, Pharmacology), aim to cover the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.
*   For short subjects, the Rapid Revision (RR) QBank is usually sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   Practice 100-150 questions per day, gradually increasing if currently doing fewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   Question practice should be integrated with daily study; there are no separate days allocated for QBank completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

Allocate half a day for grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The three-and-a-half hours for the exam, and the remaining half-day for quick analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Focus on analyzing incorrect answers to understand *why* they were wrong (silly mistake, unknown topic, new concept, lack of time/effort) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Do not spend too much time on explanations for correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Avoid becoming solely "statistics-driven" by focusing on numbers of incorrect questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The real essence of a grand test is to analyze your progress and identify areas for improvement, especially concerning fact-based questions versus conceptual/clinical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Frequency:
*   **Fortnightly (every two weeks):** Recommended if you approach GTs positively, viewing them as a way to identify mistakes and practice [[time_management_during_exams | time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Once in three weeks:** If GTs tend to demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Give a baseline grand test at the beginning of the timetable without self-judgment, focusing only on analyzing incorrect answers before starting the structured study plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## LRR (Last-Minute Revision) Sessions

The main LRR for NEET PG will be conducted in January and February, with an aim to complete it by January to allow ample time for PDF revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. FMG PYQ LRR sessions are also beneficial for NEET PG students as a passive revision method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. LRR is excellent for last-month revision but should not be the sole source of study from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

## Timetable Structure and Strategy

A three-round revision timetable is provided, extending until the NEET PG exam on March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>.

### Round 1 (Till January 10th)

*   **Customization:** The timetable allows for flexibility. For example, if Rapid Revision notes are used for Anatomy, the allotted five days can be reduced to three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.
*   **Medicine Integration:** 1.5-2 hours of Medicine study should be done daily alongside other subjects to facilitate integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:48">[01:54:48]</a>.
*   **"Pending" Days:** These are buffer days for catching up on backlog or taking a grand test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **Subject Allotment Examples:**
    *   Anatomy: 5 days (if main videos used) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>

*   Surgery/OBGY: 3 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### Round 3 (Starts February 8th)

This is the final, intense phase with shorter revision times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>:
*   Medicine: 3 days for final revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   Pharmacology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   PSM: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   Other subjects: 1-2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   Last week focus: Volatile subjects like Anatomy, Biochemistry. Microbiology will be covered in LRR and [[daily_study_targets_and_time_management | daily target]] sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

The timetable accounts for practicalities such as falling unwell, emergencies, anxiety, and backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. It's designed to be comfortable and prevent demotivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Interns' Study Schedule

Interns should follow the same subject sequence in the timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The main change is to add one extra day to each subject's allotted time due to reduced study hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Interns should rely solely on Rapid Revision and QBank, avoiding main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

A key tip for interns is to finish short subjects quickly (Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, Skin) during lighter posting periods, which can provide a confidence boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Daily targets for Pathology and Microbiology can be managed in short bursts (e.g., 40 minutes) even during busy work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## General Advice

*   **Study Output:** 10-11 hours of pure study output per day is excellent and should not be increased to avoid mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Confidence:** Confidence comes from solving questions. Increase daily question practice to build confidence, especially after completing revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Nightmare Subjects:** Confront and address subjects that are a source of fear (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology). Dedicate sufficient time (4-5 days) to their main videos/notes and QBank to overcome the fear, as mindset is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **CBME Pattern:** For NEET PG, stick to the organ-system-wise study method for subjects like Microbiology, rather than the integrated CBME curriculum, which is more suited for MBBS students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Breaks:** Avoid the Pomodoro technique for exam preparation in the final months, as it doesn't prepare for long exam durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Instead, train your mind for long stretches (2.5-3 hours) of vigilant study. Take 15-minute breaks, and manage social media use during these breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Timetables:** An integrated, system-wise timetable might lead to neglect of non-systemic subjects like General Pathology, Forensic Medicine, and Biochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The current subject-wise timetable with daily medicine integration helps cover all areas.
*   **Self-Blame:** Do not dwell on past exam results or low grand test scores. Treat today as a fresh start and commit to the study plan with honesty and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. GT scores are often designed to be tougher to provide an extra push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Note-Taking:** Focus on main keywords and understanding rather than writing down every detail. It's not feasible to write everything in notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Last-Day Study:** For the last week/day, refer to curated topics and LRR sessions provided by faculties, as they select high-yield areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

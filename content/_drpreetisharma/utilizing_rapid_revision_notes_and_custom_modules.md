Preparing for NEET PG 2025 requires a well-structured plan, especially given the uncertainties surrounding exam dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This guide outlines how to effectively use rapid revision notes and custom modules, as well as general [[exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation strategies]], to maximize your preparation.

## Strategic Planning and Timetable
It is crucial to create a plan that allows you to finish the syllabus comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Waiting for the official exam date is not advisable, as it might be too close to the exam for adequate preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A suggested 65-day plan is provided, which can be extended for interns by adding 2-3 days for long subjects and one day for short subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This timetable balances subjects and includes occasional Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

> "Making a timetable is the easiest thing to do on this planet. Following them is the toughest thing to do on this planet." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>
Discipline and willpower are essential to stick to the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. While maintaining focus, avoid mental exhaustion, especially without a fixed deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Timetable Breakdown (Example for a First Read/Revision)
This example is for a 65-day plan, customizable for individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>:
*   **Anatomy**: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   **Orthopedics, Psychiatry, Dermatology, Anesthesia, Radiology**: 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   **Biochemistry**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   **ENT**: 3 days (due to increasing difficulty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   **Pathology**: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   **Microbiology**: 4 days (despite being a 15-hour video lecture subject) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   **PSM**: 5 days (can be 6 if needed due to its nature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
*   **Surgery**: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   **OBGY**: 6 days (for a first, extensive read with MCQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   **Ophthalmology**: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
*   **Pediatrics**: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>
*   **Pharmacology**: 5 days (4 days for subject + 1 day for GT analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   **Physiology**: 2 days (often done later as it overlaps with other subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>

## Utilizing Rapid Revision Notes
[[role_of_rapid_revision_in_fmge_success | Rapid revision]] videos and notes are highly recommended, especially for subjects like Pathology (approx. 20 hours) and Microbiology (approx. 15 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### When to Use Rapid Revision
*   **If you've seen it earlier**: Stick to the version you've already used (e.g., RR 5.0). Review the PDF file with the list of extra topics in newer versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **If you've never viewed any videos**: Start directly with the latest Rapid Revision version (e.g., RR 6.0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **For working doctors/interns**: Rely heavily on rapid revision, as main videos might be too time-consuming (requiring 12+ hours daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. If you encounter a difficult topic, you can fall back to the main videos for specific concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   **For subsequent revisions**: After your first full read, narrow down your content using rapid revision notes. The goal is to filter topics so that the third or fourth revision can be completed in about 10 days, focusing only on volatile topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Content of Rapid Revision
Rapid Revision condenses the extensive content of main videos into a more manageable format, often using tables to consolidate information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. While it may not cover 100% of the Q-bank, it enables you to solve 85-90% of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

### [[choosing_between_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_for_different_subjects | Main Notes vs. Rapid Revision Notes]]
If you've studied main videos long ago, switching to rapid revision for subsequent revisions is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. Repeatedly watching videos you've recently seen (within 6 months) can lead to overconfidence without actual [[active_recall_techniques | active recall]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. After the first passive learning phase with videos, focus on your notes for active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## Incorporating Custom Modules (MCQ Practice)
[[importance_of_revision_and_mcq_practice | MCQ practice]] is paramount. A dedicated one hour each morning should be spent on custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### How to Use Custom Modules
*   **Subject-wise progression**: Initially, create custom modules only from subjects you have completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. As you finish more subjects, expand your custom module to include them all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Daily practice**: Aim for about 50 questions in 50 minutes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Mixed bag tests**: Once a full revision is done, your daily 1-hour custom module becomes a "mini Grand Test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. You can alternate between clinicals (Medicine, Surgery) and first/second-year subjects (Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **QBank choice**: If doing your first read, use the full QBank. If it's a subsequent revision, RR QBank can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs) and Analysis
GTs are not merely about scores but serve as a diagnostic tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. For initial GTs, three in 65 days is a good start if you're not comfortable with the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. If you are comfortable, aim for one GT every 15 days, or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Analyzing GT Performance
*   **Immediate analysis**: Analyze your GT score on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   **Layered analysis**:
    1.  **Incorrect answers**: Focus on these first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
    2.  **Guessed answers**: Analyze questions where you were confused between options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.
    3.  **Correct answers**: Quickly scan explanations for correct answers; don't spend too much time on them if you already know the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   **Identify weaknesses**: GTs reveal weaker subjects or topics (factual vs. clinical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.
*   **Improvement strategy**: If your GT score is low, it points to two main issues:
    1.  **Notes/Revision**: Your revision is not up to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
    2.  **Practice**: You are not practicing enough questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.
*   **Don't fear GTs**: View GTs as practice for the final exam. It's better to make mistakes now than in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. If the term "Grand Test" causes anxiety, call it a "custom module practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

## Complementary Study Techniques
*   **Volatile Topics Notebook**: Maintain a separate notebook for volatile topics and GT mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This should only list topic names or specific points to review, not extensive text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Make this yourself, as what one person forgets differs from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This [[effective_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revision technique]] is crucial for the last 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Medicine Integration**: Instead of studying Medicine in one stretch, dedicate 1-1.5 hours daily to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This approach makes the subject less toxic and allows for integration with other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Fix a specific time for this daily "clinical posting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Subject Study Order**: For freshers, avoid system-wise study, as it can scatter general subjects (General Pathology, General Microbiology, General Pharmacology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Stick to a subject-wise approach for your first revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. For anatomy, study it alongside allied subjects like Orthopedics, Surgery, and Radiology for repeated exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   **[[pathology_study_techniques_and_mnemonics | Active Recall for Volatile Subjects]]**: For subjects like Biochemistry, Pharmacology, and Microbiology, use active recall methods. Cover your notes and quiz yourself, as in school days, to truly memorize the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

### Overall Strategy
Keep your strategy simple: focus on notes and QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Don't fall for numerous external resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. Consistency and discipline are key to achieving success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Start immediately, even if it's just decluttering your study space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

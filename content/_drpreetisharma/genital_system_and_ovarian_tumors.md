This article focuses on the [[Genital System and Ovarian Tumors | Genital System and Ovarian Tumors]] as part of a discussion on renal and genital pathology [00:00:27], [00:00:49].

## Ovarian Tumors - General Overview
Ovarian tumors can be categorized and understood through key features such as their gross appearance (uni- or multiloculated), fluid content, and microscopic histology [01:03:08]. These elements are crucial for diagnosis and differentiation [01:03:08].

### Serous Cystadenoma
Serous cystadenoma is characterized by:
*   **Clinical Presentation**
    *   Often found in younger patients, such as a 29-year-old female [01:01:44].
    *   Detected as an ovarian cyst on ultrasound [01:01:46].
*   **Gross Appearance**
    *   Typically uniloculated (single cyst) [01:01:54], [01:03:50].
    *   Contains clear watery (serous) fluid [01:01:54], [01:02:48].
*   **Histological Features**
    *   Presence of psammoma bodies [01:02:58].
    *   Lined by ciliated epithelium [01:04:34], [01:04:58].
    *   **Mnemonic:** Single, serous, psammoma, ciliated [01:05:09].

### Mucinous Cystadenoma
In contrast to serous cystadenoma:
*   **Gross Appearance**
    *   Multiloculated (multiple cysts) [01:03:28], [01:03:55].
    *   Contains thick mucin [01:03:31].
*   **Histological Features**
    *   Lined by mucin-containing empty cells [01:04:41], [01:05:04].
    *   **Mnemonic:** Multiple, mucin, mycoid [01:05:13].

### Brenner Tumor
The Brenner tumor is classified under surface epithelial tumors [01:05:35], [01:07:14].
*   **Histological Features**
    *   Characterized by nests of cells similar to the urinary bladder [01:07:48], specifically transitional epithelium [01:06:34].
    *   Key feature is the coffee bean nucleus [01:06:37], which appears as nuclei with a line going through them [01:06:54].
*   **Associations**
    *   While often presenting with features similar to bladder epithelium, it is crucial to note that Brenner tumors can be associated with other ovarian tumor components, most commonly [[Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors and Their Mutations | mucinous cystadenoma]] in about 25% of cases [01:09:07], [01:09:25].
    *   Walthard cell rest, a normal embryonic derivative resembling transitional epithelium found in miscellaneous sites like the fallopian tube or ovary, is not a disease [01:08:12], [01:08:16].

### [[Granulosa cell tumor pathology and histological features | Granulosa Cell Tumor]]
[[Granulosa cell tumor pathology and histological features | Granulosa Cell Tumor]] is an important ovarian tumor, often presenting in post-menopausal females [01:09:41].
*   **Clinical Presentation**
    *   Typically seen in older females (e.g., 54-year-old post-menopausal) [01:10:40].
    *   Can present with symptoms like post-menopausal bleeding due to increased estrogen levels, leading to a bulky uterus (endometrial thickening) [01:10:57], which is unusual for post-menopausal women [01:10:48].
*   **Pathogenesis and Characteristics**
    *   These tumors are characterized by hyperestrogenism, meaning high estrogen levels [01:11:00], [01:11:40], [01:11:50].
    *   Positive for CD99 [01:12:01].
    *   Associated with FOXL2 gene mutation [01:13:31].
*   **Histological Features**
    *   Presence of Call-Exner bodies, which are cells arranged in a round appearance with pink material in the center [01:12:59].
    *   Nuclear grooves are seen, also described as coffee bean nuclei [01:13:48], [01:12:06].
*   **Tumor Marker**
    *   Inhibin is the tumor marker [01:12:38].

### Leydig Cell Tumor
*   **Histological Features**
    *   Reinke's crystalloids are seen in Leydig cell tumors [01:14:18], [01:14:27].

### Tumor Markers for Germ Cell Tumors (Brief mention)
*   **Yolk Sac Tumor:** Associated with Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) [01:19:01], [01:19:04].
*   **Dysgerminoma:** Similar to seminoma, markers include LDH and PLAP [01:19:08], [01:19:15].

Effective [[time_management_and_study_schedule_for_fmge | time management]] and the establishment of [[daily_targets_and_time_management_for_medical_exams | daily targets]] are crucial for students preparing for the FMG (Foreign Medical Graduate) exam, especially with the exam date set for January 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This guide outlines a comprehensive [[developing_effective_timetables_for_exam_preparation | timetable]] and strategies for the remaining preparation period.

## Core Study Principles

*   **Integrated Study**: Students should practice MCQs alongside theory every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision (RR)**: Primarily use rapid revision videos and notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, referring to main videos only for clarifying doubts that are not clear from RR material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This applies to all subjects, including Pathology and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **Source Consistency**: Do not change your study source (e.g., app, crash course) if you have already been studying from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. If starting fresh, PrepLadder's rapid revision is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

## Daily Study Hours

Students should aim for at least 10 to 12 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This translates to 10 *effective* hours, accounting for time wastage due to anxiety, panic, or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Question Practice

*   **MCQs**: Aim for 100+ MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. These are often integrated into your daily theory study (e.g., 20-25 MCQs per chapter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. If 100 seems overwhelming, start with 50 and gradually increase by 5-7 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Source of Questions**: Utilize a question bank from your chosen platform and previous year *topics* (not just rote questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. FMG Solutions textbooks are also an option for previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **PYQs**: Focus on understanding the topics from previous year questions (PYQs), not just mugging up the questions themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Last 15-20 Days**: Continue to solve questions daily, even in the last 15-20 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.

## Timetable Structure: Two Rounds of Revision

The provided [[developing_effective_timetables_for_exam_preparation | timetable]] consists of two main rounds of revision, leading up to the January 20th exam.

### Round 1: Foundational Revision (Until December 24th)

This round focuses on completing all 19 subjects. No "breathing space" is allocated, meaning study starts immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

*   **Subject-wise Allocation**:
    *   Anatomy: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
    *   Orthopedics: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
    *   Biochemistry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>
    *   Pathology: 3 days (Nov 20, 21, 22) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
    *   Psychiatry: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>
    *   ENT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
    *   Dermatology: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
    *   PSM: 4 days (focus on main topics due to unpredictable questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
    *   Anesthesia: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>
    *   Microbiology: 3 days (Dec 2, 3, 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>
    *   Surgery: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>
    *   Radiology: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>
    *   OBG: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
    *   Ophthalmology: 2 days (due to tough topics like neuro-ophthalmology, squint) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
    *   Pharmacology: 3 days (placed towards the end for better retention) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>
    *   Pediatrics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>
    *   Forensic Medicine: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>
    *   Physiology: 2 days (last two days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   **Medicine**: Do not dedicate a block of days to Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Instead, start medicine from November 23rd, allocating 1 to 1.5 hours per day, continuing until January 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This allows for consistent exposure and leverages prior knowledge from Pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Round 2: Intensive Revision (December 25th - January 13th)

This round aims for quicker revision of all subjects.

*   **Subject-wise Allocation**:
    *   Short subjects (Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, Skin): 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>
    *   ENT, Ophthalmology: 2.5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>
    *   PSM: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>
    *   OBG: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>
    *   Surgery: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>
    *   Physiology, Pediatrics: 1 day each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>
    *   Volatile subjects (Biochemistry, Anatomy, Pharmacology): 2 days each, studied closer to the exam for better retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Pathology and Microbiology**: After December 24th, these subjects will be covered through daily, small targets (30-40 minutes) provided by the instructor, aiming to finish before January 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### Round 3: Final Consolidation (January 13th - January 19th)

This final week should be dedicated to solving previous year questions and reviewing volatile topics that have been challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

*   **Minimum GTs**: Aim to take at least 5 Grand Tests (GTs) before the January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: GTs are for [[time_management_during_exams | time management]] and identifying weak areas, not for judging scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   **Correct Questions**: Do not read explanations for correct answers from textbooks. Instead, quickly revisit your notes for those topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
    *   **Incorrect Questions**: Read explanations thoroughly from the source where you took the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.
*   **Pacing**: Practice maintaining a pace of 45-50 seconds per question to keep your mind alert throughout the exam duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Scores**: Do not get disheartened by GT scores. Platform GTs are often tougher than the actual exam to encourage more study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. A 150+ in GTs could mean 170-180+ in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

## Study Techniques & Overcoming Challenges

*   **Note-taking for Revision**: While studying, highlight only the 5 most important words on each page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. This makes last-day revision quick and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Forgetting**: Forgetting is a natural human tendency. Accept it and create a cycle of reading, forgetting, and re-reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Don't expect to remember everything perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Mental and Physical Health**:
    *   **Physical**: Allocate 30-40 minutes daily for physical activity, like a walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
    *   **Mental**: Engage in stress-busting activities such as deep breathing, drinking water, balanced diet, or 10-15 minutes of meditation/yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. The main aim is to keep your heart rate normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
*   **Addressing Negativity**: Avoid negative conversations about the exam difficulty or pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. Focus on your effort and maintain a positive outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: Your internal dedication to change your life after January 20th is the strongest motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. Visualize your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.
*   **Starting from Zero**: Even if you feel you haven't studied, it's possible to pass by starting from zero and dedicating 12 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. Crossing 150 marks is "100% possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.
*   **Customization**: While the provided [[developing_effective_timetables_for_exam_preparation | timetable]] is comprehensive, it can be customized. If you've already completed a revision, you can reduce the days for subjects to gain extra time for another revision round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

> [!tip] Discipline
> Establish a fixed time for daily medicine study (e.g., 10-11 AM) and adhere to it strictly as a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

> [!caution] Avoid These Pitfalls
> *   Don't change your study source at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
> *   Don't only focus on MCQs or only on notes; balance them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
> *   Don't be overly statistic-driven by focusing on the exact number of questions solved per subject, rather than topic completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

This [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | strategy]] is designed to help students maximize their potential in the remaining time and achieve success in the FMGE exam.

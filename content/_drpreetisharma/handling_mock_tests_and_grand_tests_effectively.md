In the crucial days leading up to an exam, effectively [[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | handling Grand Tests]] (GTs) and mock tests is vital for success [00:05:11]. The primary focus should shift from achieving high scores to refining [[handling_exam_anxiety_and_motivation_tactics | exam preparation strategies]] and managing performance.

## To Give or Not to Give a Grand Test in the Last 10 Days?
For students with 9-10 days remaining until the exam, the decision to take a GT is a personal one [00:05:21], [00:05:39].
*   **If you are prone to panic or anxiety** over scores, it's generally advised *not* to give a GT in the final days [00:05:21], [00:05:29]. A low score can demotivate and hinder further study [00:05:31].
*   **If you can handle the pressure** and maintain a positive mindset regardless of the score, then proceed [00:05:39], [00:05:44].

### Focus During Grand Tests
If you choose to take a GT, or when practicing MCQs, shift your focus from the score itself to other critical aspects:
*   **[[handling_exam_anxiety_and_motivation_tactics | Time Management]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>: Ensure you can complete all 300 questions within the allotted time, ideally with 20 minutes to spare [00:06:28], [00:06:45].
*   **Catching [[managing_exam_anxiety_and_stress | Silly Mistakes]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>: Identify recurring errors due to carelessness (e.g., misreading questions).
*   **Score is Secondary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>: Do not let the GT score (e.g., whether you crossed 150+) impact your [[handling_exam_anxiety_and_motivation_tactics | motivation]] or confidence for the actual exam [00:08:44], [00:51:16].

### Alternative Practice Method
If you choose not to take a full GT, you can simulate the exam environment by:
*   Making a set of 300 MCQs based on the exam pattern [00:06:07].
*   Practicing [[handling_exam_anxiety_and_motivation_tactics | time management]] with this set [00:06:12].

## Analyzing Grand Test Results and MCQs
Effective analysis of your performance is crucial for [[exam_preparation_strategies | improvement]].

### Approach to MCQs
*   **Correct MCQs:** Do not read explanations for questions you answered correctly, as this indicates you already possess the knowledge [00:07:16], [00:07:21].
*   **Incorrect MCQs:**
    *   Review explanations superficially to understand why you got it wrong [00:07:29], [00:07:31].
    *   Distinguish between a [[managing_exam_anxiety_and_stress | silly mistake]] and a knowledge gap [00:07:34], [00:07:36].
    *   If it's a knowledge problem, quickly read 5-10 lines on that specific topic [00:07:41], [00:07:48]. Avoid deep dives (e.g., "PhD on that topic") [00:07:46].

### Handling New Questions
*   Every GT, and indeed the actual exam, will have 20-30 "bouncers" â€“ questions you haven't seen or heard before [00:07:56], [00:08:03], [00:42:08].
*   Do not let these new questions demoralize you or make you feel unprepared [00:08:19], [00:42:16]. Your pass/fail is not determined by these 20-30 questions [00:08:26].
*   Instead, focus on performing well on the topics you *do* know and avoiding [[managing_exam_anxiety_and_stress | silly mistakes]] [00:08:29], [00:42:27].

## Managing Scores and Confidence
*   Scores in GTs (e.g., 100, 120, 150, 200) should not be the primary concern in the last 9 days [00:50:46], [00:50:53].
*   The goal is to maximize your effort in the remaining time to cross the 150+ mark in the actual exam [00:50:56], [00:51:11].
*   If your GT scores are consistently high (e.g., 170-190+), maintain your current [[exam_preparation_strategies | strategy]] and trust your process [00:37:02], [00:38:29], [00:46:54], [00:46:59].

## Exam Day Strategy (Simulated in GTs)
*   The FMG exam often has two papers: one super easy and one super tough [00:39:48], [00:40:45].
*   Mentally prepare for this variability [00:41:09].
*   During the break between papers, *do not discuss paper one* [00:40:19], [00:40:24]. Disconnect from it like a "bad dream" and focus entirely on paper two, aiming to cover up any perceived shortcomings from the first paper [00:40:30], [00:40:35]. This prevents the hangover of paper one from negatively impacting paper two [00:40:39].
*   The overall score is what matters for passing [00:41:27].

## Quantity and Type of Practice Questions
*   **Daily Target:** Aim to solve a minimum of 150+ MCQs daily [00:21:12], [00:34:25]. Some successful students have done 300 daily [00:21:21], [00:34:34].
*   **Gradual Increase:** If currently solving fewer (e.g., 100), incrementally increase the number by 10-20 questions each day [00:34:55].
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs):**
    *   [[fmg_exam_preparation | FMG exam preparation]] must include the last five years of PYQs [00:26:18], [00:26:26]. There is no escape from this [00:26:24].
    *   If time permits, review the last three years of [[importance_of_question_banks_and_mcqs_in_exam_preparation | NEET PG questions]] [00:26:30], [00:26:34], [00:27:05].
    *   If still more time, the single IAI CET exam paper from November can be reviewed [00:27:17], [00:27:20].
    *   **Important Note:** Do not just memorize PYQ answers [00:22:00], [00:22:18], [00:22:55]. PYQs are rarely copied directly [00:22:25]. Instead, focus on understanding the *topics* from which PYQs are derived [00:22:29], [00:22:31]. Solve [[importance_of_question_banks_and_mcqs_in_exam_preparation | MCQs]] related to these previous year topics from question banks [00:22:40].
*   **Resources for PYQs:** You can use FMG solution books or app-based question banks [00:35:16], [00:35:20], [00:35:27]. For those unable to open books, consider watching "flashback sessions" or recall sessions on YouTube that cover all 19 subjects' PYQs [00:35:56], [00:36:06], [00:36:31], [00:52:12]. Listen at 1.5x or 2x speed if needed [00:28:06], [00:49:43].

This structured approach to mock tests and GTs, focusing on process and learning rather than just scores, will significantly contribute to your [[fmg_exam_preparation | exam preparation]].

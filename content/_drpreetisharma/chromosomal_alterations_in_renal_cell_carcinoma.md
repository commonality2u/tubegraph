[[Renal Pathology and Cancers | Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)]] is a malignant tumor originating from the kidney. The diagnosis and classification of RCC often involve identifying specific histological features and associated [[genetic_alterations_in_thyroid_cancer | genetic alterations]], particularly chromosomal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Types of Renal Cell Carcinoma and Their Chromosomal Alterations

### Clear Cell RCC (CCC)
*   **Prevalence**: This is the most common type of RCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alteration**: It is characterized by the deletion of chromosome 3p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndrome**: Clear Cell RCC is typically associated with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Histologically, it presents with empty, clear cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, appearing white or empty in microscopic images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Papillary RCC
*   **Genetic Alterations**:
    *   Trisomy of chromosomes 7 and 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   Loss of the Y chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   Mutation in the Fumarate Hydratase (FH) gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This specific mutation is associated with Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and RCC (HLRCC), which also involves multiple leiomyomas (fibroids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Associated Conditions**: Papillary RCC is associated with a history of dialysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Histologically, it shows tall cells arranged in papillae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, and often contains psammoma bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Chromophobe RCC
*   **Genetic Alterations**: Characterized by multiple chromosomal losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, such as chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 10, and 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This is metaphorically described as having "phobia" or fear of chromosomes, causing them to "run away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndrome**: This type is associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, which can also involve skin appendage tumors like fibrofolliculomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Histology**: The cells resemble "plant cells" with distinct outlines, a central "resinoid" nucleus, and a peri-nuclear halo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Special Stain**: It stains positive with Hale's Colloidal Iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Medullary RCC
*   **Associated Condition**: Strongly associated with sickle cell trait, not sickle cell anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. It is important to differentiate between the two, as sickle cell trait (e.g., HbAS) is the risk factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

### Pediatric RCC
*   **Genetic Alteration**: Associated with Xp11 translocations involving the TFE3 gene (referred to as "toffee gene") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Age Presentation**: While predominantly a childhood cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, it can rarely occur in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Age should not be the sole deciding factor for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Angiomyolipoma (AML)
*   **Nature**: AML is a benign renal tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, characterized by the presence of blood vessels (angio), muscle (myo), and fat (lipoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndrome**: It is associated with tuberous sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, which involves mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Tuberous sclerosis can also present with cardiac rhabdomyomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, which feature spider cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Renal Oncocytoma
*   **Nature**: A benign renal tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Characterized by oncocytes, which are cells rich in mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. The tumor typically has a mahogany brown color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a> and a characteristic central stellate scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. This scar is a notable feature shared by tumors in various organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

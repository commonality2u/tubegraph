*E. coli* is a common bacterium that can cause various infections, with two primary concerns being urinary tract infections (UTIs) and diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>. There are several strains of *E. coli* specifically known to cause diarrheal diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

## Types of Diarrhea-Causing *E. coli* Strains

### Enteropathogenic *E. coli* (EPEC)
*   **Characteristics:** EPEC is characterized by its pathogenic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>.
*   **Disease:** It is a common cause of infantile diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>, often associated with pediatric cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.

### Enterotoxigenic *E. coli* (ETEC)
*   **Characteristics:** ETEC is distinguished by its toxigenic properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   **Disease:** It is the primary cause of travelers' diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>. Antimicrobials are typically administered for this type of bacterial diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>.

### Enteroinvasive *E. coli* (EIEC)
*   **Characteristics:** EIEC has invasive capabilities, meaning it can penetrate and spread within the cells of the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.
*   **Disease:** This invasion leads to bleeding in the stools, a condition known as dysentery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

### Enterohemorrhagic *E. coli* (EHEC)
*   **Characteristics:** EHEC is associated with causing hemorrhage or bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>.
*   **Disease:** It is notably responsible for Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>. The specific strain of EHEC causing HUS is O157:H7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>.

#### Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)
HUS is a serious condition where blood breaks down (hemolytic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a> and the kidneys are affected (uremic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. It presents with a classical triad, sometimes referred to as the "RAT triad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>:
*   **R**enal insufficiency (kidney involvement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>
*   **A**nemia (specifically hemolytic anemia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>
*   **T**hrombocytopenia (low platelet count, indicating thrombus formation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>

### Enteroaggregative *E. coli* (EAEC)
*   **Disease:** EAEC is associated with persistent diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>, often having a longer duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>.
*   **Laboratory Identification:** When grown on Hep-2 cell lines, EAEC gives a characteristic "stacked brick" or "aggregated brick" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>.

Whipple's disease is a condition primarily characterized by specific [[Histological and cytological appearances in pathology | histological appearances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> and is caused by the gram-positive bacterium *Tropheryma whipplei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
The disease typically leads to malabsorption, where the intestine's ability to absorb nutrients is significantly impaired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Histopathological Findings
The characteristic [[Histological and cytological appearances in pathology | histopathology]] for Whipple's disease is the presence of PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Microscopic Appearance
Upon [[Histological and cytological appearances in pathology | histological examination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>:
*   **Intestinal Villi:** Intestinal villi are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Goblet Cells:** The presence of goblet cells confirms the tissue is from the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Foam Cells:** In the lamina propria (below the goblet cells), whitish cells are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. These are known as "foam cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. These foam cells are macrophages that have engulfed *Tropheryma whipplei* bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Special Staining
To confirm the nature of the foam cells, a Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The whitish foam cells will stain pinkish with the PAS stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, confirming them as PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis
When foam cells are observed on [[Histological and cytological appearances in pathology | histopathology]], the differential diagnosis includes Whipple's disease and Tuberculosis (TB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Macrophages in TB also engulf the causative bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. To differentiate, TB will be positive for an acid-fast stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

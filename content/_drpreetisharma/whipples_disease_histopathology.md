Whipple's disease is a condition caused by the gram-positive bacterium *Tropheryma whipplei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. It primarily leads to [[pathological_features_of_various_diseases | malabsorption]] in the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Characteristic Histopathological Features
The classical histopathology of Whipple's disease involves the presence of PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

When examining the intestine, normally one would observe intestinal villi and goblet cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. However, in Whipple's disease, within the lamina propria (the layer below the goblet cells), whitish cells known as foam cells are seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. These foam cells are macrophages that have engulfed *Tropheryma whipplei* bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

To confirm the presence of *Tropheryma whipplei* within these foam cells, a special stain called PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. When a PAS stain is applied, the whitish foam cells turn pinkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Thus, the diagnostic finding for Whipple's disease is [[histological_and_cytological_features_in_pathology | PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis
When foam cells are observed on [[histological_and_cytological_features_in_pathology | histopathology]], two main [[differential_diagnosis_in_pathology | differential diagnoses]] should be considered: Whipple's disease and Tuberculosis (TB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Macrophages will also engulf TB bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

To differentiate between the two, a specific test for TB is performed: TB will be positive for the acid-fast stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

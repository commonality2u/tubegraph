Whipple's disease is a condition caused by the gram-positive bacterium *Tropheryma whipplei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:49">[09:20:49]</a>. This infection primarily leads to malabsorption, affecting the intestine's ability to absorb nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:51">[09:32:51]</a>.

## Characteristic Histopathology

The classical histopathological finding for Whipple's disease is the presence of PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) positive macrophages within the lamina propria of the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:57">[09:37:57]</a>.

### Microscopic Appearance

*   **Intestinal Villi:** On microscopic examination, the image will show intestinal villi and goblet cells, indicating intestinal tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:38">[09:47:38]</a>.
*   **Foam Cells:** Within the lamina propria, located beneath the goblet cells, whitish-appearing cells known as "foam cells" are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:05">[10:07:05]</a>.
*   **Nature of Foam Cells:** These foam cells are, in fact, macrophages that have engulfed *Tropheryma whipplei* bacteria, making them appear foamy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:12">[10:12:12]</a>.
*   **PAS Stain:** To confirm the presence of *Tropheryma whipplei* within these macrophages, a PAS stain is applied. This stain turns the whitish foam cells pinkish, demonstrating their PAS positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:43">[10:28:43]</a>. The presence of PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria is diagnostic for Whipple's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:34">[10:45:34]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis

When foam cells are identified on histopathology, Whipple's disease is a primary differential diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:56">[10:56:56]</a>. Another important consideration is tuberculosis (TB), as macrophages will also engulf TB bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:46">[11:01:46]</a>. To differentiate between the two, TB would be positive for an acid-fast stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:02">[11:10:02]</a>.

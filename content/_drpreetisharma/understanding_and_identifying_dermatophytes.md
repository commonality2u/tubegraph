Dermatophytes are a group of fungi known to cause infections of the skin, hair, and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations
Dermatophyte infections are broadly categorized by the affected body part:
*   **Trichophyton**: Affects skin, hair, and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Microsporum**: Affects skin and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.
*   **Epidermophyton**: Primarily affects skin and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Microscopic Identification
When examining dermatophytes under a microscope, key features to observe include the shape of macroconidia and the quantity of microconidia.

### Key Genera and Conidia Shapes
The three main genera of dermatophytes are Trichophyton (T), Microsporum (M), and Epidermophyton (E) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Their macroconidia (large spores) exhibit distinct shapes:
*   **Trichophyton**: Pencil-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Microsporum**: Spindle-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Epidermophyton**: Club-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
    *   *Mnemonic for Macroconidia*: **P**encil, **S**pindle, **C**lub (**PSC**) corresponds to TME (Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Microconidia
For microconidia (small spores) across the three genera:
*   The quantity goes from maximum to minimum (Max to Min) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, meaning Trichophyton has the most, and Epidermophyton has the fewest (often absent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

## Staining Techniques
Dermatophyte specimens are typically stained using Lacto-phenol cotton blue. This stain imparts a blue color to the fungal structures, making them visible under the microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

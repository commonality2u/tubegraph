DiGeorge Syndrome is a genetic disorder primarily characterized by a deletion on chromosome 22. It is famously associated with the "Catch-22" mnemonic, which helps recall its key features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Catch-22 Mnemonic Explained

The mnemonic "Catch-22" refers to:

*   **C**ardiac abnormalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. While many cardiac abnormalities can occur, Tetralogy of Fallot (Toff) is frequently questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **A**bnormal faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, which can include dysmorphic features and cleft lip/palate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The patient in the case presented with a dysmorphic face and cleft palate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **T**hymic hypoplasia or aplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. An absent thymic shadow on a chest X-ray is a characteristic finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This leads to impaired T-cell development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a> and recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, as observed in the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **C**left palate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **H**ypocalcemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, due to underdeveloped parathyroid glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. A decrease in parathyroid hormone leads to decreased calcium levels, which is responsible for seizures in affected individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The patient presented with severe muscle spasms and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **22** refers to the deletion on chromosome 22q11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Genetic Basis and Associated Conditions

DiGeorge Syndrome is caused by a deletion on chromosome 22q11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Specifically, the gene affected is **TBX1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Problems with the TBX1 gene have also been associated with psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

It is important to differentiate this from a deletion on chromosome 11q22, which is associated with [[peutzjeghers_syndrome_and_stk11_mutation | Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Diagnosis

The specific deletion associated with DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion) can be identified using **FISH analysis** (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

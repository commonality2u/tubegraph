The role of biopsy in detecting granulomas is crucial for the definitive diagnosis of various [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | pathological conditions]]. This process often involves initial investigation with Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) followed by a confirmatory biopsy. Both [[microbiological_and_histological_examination_techniques | histological examination techniques]] are essential in the [[importance_of_image_interpretation_in_pathology | image interpretation]] of cell structures to arrive at a diagnosis like [[granulomatous_lymphadenitis_diagnosis | granulomatous lymphadenitis]].

### Initial Assessment: FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
For conditions presenting as a neck swelling, a Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is often the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Key findings on FNAC suggestive of a granuloma include:
*   **Multi-nucleated Giant Cells:** These are large cells containing multiple nuclei and are very characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. They can be very large with numerous nuclei inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Epithelioid Cells:** These cells appear with elongated or "slipper-shaped" nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The combination of multi-nucleated giant cells and slipper-shaped epithelioid cells strongly suggests a granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Confirmatory Diagnosis: Biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
Findings from FNAC are often corroborated by a biopsy, which provides a more detailed histological view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

On biopsy, a classic granuloma structure includes:
*   **Giant Cells:** Similar to FNAC, biopsy reveals huge cells with many nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Epithelioid Cells:** These are visible with their characteristic elongated, slipper-shaped nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Lymphocytic Collar:** Small, blue-colored lymphocytes often surround the periphery of the granuloma, forming a "lymphocytic collar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

These three components — giant cells, epithelioid cells, and a lymphocytic collar — constitute a granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. A granuloma can be identified even without giant cells if epithelioid cells are present and surrounded by a lymphocytic collar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Identifying Caseous Necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
In cases like tuberculosis (TB), where granulomas are commonly seen, an additional feature known as caseous necrosis might be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Gross Appearance:** A lymph node affected by caseous necrosis will show a "cheesy appearance" on its cut surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **FNAC Appearance:** On FNAC, caseous necrosis appears as a pink, granular, non-homogeneous material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This granular material is indicative of cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Granulomatous lymphadenitis is characterized by the presence of giant cells, epithelioid cells, and a lymphocytic collar, which can be identified through both FNAC and biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Preparing for exams like NEET PG involves strategic planning, including the effective use of Grand Tests (GTs) to assess and improve performance. It's crucial to understand their purpose and how to approach them to maximize their benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

## The Purpose of Grand Tests

A Grand Test is not merely about achieving a high score; rather, it serves as a guide for your study direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. It helps identify your strengths and weaknesses, informing you on which subjects or topics require more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

## Recommended Grand Test Frequency

The frequency of taking GTs depends on your current level of syllabus comfort:
*   **If you are not yet comfortable with your syllabus** (e.g., in the early stages of a 65-day plan), three Grand Tests may be sufficient to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **If you are comfortable with your syllabus**, aim for one Grand Test every 15 days, or even every Sunday for excellent practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Avoid taking GTs too early** if you've only covered a couple of subjects, as it may feel illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Overcoming Grand Test Anxiety

Many students experience anxiety when facing GTs. Here's how to manage it:

### Embrace Mistakes and Practice
*   "Finish your failing quota right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. It's better to make mistakes and fail in GTs now than in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.
*   Practice giving GTs to face your fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Your confidence will gradually build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

### Redefine "Grand Test"
*   The term "Grand Test" itself can cause anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   Instead of calling it a "Grand Test," label it as a "custom module" or "practice question module" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.
*   You can start by creating mixed-bag custom modules of 50 questions, giving four sets of these in a day within a time frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>. Once you're comfortable with this, then attempt a full GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Don't Obsess Over the Score
*   The score is just a number that fluctuates between platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. It's a byproduct of your approach and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
*   Keep your GT score a secret if it helps with your anxiety until you achieve a good score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

## Grand Test Score Analysis

Analyze your GT results on the same day you take the test, focusing on subject-wise and question-type analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

### Prioritize Analysis Layers
Analyze your GT in layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>:
1.  **Incorrect Questions:** Focus on these first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
2.  **Confused Guesses:** Analyze questions where you were confused between options or made an intelligent guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.
3.  **Correct Questions:** Quickly scan explanations for questions you answered correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. Don't spend excessive time re-reading explanations for things you already know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

### Identify Weak Areas and Actionable Steps
*   **Subject-wise Analysis:** Determine which subjects consistently show incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   **Question Type Analysis:** Differentiate between factual errors and clinical errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.
    *   **Factual Questions Wrong:** This means you need to strengthen subjects like Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>, which often involve rote learning.
    *   **Clinical Questions Wrong:** This indicates a need to practice more Medicine and Surgery questions in your custom module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
*   **Note Revision:** If you have problems with recall, it's time to revise your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   **Question Practice:** If your scores aren't improving despite studying, you might be lagging in McQ management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. Increase the number of questions you solve daily (e.g., from 40 to 60 or 60 to 80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
*   **Time Management:** If you struggle with time management, practice with a timer, aiming to solve each question within 42-45 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.

### Two Key Diagnoses for Low GT Scores
If your GT scores are low, there are typically only two root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>:
1.  **Problem with Notes/Revision:** Your notes or revision strategy might not be up to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
2.  **Insufficient Question Practice:** You are not practicing enough questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

Cholera toxin is a key virulence factor produced by *Vibrio cholerae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. *Vibrio cholerae* also produces another toxin called zonula occludens toxin (Zot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Both cholera toxin and Zot are frequently discussed in previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Cholera Toxin Structure
Cholera toxin consists of two main fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>:
*   **Fragment B** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>
*   **Fragment A** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>

## Mechanism of Action
The two fragments perform distinct roles in the toxin's action:
*   **Fragment B (Binding)**: This fragment is responsible for binding to the intestinal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Specifically, Fragment B binds to GM1 ganglioside on the surface of the intestinal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Fragment A (Action)**: After Fragment B facilitates binding, Fragment A carries out the mechanism of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Fragment A primarily activates adenylate cyclase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, which leads to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This increase in cAMP ultimately leads to the characteristic "rice water stools" associated with cholera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

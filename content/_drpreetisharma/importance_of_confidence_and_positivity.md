Confidence and a positive mindset are crucial for success, particularly during stressful periods like exam preparation. Maintaining a positive outlook can significantly impact performance, reduce stress, and help navigate challenges effectively.

## Managing Pre-Exam Anxiety
It is normal to experience panic, an elevated heart rate, and palpitations before an exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. To manage this, it's advised to wrap up studying early in the evening, ideally by 7:00 or 7:30 PM, to allow time to settle down and ensure a good night's sleep, which is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Exam Day Logistics and Mindset
On the day of the exam, it's recommended to arrive early to give yourself time to calm down and normalize your heart rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Avoiding External Distractions
Between exam papers, avoid discussing questions or answers with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Engaging in such discussions can lead to unnecessary anxiety if you discover a mistake or can't recall an answer, potentially jeopardizing your performance in the subsequent paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Instead, focus on light refreshments that provide energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Approaching Questions with a "Switch On, Switch Off" Mode
Adopt a "switch on, switch off" approach for each question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Focus entirely on the current question, then mentally "switch off" from it and move to the next, avoiding dwelling on past questions or anticipating future ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Handling Difficult Questions
Expect some questions to be "bouncers"â€”questions that even experts might struggle with, designed to screen candidates in a competitive exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These questions are not meant for everyone to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Do not let these challenging questions demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If you encounter such a question, make an educated guess and move on without dwelling on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Prioritizing Easy Questions
Focus on answering easier questions accurately, as making silly mistakes in these can be more detrimental than missing tough ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Regret over silly mistakes can last a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Overcoming Negativity and Self-Doubt
Negativity can lead to careless errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Instead, cultivate a positive mindset by:
*   **Counting blessings:** Acknowledge the support of family, teachers, and a higher power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Believing that good things will happen can normalize your heart rate and prevent silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This aligns with [[techniques_for_maintaining_positivity_and_focus_during_exam_preparation | techniques for maintaining positivity and focus]] and the [[role_of_faith_and_support_in_exam_success | role of faith and support]] in exam success.
*   **Believing in yourself:** Despite feelings of self-doubt or forgetting information, trust in your preparation and the knowledge you possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Your first gut feeling is often correct, especially when not under extreme pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Accepting human error:** It's normal to make a few silly mistakes. The goal is to prevent these from escalating due to panic and [[handling_examrelated_anxiety_and_stress | anxiety]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This is part of [[managing_exam_anxiety | managing exam anxiety]].

### The Power of Faith
Holding onto faith, whether in God, the universe, energy, or the blessings of parents and teachers, provides security and wards off negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This belief can help overcome [[handling_setbacks_and_maintaining_motivation_in_exam_preparation | setbacks]] and maintain motivation.

> "Whatever is your superstition stick to that you sometimes need some faith in life some belief in life whether it is real or it is virtual you need to stick to that faith because that gives you security that till the time I am thinking and I am with this thing nothing bad will happen to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>

## Maintaining Confidence During the Exam
It is vital to be confident before entering the exam hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Believe that your preparation, strategy, teachers, and sources were the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. Once you start the exam, shift to a practical mindset, reading every question and option carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Even if a question seems familiar, read it completely to avoid missing twists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

### Pacing Yourself
The exam will be balanced, with some quick one-liner questions and some lengthy ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. Don't worry if a question takes longer than the average time, as other questions will compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. It's also normal for the first 10-15 minutes of the exam to feel slower as you settle in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Broader Perspective on Life and Exams
Remember that an exam is just one challenge among many in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. While it may seem the most important at the moment, it is merely a formality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Your worth is not defined by a single exam result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Those who truly care about you, like your parents and teachers, know your hard work and will stand by you regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Focus on being a fighter and overcoming obstacles, as you have done throughout your struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

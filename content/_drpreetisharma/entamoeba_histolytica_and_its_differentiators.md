**Entamoeba histolytica** is a parasitic protozoan that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms like bloody loose stools, fever, and abdominal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. It is crucial to differentiate it from other non-pathogenic amoebas like *Entamoeba coli* because *E. histolytica* requires treatment, whereas *E. coli* is considered a normal organism in stool samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

While both *E. histolytica* and *E. coli* have trophozoite and cyst stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, the number of nuclei in their cysts is **not a good criterion for differentiation** as *E. histolytica* cysts can have 1-4 nuclei, and *E. coli* cysts can have 1-8 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, potentially overlapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

## Key Differentiating Features

### Trophozoite Stage
The trophozoite stage of *Entamoeba histolytica* and *Entamoeba coli* can be differentiated based on several characteristics:

*   **Pseudopodia**
    *   *E. histolytica* exhibits sharp, finger-like pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
    *   *E. coli* displays blunt pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Structure (Karyosome and Peripheral Chromatin)**
    *   *E. histolytica* has a central karyosome and evenly distributed peripheral chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. This gives its nucleus a "perfect" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
    *   *E. coli* has an eccentric (off-center) karyosome and clumped peripheral chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   **Ingested Contents (Erythrophagocytosis)**
    *   *E. histolytica* trophozoites can show [[pathogen_identification_and_characteristics#Erythrophagocytosis|erythrophagocytosis]], meaning they ingest red blood cells (RBCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. This is a very important distinguishing feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
    *   *E. coli* trophozoites do not exhibit erythrophagocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

### Cyst Stage
Key features for differentiating the cyst stage:

*   **Chromatoid Body**
    *   *E. histolytica* cysts have a thick, rod-shaped chromatoid body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
    *   *E. coli* cysts have thin, splinter-like chromatoid bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Composition and Staining of Chromatoid Body**
    *   Chromatoid bodies are made of ribonucleoproteins (RNP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
    *   They stain with Iron Hematoxylin stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations of Entamoeba histolytica
*E. histolytica* causes severe gastritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Intestinal Amoebiasis:** It can cause flask-shaped ulcers in the intestines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **Liver Amoebiasis:** If it spreads to the liver, it causes an amoebic liver abscess, which characteristically presents with an "anchovy sauce" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

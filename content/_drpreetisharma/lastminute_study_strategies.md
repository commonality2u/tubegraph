With exactly 10 days remaining until the January 20th FMGE exam, students should focus on a strategic plan of action for the final stretch, which is considered "make or break" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This advice is specifically for FMGE students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Do's and Don'ts for the Final 10 Days

The most important aspect of these last 10 days is what to do and what not to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Subject Coverage and New Material
*   **Do not study anything entirely new from scratch** if it's a major subject like medicine or surgery that you haven't touched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Do not leave any subject completely untouched** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, as you need to know a little bit about all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The goal is to be able to answer at least five out of ten questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   For subjects you have not studied, at least watch the 3-hour "LRR" session or any platform's crash course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> to solve about 50% of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   For subjects you have already studied (e.g., Pathology), do not start studying rare or new topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Sleep and Alertness
*   **Normalize your sleep cycle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, as the exam is during the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. You need to be alert during morning hours (9 AM, 10 AM, 11 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   Aim for a **minimum of six hours of sleep** to ensure your brain functions effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **Avoid taking new medications** for sleep or alertness, as you don't know the side effects or how your body will react on exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Maintain your regular routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) and MCQs
*   **Personal choice on giving a GT** in the last 9 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>:
    *   If you can handle the pressure and potential low scores positively, go ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   If a low score will cause panic and anxiety, it might be better to avoid it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   If you do give a GT, **focus on [[time_management_during_exams | time management]]** and catching silly mistakes, *not* on the score (e.g., 150+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Do not stop doing MCQs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. If not taking a GT, create a set of 300 MCQs to practice [[time_management_during_exams | time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   When reviewing MCQs:
    *   If an MCQ is correct, **do not read the explanation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   If an MCQ is wrong, read the explanation superficially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Identify if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If a knowledge gap, quickly read 5-10 lines on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   Expect Grand Tests to have 20-30 "bouncer" (new/unfamiliar) questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Your pass/fail is determined by known topics and avoiding silly mistakes, not these bouncers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   Aim to solve at least **150+ MCQs daily** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Gradually increase your daily MCQ count by 10-15 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   Focus on **previous year *topics*** for MCQs, not just memorizing previous year questions, as questions are no longer copied and pasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Solve related MCQs from a Q bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   Complete FMGE's last five years' previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. If time permits, also review NEET PG's last three years' questions (2020-2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>, and then the IAI CET November paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. If you can't solve them yourself, listen to recall sessions on YouTube at 1.5x or 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

### Mental State and Positivity
*   **Focus on positivity** for [[handling_stress_and_optimizing_study_routines_for_neet_pg | anxiety management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Talk only to people who give you positive vibes** (parents, siblings, good friends, teachers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Stay away from negative people** who claim to have completed many revisions or are scoring very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Ignore all rumors** about exam difficulty or pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Do not let negative thoughts enter your mind**, as one day wasted due to negativity means losing progress in 2-3 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   Understand that forgetting subjects is normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>; no one can memorize all 19 subjects perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. If you forget something, simply pick it up and revise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Competitive exams are a mixture of knowledge and mindset** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Your mental stability and approach to the exam are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **One negative thought equals one incorrect MCQ** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Avoid negative thought cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.
*   **Don't worry about logistics** like alarm clocks or computer issues on exam day; block out these thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

## Subject Management Strategy

In the last 9 days, the focus is on becoming a "scanning machine," quickly reviewing everything you've already read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### Short Subjects
*   Allocate about **2.5 days** for short subjects: ENT, Ophthalmology, Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, and Dermatology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   For these, watch YouTube LRR (Last Minute Revision) sessions and solve all previous year questions and topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. If you are a fast reader, you can use rapid revision notes instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Volatile/Giant Subjects
*   Allocate time for subjects like Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   These are volatile subjects that are hard to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   For these, go back to basics: LRR videos and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   Do not read main videos or rapid revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   For subjects like Pharmacology and Microbiology, approach them with the mindset that you only need to manage them for the exam and will never study them again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. Don't think about enjoying the study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>; it's a survival mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
*   If you find a subject like Pharmacology too difficult, at least do its 4-hour LRR and 150-200 previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. This ensures you can solve 7-8 questions out of 15, which is better than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
*   No one knows these volatile subjects very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

### Clinical Subjects
*   Allocate remaining days for clinical subjects like Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Pathology, and Physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   For these, focus only on previous year topics and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule

Divide your day into four time slots for the next nine days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>:
1.  **Study Pattern (Theory and MCQs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>:
    *   Aim for a minimum of 12-14 productive hours of study daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
    *   Divide study time into 60% MCQs and 40% theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Theory happens simultaneously when reviewing MCQ explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, and also from LRR PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
    *   If you can complete your daily targets in fewer hours (e.g., 8-9 hours) because you are a fast reader, that is an advantage; don't feel pressured to study for 12 hours just because others are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
2.  **Images (1 hour)**: At the end of the day, before sleeping, quickly scan all images related to the subjects you studied that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
3.  **Sanity Break (30 minutes)**:
    *   Dedicate 30 minutes daily for personal sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
    *   Ideally, engage in an outdoor activity like a light walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
    *   Keep your phone and books aside during this time to avoid distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. This break helps prevent mental exhaustion and makes life feel more normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   **Increase focus duration**: The Pomodoro technique (20 min study, 10 min break) is not applicable now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch without distractions, mimicking exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.

## Exam Day Approach

*   **Expect one paper to be super easy and one super tough** in the FMGE exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. Don't let a tough Paper 1 demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.
*   During the break between papers, **do not discuss Paper 1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. Jump into Paper 2 without the backlog or hangover of Paper 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   Your overall goal is to cross 150 marks by combining both papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

## Additional Tips
*   If you're already scoring 170-190+ in Grand Tests, **do not change your strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. Continue what is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.
*   For the last day before the exam, focus on **volatile and weak subjects** that you tend to forget quickly (e.g., Biochemistry cycles, Microbiology catalysts, nerve supplies, pharmacology drugs, PSM schemes, biostatistics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Quickly scan them once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   Focus on your daily targets and completing them, rather than the number of hours studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
*   Work in small "boxes" – focus on what to study for the next three hours, then take a short break, and plan for the next three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. Don't think about what your condition will be like in five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.
*   Quick revision methods include focusing on highlighted words and image-based revision, which can cover a subject in 50-60 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.

> [!TIP] The speaker plans to provide daily "OTD" (Topic of the Day) with 2-3 small, important topics for Pathology and Microbiology, suggesting revision from RR or LRR within approximately 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. There will also be a recorded session of top 50 Path and top 50 Micro images for ultra-rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

Balancing intense study schedules with personal well-being is crucial for [[medical_exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation]]. While students often feel a "little bit of tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> about upcoming exams, it's important to manage this stress and prioritize health.

## Understanding Study Hours and Efficiency
While a target of at least 10 to 12 effective hours of study per day is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, it's acknowledged that "thought process anxiety panic time waste by roaming around social media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> can reduce actual productive time. It's realistic to expect about two hours of wasted time due to distractions like social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Managing Anxiety and Stress
The journey of exam preparation often involves [[handling_examrelated_anxiety_and_stress | anxiety and stress]]. It's common to feel overwhelmed or doubt one's abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

### Normalization of Forgetting
A common concern is forgetting information. It's a natural human tendency to forget, and even experienced faculty sometimes forget information if they don't teach for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.
> "Tendency to forget, read again, forget again. Re-read It's a cycle where you will go on till the exam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
Students are advised to "make peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a> with the fact that not everything will stay in their mind forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. Accepting this "human thing to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a> can reduce pressure.

### Physical Health Practices
Maintaining physical health is simpler than it seems. Only 30 to 40 minutes of dedicated time per day is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. This can include:
*   **Short walks**: Incorporated during breaks, even a "fifteen minutes ka tea break converted into 45 minutes ka chit chat break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a> could be used for a walk, which helps physical and [[handling_examrelated_anxiety_and_stress | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
*   **Basic habits**: Deep breathing, drinking water, and a balanced diet are fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

### Mental Health Strategies
[[techniques_for_maintaining_positivity_and_focus_during_exam_preparation | Mental health]] approaches are individual, as "everyone has a different stress buster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. Some suggestions include:
*   **Mindfulness**: 10 to 15 minutes of meditation or yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.
*   **Maintaining emotional balance**: The main aim is to keep your heart rate normal and avoid tachyc<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>ardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.
*   **Positive self-talk**: Instead of calling yourself "useless" or having an "empty brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, acknowledge your achievements like clearing previous exams and reaching this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.
*   **Avoiding negativity**: "Negativity is like a black hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a> that pulls you in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Avoid friends who spread discouraging rumors about exam patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. Your positivity should act as a shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **Internal motivation**: External motivation is short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. The dedication comes from within, by focusing on changing your life after the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.
*   **Focus on the present**: Don't worry about outcomes or unexpected issues on exam day (e.g., computer mouse not working, tire puncture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. Focus on the work for today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.
*   **Adequate sleep**: A minimum of six hours of sleep is necessary for healthy mental functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. If you can function effectively and feel rested, that's an adequate amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Maintaining Momentum
If you feel like "nothing is happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a> or "nothing comes to mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>, it's okay. Assume everyone is starting from zero and aim to reach a passing score from that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. Students have cleared FMG exams by studying diligently in the last 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. [[handling_setbacks_and_maintaining_motivation_in_exam_preparation | Your dedication]] to follow the timetable is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to finish the exam chapter of your life and move on to other challenges and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Visualize your success and keep that dream in front of your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

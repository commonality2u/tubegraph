*Streptococcus* is a genus of bacteria broadly classified based on their hemolytic properties on blood agar [00:34:41]. Different species exhibit varying degrees of red blood cell lysis, which can be partial (alpha), complete (beta), or none (gamma) [00:35:01].

## Classification by Hemolysis

### Alpha-Hemolysis
Alpha-hemolysis is characterized by partial breakdown of blood, resulting in a greenish discoloration around the colonies on blood agar [00:35:27].
Two key organisms in this category are:

*   **Streptococcus viridans** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>
    *   **Characteristics**: Typically seen in chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.
    *   **Biochemical Reactions**: [[Characteristics of specific bacterial cultures | Optochin resistant]] and bile insoluble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
    *   **Clinical Significance**: Known for causing endocarditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>.

*   **Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>
    *   **Characteristics**: Lanceolate or lens-shaped with a capsule [00:54:12]. The capsule is composed of capsular polysaccharide, which allows for typing into over 90 subtypes [00:55:25]. Colonies on culture media can exhibit a "drotzman" or "carom coin" appearance, which is elevated at the periphery and depressed in the center [00:54:33].
    *   **Biochemical Reactions**: [[Characteristics of specific bacterial cultures | Optochin sensitive]] and bile soluble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.
    *   **Clinical Significance**: Primarily causes pneumonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. It is also a common cause of infection in asplenic patients, alongside *H. influenza* and *Meningococcus*, due to its capsule, which the spleen helps to fight [00:59:00].
    *   **Identification Tests**: The Quellung reaction (capsular swelling) is a famous test for capsulated organisms like *S. pneumoniae*, where the capsule swells upon adding anti-capsular antibody [00:56:01].

### Beta-Hemolysis
Beta-hemolysis involves complete breakdown of blood, resulting in a yellowish discoloration around the colonies on blood agar [00:35:25]. Beta-hemolytic streptococci are further classified by the Lancefield classification system [00:36:52].

*   **Lancefield Classification**: This classification divides streptococci into groups (e.g., Group A, Group B, Group C) based on the carbohydrate antigen present in their cell wall [00:37:35]. It is specifically used for beta-hemolytic streptococci and not for alpha-hemolytic *Streptococcus viridans* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

*   **Group A Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>
    *   **Characteristics**: Appear as gram-positive cocci in chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. Transport media for *S. pyogenes* is Pikes media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. Colonies are pinpoint, surrounded by a very wide zone of hemolysis on blood agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
    *   **Biochemical Reactions**: Catalase negative [00:41:30], bacitracin sensitive [00:41:36], and PYR test positive [00:41:45].
    *   **Clinical Significance**: A common cause of sore throat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a> and rheumatic heart disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

*   **Group B Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>
    *   **Clinical Significance**: Can affect neonates, causing meningitis and pneumonia, and also infects older children and adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.
    *   **Biochemical Reactions**: [[Camp Test and Streptococcus Agalactiae in Microbiology | CAMP test]] positive and hippurate hydrolysis positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
        *   The [[Camp Test and Streptococcus Agalactiae in Microbiology | CAMP test]] is performed on a blood agar by streaking *Staphylococcus aureus* vertically and the patient's sample (e.g., *S. agalactiae*) perpendicularly. A positive result is indicated by the formation of an arrowhead at the junction of the two streaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

### Gamma-Hemolysis
Gamma-hemolysis (also known as non-hemolytic) means there is no breakdown of blood and no color change around the colonies on blood agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

*   **Enterococcus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>
    *   **Characteristics**: Appear as spectacle-shaped gram-positive cocci [00:49:53]. They are non-motile and non-hemolytic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>. They can grow in 6.5% NaCl and are tolerant to heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>. They also grow in the presence of 40% bile, and on Bile Esculin Azide (BEA) agar, they produce a black color [00:51:01].
    *   **Biochemical Reactions**: PYR test positive [00:51:26].
    *   **Clinical Significance**: Classified as Group D streptococci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

## Differentiation of Streptococcus from Staphylococcus

*   **Gram Stain**: Both *Streptococcus* and *Staphylococcus* are gram-positive cocci (purple color) [00:20:47]. However, *Staphylococcus* typically arranges in "bunch of grapes" clusters, while *Streptococcus* forms chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
*   **Catalase Test**: *Staphylococcus* is catalase positive, producing bubbles when hydrogen peroxide is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. In contrast, *Streptococcus* is catalase negative, showing no bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   **Coagulase Test**: *Staphylococcus aureus* is coagulase positive, while Coagulase-Negative *Staphylococcus* (CoNS) species like *Staphylococcus epidermidis* and *Staphylococcus saprophyticus* are coagulase negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This test is primarily for *Staphylococcus* and not generally applied to *Streptococcus*.

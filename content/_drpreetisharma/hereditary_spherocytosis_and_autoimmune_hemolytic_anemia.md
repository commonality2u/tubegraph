Spherocytes are red blood cells that appear "entirely spherical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. When a spherocyte is observed on a blood film, the most common cause is not [[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | hereditary spherocytosis]], but rather [[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)

### Characteristics and Diagnosis
AIHA is a condition where the body's immune system produces antibodies that attack red blood cells, leading to their destruction and the formation of spherocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

If only a spherocyte image is presented without additional clinical context or family history, [[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | AIHA]] should be considered the primary diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The key diagnostic test for [[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | AIHA]] is the Coombs test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS)

### Characteristics and Diagnosis
[[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | Hereditary spherocytosis]] should be suspected when a patient presents with jaundice (indicating blood breakdown), splenomegaly (enlarged spleen breaking down red blood cells), and a classical family history of similar complaints, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. If a family history is provided alongside a spherocyte image, [[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | HS]] is the likely diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Diagnostic Tests
*   **Osmotic Fragility Testing:** In earlier days, this was used as a screening test for [[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | HS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **EMA Test (Eosin 5 Malamatide):** This is the confirmatory test for [[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | hereditary spherocytosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. It is a type of stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Genetic Basis
The most common mutation associated with [[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | hereditary spherocytosis]], particularly in autosomal dominant cases, is a mutation in the Ankyrin gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

*Note: If neither [[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | AIHA]] nor [[distinguishing_types_of_anemia_and_their_causes | HS]] are indicated, other conditions like G6PD deficiency anemia might be considered, for which G6PD levels in the blood are measured using an Eliza machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.*

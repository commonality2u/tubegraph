Spherocytes are red blood cells that are entirely spherical in shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. When a spherocyte is observed on a peripheral smear, the most common cause is not hereditary spherocytosis, but rather [[General Pathology and Immunology Topics | autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] (AIHA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)
When spherocytes are seen, especially in a primigravida, AIHA is the primary consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis**: The diagnostic test for AIHA is a Coombs test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS)
Hereditary spherocytosis is considered when spherocytes are present alongside a classical family history, indicating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Clinical Features
Patients may present with:
*   Jaundice, indicating red blood cell breakdown and increased bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Splenomegaly, suggesting the spleen is actively breaking down red blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Family history of similar complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Diagnosis
*   **Screening Test**: In earlier days, osmotic fragility testing was performed as a screening test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Confirmatory Test**: The confirmatory test for HS is the EMA (eosin-5-maleimide) test, which involves adding a stain to identify spherocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Genetic Basis
*   **Most Common Mutation**: The most common mutation associated with autosomal dominant hereditary spherocytosis is in the Ankyrin gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Differentiating AIHA and HS
*   If only a spherocyte image is given, consider AIHA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   If a family history is provided with the image, consider hereditary spherocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

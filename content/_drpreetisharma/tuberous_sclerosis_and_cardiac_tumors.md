Tuberous sclerosis is a syndrome characterized by the correlation between cardiac tumors and intellectual disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, specifically the cardiac tumor rhabdomyoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:02">[04:20:02]</a>.

## Genetic Basis
Tuberous sclerosis is linked to mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **TSC1 gene**: Located on chromosome 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a> and codes for the protein Hamartin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **TSC2 gene**: Located on chromosome 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a> and codes for the protein Tuberin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations
Tuberous sclerosis manifests with various findings across multiple organ systems:
*   **Dermatology**:
    *   Ash-leaf spot: Hypopigmented lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
    *   Shagreen patch: Thick, leathery skin appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
    *   Angiofibroma: Seen on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.
*   **Cardiac**: Rhabdomyoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   **Lungs**: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>, which involves lymphatic channels, blood vessels, and smooth muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   **Brain**:
    *   Epilepsy due to cortical tubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
    *   Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA), a type of [[brain_tumor | CNS tumor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>, explaining intellectual disability and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. This tumor type is relevant for [[identification_and_characteristics_of_brain_tumors | identification of brain tumors]] in this context.
*   **Kidney**: Angiomyolipoma (AML) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, which is not a leukemia but a tumor of muscle and fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## Pathological Characteristics of Associated Tumors
All the tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis, such as rhabdomyoma, LAM, and AML, are classified as hamartomatous tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. This means they are overgrowths of mature cells that are normally found in the affected tissue, but are disorganized. For instance, rhabdomyoma, a skeletal muscle tumor, occurs in the cardiac muscle of the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Cardiac Tumors in Detail
*   **Most Common Cardiac Tumor in Children**: Rhabdomyoma is the most likely cardiac tumor in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
    *   **Histology**: Characterized by the presence of "spider cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>. These cells appear white due to glycogen content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a> and are PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Malignant Counterpart in Children**: Rhabdomyosarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. Desmin and MyoD1 are better markers for rhabdomyosarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.

*   **Other Primary Cardiac Tumors**:
    *   **Most common primary cardiac tumor in Adults (Benign)**: Myxoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
        *   **Location**: Typically occurs in the left atrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.
        *   **Gross Appearance**: Appears as a jelly-like mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.
        *   **Histology**: Contains "lepidic cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.
        *   **Malignant Counterpart in Adults**: Angiosarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Most Common Cardiac Valvular Tumor**: Papillary Fibroelastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>, often described as a sea anemone-like structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

*   **Metastatic Cardiac Tumors**: The most common overall cardiac malignancy is secondary metastatic disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

## Related Cardiac Conditions:
*   **Myosin Heavy Chain Mutation**: Associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:08]</a>. HCM typically presents with a "banana-shaped heart" and a disarray or "helter-skelter" arrangement of cardiac muscle fibers on histopathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>.
*   **[[dilated_cardiomyopathy_and_genetic_mutations | Dilated Cardiomyopathy]] (DCM)**:
    *   **Genetic Alteration**: Most commonly associated with Titan mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. Titan is one of the largest proteins in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Pathology**: All four heart chambers are typically dilated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Histology**: May show a "ninja star appearance" of the nucleus in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Causes**: Alcohol is a very common cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>.
*   **Dystrophin Gene**: Associated with muscular dystrophies like Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.
*   **Plecoglobin Gene**: Associated with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Histology**: Characterized by fatty infiltration of the right ventricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Associated Syndrome**: Naxos syndrome, which includes ARVC, woolly hair, and keratoderma (thick palms and soles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>.
*   **Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)**: Also known as floppy valve syndrome or Barlow syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>. It is often an asymptomatic incidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a> and on microscopic examination shows myxomatous degeneration of the valve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:00">[28:02:00]</a>.

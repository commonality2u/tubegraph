[[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Tests]] (GTs) are crucial tools for exam preparation, serving as a guide to assess your progress and identify areas for improvement, rather than merely a measure of marks obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

## Frequency and Timing of Grand Tests

For students not yet comfortable with their syllabus, starting with three [[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Tests]] over 65 days is a good initial approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. If you are in a more comfortable position with your syllabus, aim to take one [[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Test]] every 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Ideally, giving a GT every Sunday would be excellent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

It is acceptable to focus on reading subjects first and then transition to [[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Tests]] by January, as taking a GT after only studying two subjects might seem illogical at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Instead of immediately taking a full [[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Test]], especially if you fear failure, you can start by making a custom module of 50 mixed questions and completing four such sets in a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. This acts as a GT but without the perceived pressure of the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>. Once you feel comfortable with these smaller tests, then attempt a full [[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

## The Purpose of Grand Tests

[[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Tests]] serve several key purposes beyond just generating a score:
*   **Guidance:** They guide you on which direction to go – left or right – in your [[approach_to_final_exam_preparation | exam preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
*   **Syllabus Adjustment:** They inform you which subjects or topics need more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **Time Management:** GTs are essential for practicing and improving time management during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
*   **Weak Subject Analysis:** They highlight your weaker subjects, allowing you to focus your revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.
*   **Memory Recall:** GTs test your ability to recall information under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

The score is a byproduct of your approach and analysis; focus on refining your approach to the GT, and the score will naturally improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

## Analyzing Grand Tests (GTs)

A critical component of the [[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Test]] process is thorough analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The analysis should be done in layers, ideally on the same day you take the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>:

### Analyzing Incorrect Answers
Start by analyzing all the questions you answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>. This helps identify significant knowledge gaps.

### Analyzing Confused Guesses
Next, review questions where you were confused between options and had to make an intelligent or safe guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. Analyzing these helps refine your decision-making and subject clarity.

### Analyzing Correct Answers
Finally, briefly review the questions you answered correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. Since you got them right, you already know the information. Scan through the explanations quickly without spending too much time, for instance, on well-known facts like Rota virus causing diarrhea in infants or its vaccine side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.

## Common GT Issues and Solutions

If your GT scores are low, there are typically two main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>:
1.  **Problem with Notes/Revision:** Your revision may not be up to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. If you have done main videos, but not revised them, your GT scores will fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
    *   **Solution:** Focus on revising your notes thoroughly or switch to rapid revision videos if you have covered main videos previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.
2.  **Insufficient [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_mcqs | Practice Questions]]:** You are not practicing enough questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.
    *   **Solution:** Increase the number of [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_mcqs | questions]] you solve daily. If you're doing 40 questions, increase to 60 or 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

By identifying the specific problem (notes or practice), you know what to treat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. Keep your [[study_strategies_theory_and_mcq_practice | strategy]] simple: master your notes and then master [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_mcqs | MCQ solving]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

Regularly analyze your GT performance subject-wise to see what you got wrong (factual or clinical) and identify weaker subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. For example, if you miss factual questions, strengthen first and second-year subjects like Microbiology and Pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. If you are strong in clinicals but weak in factual subjects, improving the latter will significantly boost your GT score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.

If you are struggling with [[handling_study_materials_and_question_banks | MCQ management]] or time management, start putting a timer in front of you daily while solving [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_mcqs | MCQs]], aiming to solve each question in 42-45 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

## Overcoming the Fear of GTs

It is common for students to fear [[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Tests]], often due to the fear of failure or feeling overwhelmed after studying notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. To overcome this fear, the best approach is to simply give the GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

It is better to make mistakes and "fail" in your GTs now than to fail in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. You will experience dips in scores, but eventually, an amazing score will come unexpectedly, boosting your confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. Keep your GT scores a secret if you wish, to avoid external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

Avoid making a graph of your GT scores, as this distracts from the real purpose of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. The focus should be on the analysis of mistakes and improvement, not just the numerical score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. Taking free [[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Tests]] offered by various platforms is highly recommended, as they simulate different examiner styles, just like the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

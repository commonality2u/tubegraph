## Esophageal Disorders

### Achalasia Cardia
[[Esophageal disorders and diagnoses | Achalasia cardia]] presents with difficulty in swallowing and a tendency to regurgitate food [00:02:17]. Endoscopy typically does not reveal any gastric or esophageal masses or ulcers [00:02:22], [00:02:44]. Manometric studies show absent peristalsis and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax upon swallowing, along with increased LES pressure [00:02:25], [00:02:39]. Barium studies can reveal a "Bird's Beak Appearance" due to the non-relaxing LES [00:03:09], [00:03:16].

Most cases of [[Esophageal disorders and diagnoses | achalasia cardia]] are idiopathic [00:03:25]. However, when an infectious cause is identified, it is commonly associated with *Trypanosoma cruzi*, the causative agent of Chagas disease [00:03:30], [00:03:43], [00:03:54]. Herpes can also cause [[Esophageal disorders and diagnoses | achalasia cardia]], but *Trypanosoma cruzi* is considered the single best answer [00:03:33], [00:03:41]. In Chagas disease, the esophagus and colon can become greatly dilated, leading to megaesophagus and megacolon, due to obstruction and constraint at the lower end [00:04:00], [00:04:06], [00:04:16], [00:04:18].

### Plummer-Vinson Syndrome
[[Esophageal disorders and diagnoses | Plummer-Vinson Syndrome]], also known as Paterson-Brown-Kelly Syndrome or Sideropenic Dysphagia, is characterized by a triad of iron deficiency anemia, dysphagia, and esophageal webs [00:05:12], [00:05:15], [00:05:23], [00:05:37], [00:05:50]. Esophageal webs are constrictions without inflammation or cancer [00:05:59], [00:06:01], [00:06:06]. A complication of [[Esophageal disorders and diagnoses | Plummer-Vinson Syndrome]] is an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [00:06:44], [00:06:47].

## Stomach and Gastrointestinal Disorders

### Linitis Plastica (Diffuse Gastric Cancer)
[[Stomach and gastrointestinal tumors | Linitis Plastica]], or "leather bottle stomach," is a diffuse gastric cancer where the tumor infiltrates the wall of the stomach, making it very hard and non-compressible, rather than forming a visible growth [00:15:40], [00:15:47], [00:16:01], [00:16:08], [00:16:12], [00:16:21]. Pathologically, it is known as diffuse gastric cancer [00:16:35], [00:16:38].

The characteristic cells seen in [[Stomach and gastrointestinal tumors | Linitis Plastica]] are signet ring cells [00:16:50]. These cells have their nucleus pushed to the side by abundant intracellular mucin [00:16:58], [00:17:02], [00:17:10], [00:17:20], [00:17:25]. Any tumor containing mucin can exhibit signet ring cells [00:17:42]. For example, the Krukenberg tumor of the ovary also shows signet ring cells due to mucin content [00:17:55], [00:18:00].

The most likely genetic alteration associated with diffuse gastric cancer is a mutation in the CDH1 gene, which encodes for E-cadherin [00:18:31], [00:18:34], [00:18:43]. E-cadherin acts as a cell adhesion molecule, a "glue" holding cells together [00:18:56], [00:19:00], [00:19:08]. When the CDH1 gene is mutated, this "glue" is lost, allowing for diffuse tumor spread [00:19:14], [00:19:17], [00:19:27]. This mutation is also seen in invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast, which classically presents with an "Indian file pattern" due to loss of cell adhesion [00:19:38], [00:4:00], [00:20:06].

### Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
A [[Stomach and gastrointestinal tumors | Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)]] is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the stomach [00:21:21], [00:21:24]. It is characterized by spindle cells on biopsy [00:20:38], [00:20:40], [00:20:51], [00:21:06]. GISTs can occur in both the stomach and intestines, but are more common in the stomach [00:21:49], [00:21:54].

GISTs arise from the cells of Cajal, which are the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract [00:22:08], [00:22:10], [00:22:14], [00:22:16]. The most common mutation associated with GIST is CD117 (c-KIT) [00:22:31], [00:22:33]. Other less common mutations include PDGFR (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor) and Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) [00:22:48], [00:22:52]. SDH mutations are specifically associated with pediatric GIST [00:22:54], [00:23:12], [00:23:14]. CD117 is also a sensitive marker for GIST [00:23:19], [00:23:22]. DOG1 is a specific marker for GIST [00:23:29]. CD34 can also be positive in GIST [00:23:43], [00:23:46].

### Bezoars
A bezoar is a mass found trapped in the gastrointestinal system [02:50:50]. A trichobezoar is a mass composed of hair, often associated with a condition called Rapunzel Syndrome, typically seen in girls with very long hair who tend to eat it [00:25:22], [00:25:35], [00:25:53], [00:26:07], [00:26:10]. A phytobezoar is composed of plant products [00:25:47].

## Intestinal Polyps

### Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome
[[Genetic disorders and syndromes related to pathology | Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome]] is characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation (dark spots on skin and mucous membranes) and hamartomatous polyps [00:26:40], [00:27:02], [00:27:05], [00:27:15], [00:27:27], [00:27:42]. The polyps are most commonly seen in the jejunum [00:27:35]. Hamartomas are benign growths composed of a disorganized mixture of normal tissue elements, in this case, smooth muscle bands within the gastrointestinal tract, giving them a "Christmas tree" or "arborizing" appearance [00:27:56], [00:27:59], [00:28:07], [00:28:13], [00:28:20], [00:28:26], [00:28:31], [00:28:37], [00:29:04], [00:29:09], [00:29:14]. Mason's trichrome stain can be used to differentiate between muscle (stains red) and collagen (stains blue) [00:30:09], [00:30:12], [00:30:20], [00:30:26], [00:30:32], [00:30:37], [00:30:42].

### Colorectal Polyps
Colorectal polyps can be broadly classified. [[Specific diseases and their presentations Diagnosis and treatment | Hyperplastic polyps]] are non-malignant and do not have premalignant potential [00:32:42], [00:32:45], [00:32:47], [00:34:29], [00:34:36]. Histologically, they show hyperplastic goblet cells and crypt architecture with serrations (zigzag foldings) predominantly in the upper part of the crypts [00:31:39], [00:31:42], [00:32:29], [00:32:32], [00:33:02], [00:33:04], [00:33:06], [00:33:10], [00:33:27], [00:33:33], [00:33:41], [00:33:49], [00:33:53], [00:34:03], [00:34:10], [00:34:15].

In contrast, a [[Specific diseases and their presentations Diagnosis and treatment | sessile serrated adenoma]] shows serrations throughout the full thickness of the crypt, from top to bottom [00:34:40], [00:34:43], [00:34:48], [00:34:55]. This distinction is crucial because [[Specific diseases and their presentations Diagnosis and treatment | sessile serrated adenomas]] *are* considered premalignant [00:35:04], [00:35:08], [00:35:27], [00:35:29].

## Liver Disorders and Diseases

### Cholestatic Liver Diseases

#### Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)
[[primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_and_liver_pathologies | Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)]] is characterized by jaundice, dark urine, and recurrent fever [00:35:45], [00:35:48], [00:36:01]. Imaging (ERCP) shows a "beaded appearance" of the extrahepatic biliary tree due to multifocal strictures and dilatations [00:36:07], [00:36:11], [00:36:33], [00:36:38], [00:36:45], [00:37:29]. Histologically, PSC exhibits "onion skin fibrosis" around bile ducts, which is a periductal concentric fibrosis [00:36:58], [00:37:04], [00:37:11], [00:37:15], [00:37:32], [00:37:37], [00:37:42], [00:39:41].

[[primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_and_liver_pathologies | PSC]] is associated with the P-ANCA antibody [00:37:50], [00:37:52], [00:39:13], [00:39:15]. It is more common in males ("papa") and is frequently associated with [[Specific diseases and their presentations Diagnosis and treatment | ulcerative colitis]] [00:37:57], [00:38:00], [00:39:17], [00:39:20], [00:39:22], [01:23:39], [01:23:41]. PSC typically affects younger patients (around 30 years old) and involves both intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts [00:38:40], [00:38:48], [00:39:33], [00:39:36].

#### Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)
[[primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_and_liver_pathologies | Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)]], formerly known as Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, is more common in older females ("amma") [00:38:40], [00:38:45], [00:39:05], [00:39:08], [00:39:24], [00:39:26]. It is associated with Anti-Mitochondrial Antibodies (AMA), which are directed against the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH-E2) [00:38:56], [00:38:58], [00:39:02], [00:39:50], [00:39:52].

### Inherited Bilirubin Disorders

#### Dubin-Johnson Syndrome
[[Specific diseases and their presentations Diagnosis and treatment | Dubin-Johnson Syndrome]] is an inherited disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, leading to yellow skin and sclera, and dark urine [00:42:54], [00:42:57], [00:43:05], [00:43:08], [00:44:19], [00:44:21], [00:44:42]. It is often asymptomatic except during periods of stress [00:43:37], [00:43:40], [00:43:49], [00:43:51], [00:43:54], [00:43:57], [00:44:09]. The hallmark of [[Specific diseases and their presentations Diagnosis and treatment | Dubin-Johnson Syndrome]] is a dark, pigmented liver due to impaired excretion of conjugated bilirubin and accumulation of melanin-like pigment in hepatocytes [00:45:09], [00:45:12], [00:45:14], [00:45:16], [00:45:19], [00:45:22], [00:45:26], [00:45:34], [00:45:36], [00:45:38]. It is caused by a defect in the MRP2 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2) gene [00:45:52].

#### Rotor Syndrome
[[Specific diseases and their presentations Diagnosis and treatment | Rotor Syndrome]] also presents with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia but, unlike Dubin-Johnson, the liver is not pigmented [00:44:58], [00:45:01], [00:45:31], [00:45:34].

#### Gilbert's Syndrome
[[Specific diseases and their presentations Diagnosis and treatment | Gilbert's Syndrome]] is characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia [00:44:12], [00:44:15], [00:44:17]. Like Dubin-Johnson, it is often asymptomatic until triggered by stress (e.g., fever) [00:43:54], [00:43:57], [00:43:59], [00:44:02], [00:44:04], [00:44:07], [00:44:09], [00:44:11].

### Autoimmune Liver Conditions

#### Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia
[[Autoimmune hepatitis and diagnostic challenges | Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia]] is characterized by severe anemia and unconjugated jaundice due to the breakdown of red blood cells [00:46:06], [00:46:10], [00:46:14], [00:46:17], [00:46:45], [00:46:48], [00:46:51], [00:46:54], [00:46:57], [00:47:01]. It is an antibody-mediated disorder that typically responds to corticosteroids [00:47:28], [00:47:30], [00:47:32], [00:47:34], [00:47:36], [00:47:38], [00:47:40], [00:47:42], [00:47:44], [00:47:46], [00:47:48], [00:47:50].

#### Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH)
[[Autoimmune hepatitis and diagnostic challenges | Autoimmune Hepatitis]] is a diagnosis made when viral hepatitis markers and anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are negative, and liver biopsy shows characteristic findings [00:56:51], [00:56:53], [00:56:55], [00:56:58], [00:57:00], [00:57:03]. It responds well to steroids [00:57:21], [00:57:24], [00:57:27], [00:57:29], [00:57:31], [00:57:34].

Histological features of [[Autoimmune hepatitis and diagnostic challenges | autoimmune hepatitis]] include:
*   **Interface Hepatitis:** Lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrate the interface between the portal triad and the liver parenchyma [00:58:07], [00:58:11], [00:58:13], [00:58:16], [00:58:18], [00:58:21], [00:58:23], [00:58:25], [00:58:28], [00:58:30], [00:58:33], [00:58:36], [00:58:40], [00:58:44], [00:58:47], [00:58:51], [00:58:55], [00:58:58], [00:59:02], [00:59:05], [00:59:08], [00:59:11], [00:59:13], [00:59:16].
*   **Emperipolesis:** Large cells (hepatocytes) engulf smaller cells (often lymphocytes or plasma cells) [00:59:36], [00:59:39], [00:59:41], [00:59:43], [00:59:47], [00:59:49], [00:59:51], [00:59:54].
*   **Hepatic Rosettes:** Hepatocytes form rosette-like structures (cells present in sheets trying to take a round structure) [01:00:03], [01:00:07], [01:00:09], [01:00:11], [01:00:14], [01:00:17], [01:00:20], [01:00:22], [01:00:25], [01:00:27].

[[Autoimmune hepatitis and diagnostic challenges | Autoimmune hepatitis]] is classified into types based on antibody profiles:
*   **Type 1 AIH:** Associated with Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANA), Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibodies (ASMA), and Soluble Liver Antigen (SLA) antibodies [01:03:07], [01:03:10], [01:03:12], [01:03:16], [01:03:18], [01:03:22], [01:04:21], [01:04:23], [01:04:27].
*   **Type 2 AIH:** Associated with Anti-Liver Kidney Microsomal antibodies (Anti-LKM), specifically Anti-LKM Type 1 and Type 2 [01:01:53], [01:01:55], [01:01:59], [01:02:01], [01:02:04], [01:02:07], [01:02:10], [01:02:13], [01:02:25], [01:02:32], [01:02:34], [01:02:37], [01:02:39], [01:03:00], [01:03:02], [01:04:33], [01:04:36], [01:04:41].
    *   Drug-induced [[Autoimmune hepatitis and diagnostic challenges | autoimmune hepatitis]] typically falls under Type 2 AIH and is associated with Anti-LKM Type 2 antibodies [01:01:43], [01:01:46], [01:01:49], [01:01:50], [01:02:10], [01:02:22], [01:02:25], [01:02:27], [01:02:30], [01:03:00].
*   Anti-LKM Type 3 antibodies are associated with [[Infectious disease case studies and treatments | Hepatitis C]] and [[Infectious disease case studies and treatments | Hepatitis D]] [01:03:50], [01:03:53], [01:03:55], [01:03:58], [01:04:44], [01:04:49].
*   Type 3 AIH is also associated with SLA antibodies [01:04:06].

### Viral Hepatitis

#### Hepatitis B
[[Infectious disease case studies and treatments | Hepatitis B]] serology involves testing for antigens (HBsAg, HBeAg) and antibodies (anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HBe) [00:49:09], [00:49:11], [00:49:13], [00:49:17], [00:49:19], [00:49:23], [00:49:27], [00:49:30], [00:49:37], [00:49:49], [00:49:52], [00:49:56], [00:50:02], [00:50:04], [00:50:08], [00:50:10]. The core antigen (HBcAg) does not circulate in the blood [00:49:27], [00:49:30].

*   **Acute Hepatitis B:** Characterized by positive HBsAg, HBeAg (indicating high infectivity), and IgM anti-HBc [00:51:24], [00:51:28], [00:51:31], [00:51:34], [00:51:37], [00:51:43], [00:51:45], [00:51:50], [00:51:52], [00:51:55]. Low infectivity is indicated by negative HBeAg [00:51:57].
*   **Chronic Hepatitis B:** Characterized by positive HBsAg, HBeAg (high infectivity) or negative HBeAg (low infectivity), and IgG anti-HBc [00:52:12], [00:52:15], [00:52:17], [00:52:20], [00:52:23], [00:52:26], [00:52:29], [00:52:32], [00:52:36], [00:53:00], [00:53:02].

Liver biopsy is typically not performed for acute hepatitis (e.g., Hepatitis A, acute Hepatitis B) but is often used to assess chronic cases [00:54:03], [00:54:05], [00:54:07], [00:54:09], [00:54:11], [00:54:17], [00:54:19], [00:54:21], [00:54:23], [00:54:25], [00:54:27]. Histological findings in chronic [[Infectious disease case studies and treatments | Hepatitis B]] can include nodule formation, resembling cirrhosis [00:53:17], [00:53:20], [00:53:23], [00:53:26], [00:53:29], [00:53:32], [00:53:35], [00:53:39], [00:53:43], [00:53:47], [00:53:49], [00:53:51], [00:53:55], [00:53:58].

[[Infectious disease case studies and treatments | Hepatitis B]] can be associated with [[Cardiovascular system diseases and diagnosis | Polyarteritis Nodosa]], a vascular disorder [00:56:00], [00:56:02], [00:56:05], [00:56:07], [00:56:10], [00:56:13].

Other histological findings related to hepatitis:
*   **Ground Glass Hepatocytes:** Seen in [[Infectious disease case studies and treatments | Hepatitis B]] [00:54:38], [00:54:41], [00:54:42], [00:55:03], [00:55:07], [00:55:09], [00:55:40], [01:19:14], [01:22:13], [01:22:16].
*   **Prominent Lymphocytic Infiltrates:** Seen in [[Infectious disease case studies and treatments | Hepatitis C]] [00:54:52], [00:54:55], [00:55:12], [00:55:14], [01:22:08].
*   **Councilman Bodies:** Can be seen in most viral hepatitides, but if one must be selected, [[Infectious disease case studies and treatments | Hepatitis C]] is often chosen [01:20:41], [01:20:44], [01:20:47], [01:20:50], [01:20:52], [01:22:08], [01:22:10].

### Genetic Metabolic Liver Disorders

#### Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
[[Genetic disorders and syndromes related to pathology | Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency]] is a genetic disorder affecting the liver and lungs. In the liver, it causes accumulation of misfolded alpha-1 antitrypsin protein, which stains PAS positive and is diastase resistant [01:07:01], [01:07:03], [01:07:07], [01:10:37].

#### Glycogen Storage Diseases
[[Genetic disorders and syndromes related to pathology | Glycogen storage diseases]] are characterized by the accumulation of glycogen in tissues. Glycogen stains PAS positive and is diastase sensitive (meaning the pink color disappears after diastase digestion because the enzyme breaks down glycogen) [01:06:57], [01:07:01], [01:07:54], [01:07:55], [01:07:58], [01:08:00], [01:08:03], [01:08:05], [01:08:08], [01:08:11], [01:08:13], [01:08:16], [01:08:19], [01:08:22], [01:08:25], [01:08:28], [01:08:32], [01:08:35], [01:08:38], [01:08:42], [01:08:45], [01:08:47], [01:09:02], [01:09:05], [01:10:20], [01:10:22], [01:10:26], [01:11:26], [01:11:29].

Ewing Sarcoma and Dysgerminoma/Seminoma are also PAS positive and diastase sensitive because they contain glycogen [01:11:08], [01:11:10], [01:11:13], [01:11:15], [01:11:32], [01:11:34], [01:11:35], [01:11:37], [01:12:00], [01:12:22], [01:12:32], [01:12:34], [01:13:03], [01:13:06], [01:13:08], [01:13:11], [01:13:13], [01:13:15], [01:13:17], [01:13:19], [01:13:21], [01:13:23], [01:13:25], [01:13:27], [01:13:30], [01:13:32], [01:13:35], [01:13:38], [01:13:41], [01:13:44], [01:13:46], [01:13:48].

#### Wilson's Disease
[[Genetic disorders and syndromes related to pathology | Wilson's Disease]] is a genetic disorder of copper overload. PAS stain is not used for its diagnosis [01:06:49], [01:06:51], [01:06:52], [01:06:54].

#### Hereditary Hemochromatosis
[[Genetic disorders and syndromes related to pathology | Hereditary Hemochromatosis]] is a genetic disorder of iron overload. Pearl's stain (Prussian blue) is used for iron detection, not PAS stain [01:06:41], [01:06:45], [01:06:47].

## Other PAS Positive Materials/Conditions
The Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain is used to detect various substances. PAS positive materials include:
*   Alpha-1 Antitrypsin [01:10:37]
*   Amyloid [01:10:40]
*   Basement Membranes (e.g., in kidney in diabetic nephropathy - Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions) [01:10:43], [01:10:45], [01:10:50], [01:10:53], [01:11:03], [01:12:13], [01:12:16].
*   Colloid in thyroid [01:10:47]
*   *Ewing Sarcoma* (due to glycogen) [01:11:08], [01:11:10], [01:11:13], [01:11:15], [01:12:22].

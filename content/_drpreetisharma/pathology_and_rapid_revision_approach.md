The "Weekly Wednesday Wisdom" sessions are designed to guide students through the [[review_of_pathology_slides_and_exams | Pathology]] syllabus using a rapid revision approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These sessions occur every Wednesday at 11 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. A timetable is provided for the ongoing schedule, with plans to release further schedules in continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Study Plan Using Rapid Revision

The recommended study plan for these sessions involves a three-step process:

1.  **Pre-Session Reading**: Students should read the assigned chapter from either [[utilizing_rapid_revision_versus_main_videos_for_preparation | main videos]] or [[effectiveness_of_rapid_revision_videos_for_exam_preparation | Rapid Revision (RR)]] material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
2.  **Attend Live Session**: Participate in the live session at 11 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **Post-Session Review**: After the session, spend approximately 30 minutes quickly reviewing the discussed topic, especially focusing on its [[pathology_image_review | images]] portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Pathology Image Review

For [[pathology_image_review | image]] review, students following "Prep Ladder" or similar apps should note that images are present at the end of the [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | Rapid Revision]] content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. There is a specific five-hour dedicated [[pathology_image_revision_for_fmg_exam | Pathology Image Revision]] session available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Syllabus Coverage

The weekly schedule aims to finish major [[pathology_concepts_and_mixed_practice_questions | Pathology concepts]] before the May IAI CET Exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

*   **Systems Pathology**: Systems are covered first to encourage concurrent revision of Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | Rapid Revision]] for [[pathology_concepts_and_mixed_practice_questions | Pathology]] is considered sufficient alongside standard resources like "First Aid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **[[bacteriology_revision_strategies | Bacteriology]] and Virology**: These topics are covered after systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **General Pathology and Hematology**: Revision of these topics is scheduled for April and May, particularly important for the IAI CET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Effectiveness of Rapid Revision

For students preparing for NEET PG, FMG, and INI CET exams, especially those with limited time (e.g., May/June/July exams), relying on [[effectiveness_of_rapid_revision_videos_for_exam_preparation | Rapid Revision]] is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. The [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | Rapid Revision]] videos are described as a "mini main video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a> and a "very good summary" of the main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>.

>[!tip] Approach for Pathology & Micro
>For [[pathology_concepts_and_mixed_practice_questions | Pathology]] and Micro, students are advised to:
>- Use [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | rapid revision]] material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.
>- Attend the live sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
>- Attempt questions from a Q-Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.
>This comprehensive approach is considered sufficient for exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

## General Study Advice

*   **Active Learning**: The sessions are designed to be interactive, with questions asked to gauge understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. PDF notes and converted poll questions will be provided for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.
*   **Holistic Study**: When answering questions, it is crucial to consider the full context and related [[pathology_concepts_and_mixed_practice_questions | concepts]], not just keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **Consistent Practice**: Regular attendance and adherence to the study plan are vital for staying on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. Dedicate specific time slots (e.g., 3-4 hours every Monday) to cover the weekly target, allowing for recall assessment later in the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.
*   **Balance Subjects**: Remember that [[pathology_concepts_and_mixed_practice_questions | Pathology]] is just one of many subjects; maintain a balanced study approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.

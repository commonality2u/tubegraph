[[diabetic_nephropathy | Diabetic nephropathy]] is a common complication of uncontrolled diabetes, characterized by specific histological changes in the kidney.

## Clinical Presentation
A 55-year-old female presented for a regular health checkup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Her complete blood count (CBC) showed normal hemoglobin (12), normal total leukocyte count (TLC) of 10,000 (normal range 4,000-11,000), and normal platelet counts of 170,000 (normal range 1.5-4.5 lakhs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

However, her HbA1c was elevated at 11%, indicating uncontrolled diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Urine analysis revealed protein 2+ and glucose 3+, with no casts or crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. A [[renal_pathology_and_conditions | renal biopsy]] was performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Pathological Findings

### Kimmelstiel-Wilson (KW) Lesion
The classical Kimmelstiel-Wilson (KW) lesion is the most characteristic finding in [[diabetic_nephropathy | diabetic nephropathy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. It is technically known as nodular glomerulosclerosis (NGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

*   **Appearance:** This lesion features a sclerotic glomerulus with pinkish material in the form of nodules, meaning the entire glomerulus has not become pink, but distinct nodules are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

### Other Renal Findings in Diabetic Nephropathy
Beyond the KW lesion, other findings in [[diabetic_nephropathy | diabetic nephropathy]] include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>:
*   **Thickening of the glomerular capillary basement membrane** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Hyaline arteriolosclerosis** involving the glomerular arterioles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Armani-Epstein lesion:** Glycogen accumulation in the proximal convoluted tubule, which is *not* a glomerular finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Diffuse glomerulosclerosis:** Sclerosis spread throughout the entire glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Capsular drop:** Pinkish material dropping from Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Fibrin cap:** Pinkish material sitting on the capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Papillary necrosis:** Death of the renal papilla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. Diabetes is the most common cause, but it can also be seen in other conditions (mnemonic "DOSA") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Special Stains for Diagnosis
To better appreciate the nodules of the KW lesion, the Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain is used, as it highlights the pink color of the nodules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

### Other Stains Mentioned
*   **Verhoeff-van Gieson (VG) stain:** Used for staining elastic tissue, e.g., in temporal arteritis or vasculitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Alcian Blue stain:** Used for acidic mucin, such as in Barrett's esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain:** Used for acid-fastness, commonly for tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Blood Sample Collection
*   **CBC:** Collected in a purple vacutainer containing EDTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c):** Also collected in a purple vacutainer with EDTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
    *   *Note:* Other glucose samples (fasting, postprandial, random blood sugar) are collected in a gray vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) testing requires specific anticoagulants to prevent blood clotting and allow for accurate measurement of the sedimentation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Methods and Associated Anticoagulants

ESR can be determined using three primary methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>:

### Manual Methods

These methods are performed manually by a doctor or technician without machine assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

*   **Wintrobe Tube Method**
    *   Blood is collected in an EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   This is typically a purple-colored vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Westergren Pipet Method**
    *   Blood is collected in a light blue vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   This vacutainer contains tricodium citrate as the anticoagulant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Automated Machines

For advanced lab settings, automated machines are used to measure ESR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

*   Blood is collected in a black-colored vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   This vacutainer also contains tricodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The key difference between the light blue and black vacutainers lies in the technique by which the testing is performed, not the anticoagulant, as both use tricodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Other Anticoagulants Mentioned

While tricodium citrate is often considered a primary answer for ESR, other anticoagulants are used for different tests:

*   **Sodium Fluoride and Potassium Oxalate**: These are typically added to gray vacutainers for [[glucose_estimation|glucose estimation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Potassium oxalate acts as the anticoagulant, while sodium fluoride is an additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Heparin**: This anticoagulant is found in green-colored vacutainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> and is primarily used for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## General Pathology Concepts

### Stellate Scars
A stellate scar typically features a central non-enhancing area, often resembling a star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:09">[02:44:09]</a>. This finding can be observed in various organs:
*   **Kidney**: Oncocytoma and Chromophobe RCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.
*   **Liver**: Focal Nodular Hyperplasia and Fibrolamellar HCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:24">[03:18:24]</a>.
*   **Pancreas**: Serous Cystadenocarcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:18">[03:39:18]</a>.
*   **Breast**: Radial scar, which also presents with a central stellate scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">[03:49:09]</a>.

## Normal Thyroid Histology
The thyroid gland consists of follicles containing pink colloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:02">[06:40:02]</a>.
*   **Follicular epithelial cells**: These cells line the follicles and are the origin of most thyroid cancers, including papillary, follicular, and anaplastic thyroid cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:19">[06:51:19]</a>.
*   **Parafollicular C cells**: These are clusters of cells distinct from the follicles that do not contain colloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:02">[07:06:02]</a>. They release calcitonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. The only thyroid cancer arising from C cells is [[types_of_thyroid_carcinoma | medullary thyroid cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:28">[07:25:28]</a>. Calcitonin is the tumor marker for [[types_of_thyroid_carcinoma | medullary thyroid cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## Thyroid FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology)
[[Histopathological Examination | Thyroid FNAC]] is a crucial diagnostic procedure.
### Adequacy Criteria (Rule of 6/10)
For a [[Histopathological Examination | thyroid FNAC]] to be considered adequate, a pathologist expects to see:
*   At least six follicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:29">[08:11:29]</a>.
*   Each follicle should contain at least 10 cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:46">[08:17:46]</a>.

### Exceptions to Adequacy Rule
A report may still be issued even if the 6/10 rule is not met, under specific circumstances:
*   **Malignancy present**: If malignant cells are observed, the report must be given, regardless of cell count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:34">[09:25:34]</a>.
*   **Colloid Goiter**: In cases of colloid goiter, only fluid (colloid) will be aspirated, making cell counts irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:09">[09:55:09]</a>.
*   **Inflammation**: In inflammatory conditions like Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, thyroid cells are destroyed, and the sample will primarily show inflammatory cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

This system for reporting [[Histopathological Examination | FNAC]] criteria is known as the Bethesda system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:35">[11:10:35]</a>.

## Types of Thyroid Conditions and Tumors

### Non-Toxic Goiter
*   **Clinical Presentation**: A 52-year-old woman presenting with symmetrical enlargement of the thyroid and discomfort during swallowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:07">[04:27:07]</a>. Thyroid function tests are typically normal (euthyroid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:07">[06:05:07]</a>.
*   **Differentiation**: Unlike benign tumors which are usually encapsulated and present as nodules, goiter involves diffuse enlargement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:05">[05:21:05]</a>. It is non-toxic, meaning no symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:07">[06:05:07]</a>.

### [[types_of_thyroid_carcinoma | Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid]]
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Solitary, non-tender, firm nodule in the neck with normal thyroid function tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:13">[11:39:13]</a>.
*   **Key [[Histopathological Examination | Histopathological Examination]] Findings (Biopsy)**:
    *   **Psammoma bodies**: Random blue, calcified material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:05">[12:35:05]</a>.
    *   **True Papillae**: Finger-like projections with a fibrovascular core (containing blood vessels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:15">[13:17:15]</a>.
    *   **Orphan Annie Eye Nucleus**: Optically clear nuclei, often described as white or empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:09">[12:49:09]</a>. This is a formalin-induced artifact and is seen on biopsy, *not* on FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:56">[14:10:56]</a>.
    *   **Intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (INCI)**: Cytoplasm invaginating into the nucleus, appearing as a pink dot within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:16">[15:59:16]</a>.
    *   **Intranuclear grooves (Coffee Bean Nucleus)**: A linear groove visible within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:48">[16:40:48]</a>.
*   **Key [[Histopathological Examination | Histopathological Examination]] Findings (FNAC)**:
    *   All features seen on biopsy except Orphan Annie Eye Nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Chewing gum colloid**: Stretched, thick colloid due to aspiration through a thin needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:06">[17:56:06]</a>.
*   **Genetics**:
    *   Most common: BRAF V600E mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:07">[18:56:07]</a>.
    *   Second most common: RET/PTC fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:34">[19:28:34]</a>. (Note: RET mutation alone is associated with [[types_of_thyroid_carcinoma | medullary thyroid cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>).
*   **Prognosis**: Excellent, with almost 100% survival rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:04">[20:05:04]</a>.
*   **Associations**: Can be caused by radiation exposure (most common thyroid cancer associated with radiation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:05">[20:26:05]</a> and can follow Hashimoto's Thyroiditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:05">[20:29:05]</a>.

### [[types_of_thyroid_carcinoma | Follicular Carcinoma Thyroid]]
*   **Genetics**: Most common mutation is RAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. Other mutations include PTEN, PI3K, and PAX8/PPARÎ³ fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

### [[types_of_thyroid_carcinoma | Medullary Thyroid Cancer]]

*   **Tumor Marker**: Calcitonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Often shows amyloid deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>, which appears as pink material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. Confirmed with Congo Red stain, showing apple-green birefringence under polarizing microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.
*   **Genetics**: Associated with RET (REarranged during Transfection) gene mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>. Specifically, RET gene mutations are linked to MEN 2A and 2B syndromes (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.
    *   *Mnemonic*: "RET 10 MEN MED" (RET gene, on chromosome 10, associated with MEDullary thyroid cancer and MEN syndromes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>.
*   **Differential with RET/PTC Fusion**: A RET mutation alone indicates [[types_of_thyroid_carcinoma | medullary thyroid cancer]], while RET/PTC fusion indicates [[types_of_thyroid_carcinoma | papillary carcinoma thyroid]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:13:00]</a>.
*   **RET Gene Loss of Function**: Leads to Hirschsprung disease (absence of ganglion cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:00">[25:33:00]</a>.

### [[types_of_thyroid_carcinoma | Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer]]

Often accompanied by ophthalmopathy (e.g., exophthalmos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>.
*   **Pathogenesis**: Autoimmune condition caused by Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins (TSI) or Long-Acting Thyroid Stimulators (LATS) antibodies that bind to and stimulate TSH receptors on thyroid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.
*   **Hypersensitivity Reaction**: Classified as Type II hypersensitivity reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>. Some newer classifications put it under Type V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:03:00">[38:03:00]</a>.
*   **Gross Appearance**: Beefy red thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>.
*   **Histology**:
    *   **Follicular Hyperplasia**: Increased number of follicular cells due to overactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Scalloping of Colloid**: The colloid appears "scooped out" or vacuolated at the edges, indicative of increased activity and reabsorption of colloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Pseudo Papillae**: Hyperplasia of follicular cells can form papillary-like structures, but they lack the fibrovascular core seen in true papillae of papillary carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>.

### Hashimoto's Thyroiditis
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Hypothyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>. Thyroid may be symmetrically enlarged (goiter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a>.
*   **Histology**:
    *   **Dense Lymphoid Infiltrate with Germinal Centers**: Significant infiltration of lymphocytes forming aggregates with germinal centers, resembling a lymph node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>. This indicates inflammation and destruction of thyroid tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Hurthle Cells (Askanazy Cells)**: Enlarged, eosinophilic (pink-staining) follicular cells with abundant granular cytoplasm. These cells are a compensatory response to thyroid destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>.

### Riedel's Thyroiditis
*   **Histology**: Characterized by extensive fibrosis throughout the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Palpation**: Leads to a very hard thyroid gland on palpation, often mimicking cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>.

## Connections to other Pathology Topics

### [[Breast Pathology | Breast Pathology]] (Hereditary Cancer, Molecular Classification, Specific Tumors)
*   **HER2/neu Amplification**: In [[Breast Pathology | breast cancer]], HER2/neu (also known as ERBB2 or EGFR2) gene amplification is a common genetic alteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>. This is tested using immunohistochemistry (IHC) (brown stain due to DAB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:29:00">[39:29:00]</a>) and confirmed by FISH if IHC is equivocal (2+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:00">[42:48:00]</a>. A HER2/neu to Chromosome 17 ratio greater than 2.2 indicates amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31:00">[45:31:00]</a>.

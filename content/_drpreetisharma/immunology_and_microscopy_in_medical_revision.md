## Upcoming Revision Schedule
The revision schedule for pathology and microbiology will see some adjustments, with classes shifting from the regular Wednesday slot to other days due to the instructor's commitments in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. A detailed timetable for classes until the first half of April will be updated and posted on Telegram, including links, times, and channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Immunology Revision
[[systemic_pathology_and_bacteriology | General Pathology]] will have a mega quiz focusing on four chapters: Cell Injury, Inflammation, Genetics, and Neoplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Immunology will *not* be included in this general pathology quiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Instead, [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | immunology]] will be covered in a separate, dedicated session before INI CET, due to multiple requests from students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This separate class is intended to provide a focused review of the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## Microscopy in Medical Education
The revision includes detailed discussions and [[microbiological_and_histological_examination_techniques | visual memory]] exercises using screenshots from [[pathology_image_revision | rapid revision videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

Multinucleated giant cells are characteristic findings in various histopathological examinations. They are often encountered in the context of [[granulomatous_lymphadenitis | granulomas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:39">[02:11:39]</a>.

## Histological Features

On fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or biopsy, a multinucleated giant cell is a striking feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. These cells are described as "huge" and contain "multiple nuclei inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:30">[02:43:30]</a>.

### Associated Cell Types
Multinucleated giant cells are typically seen alongside other distinct cell types, particularly in the formation of a [[granulomatous_lymphadenitis | granuloma]]:
*   **Epithelioid Cells**: These cells have elongated or "slipper-shaped" nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. They are a key component observed alongside multinucleated giant cells in both FNAC and biopsy samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
*   **Lymphocytic Collar**: In biopsy images of [[granulomatous_lymphadenitis | granulomas]], a "lymphocytic collar" can be appreciated around the periphery, consisting of tiny blue dot-like cells, which are lymphocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## Role in Granuloma Formation
The presence of multinucleated giant cells, along with epithelioid cells and a lymphocytic collar, constitutes a [[granulomatous_lymphadenitis | granuloma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. These findings are characteristic in conditions such as tuberculosis (TB), where they can be observed in a lymph node biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
Even in the absence of giant cells, the combination of epithelioid cells surrounded by a lymphocytic collar can indicate a [[granulomatous_lymphadenitis | granuloma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

### Caseous Necrosis
In cases of tuberculous [[granulomatous_lymphadenitis | granulomas]], an additional feature that may be seen is "caseous necrosis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. This presents grossly as a "cheesy appearance" on the cut surface of a lymph node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Microscopically, on FNAC, caseous necrosis appears as "pink and granular" or "dirty granular material," which represents cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

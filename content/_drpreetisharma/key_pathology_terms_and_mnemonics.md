*   **CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia)**:
    *   **Histology**: Smudge cells (lymphocytes that appear "smeared" on the slide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. Often described as having a "convent school girl" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>.
*   **CML (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia)**:
    *   **Histology**: "College girl" or "garden party" appearance, where all stages of myeloid maturation (neutrophils, myelocytes, blasts) are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
*   **Burkitt Lymphoma**:
    *   **Clinical**: Often presents as a jaw swelling in an African child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>, endemic due to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.
    *   **Histology**: "Starry sky appearance" (dark tumor cells interspersed with pale macrophages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.
    *   **Genetics**: Translocation involving chromosome 8 and an even number (e.g., t(8;14), t(8;22)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

### Multiple Myeloma

*   **Clinical Presentation**: Lytic bony lesions in elderly patients (e.g., 60-75 years old) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. (Important to differentiate from Langerhans cell histiocytosis in children) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.
*   **Peripheral Smear**:
    *   **Rouleaux Formation**: Red blood cells stacked like "stacks of coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>.
*   **Plasma Cell Morphology**:
    *   **Russell Bodies**: Intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin inclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
    *   **Dutcher Bodies**: Intranuclear immunoglobulin inclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.
    *   **Mott Cells**: Plasma cells filled with multiple Russell bodies, resembling a "mulberry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.
    *   **Flame Cells**: Plasma cells with reddish cytoplasm, typically associated with IgA myeloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>. Most common antibody in multiple myeloma is IgG, but IgA forms flame cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis**:
    *   **M Spike (Monoclonal Spike)**: Detected on protein electrophoresis, typically in the gamma region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>. Indicates increased monoclonal immunoglobulins, most commonly IgG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.
*   **Bone Marrow Aspiration Needles**:
    *   **Salah Needle**: Has a side screw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.
    *   **Jamshidi Needle**: Identified by its "fish-like" shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
*   **Genetics**: Deletion 13q and Translocation (11;14) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

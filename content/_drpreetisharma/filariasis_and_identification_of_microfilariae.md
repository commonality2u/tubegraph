Filariasis is a parasitic infection caused by microfilariae, which are identified through blood investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Identification of Sheathed Microfilariae

Sheathed microfilariae include three main types, often remembered by the mnemonic "LBW" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
*   *Loa loa* (L) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>
*   *Brugia malayi* (B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>
*   *Wuchereria bancrofti* (W) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>

All three are characterized by the presence of a sheath, which appears as an orange-colored layer around the filaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Differentiation among these species relies on examining the presence and arrangement of nuclei at the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### *Wuchereria bancrofti*
*   **Tail Tip:** No nuclei at the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The nuclei end before the tail tip, as if they have "vanished like magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### *Brugia malayi*
*   **Tail Tip:** Typically has two nuclei present at the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### *Loa loa*
*   **Tail Tip:** Shows a continuous line of nuclei extending right till the end of the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations of Filariasis

Filariasis can lead to several distinct clinical presentations:

### Elephantiasis
This classic manifestation involves a swollen limb, resulting from the obstruction of lymphatics by the parasites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Chyluria
If lymphatic channels become severely obstructed and burst, lymph can leak into the urine. This condition is known as chyluria (*kyle* meaning lymph, *ura* meaning urine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The urine appears milky due to the presence of lymphatic fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Onchocerca (River Blindness)
*Onchocerca* is an unsheathed microfilaria, not part of the LBW group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Skin Manifestations:** It can cause "leopard skin" or dermatitis, characterized by very dark skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The infection is often associated with black populations, black flies as a vector, and black skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Ocular Manifestations:** A significant complication is river blindness, which is a form of blindness caused by sclerosing keratitis, where the eye appears entirely covered by a sheath-like layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Treatment:** The drug of choice for river blindness is Ivermectin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Loa loa (African Eye Worm)
*Loa loa*, also known as the African eye worm, is characterized by the visible presence of the worm in the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Calabar Swelling:** This species can cause Kalabar swelling, which is a localized, transient swelling and redness, often considered a hypersensitivity reaction to the parasite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

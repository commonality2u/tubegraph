Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a condition that was discussed in the session, noting its presence in various examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Cause and Genetics

The fundamental defect in CGD is a deficiency of NADPH oxidase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This defect stems from a FOX gene mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

The inheritance pattern can be either X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>:
*   **X-linked recessive** This form is associated with a GP91-phox mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. A mnemonic to remember this is that 9 plus 1 equals 10, which can resemble an 'X', indicating X-linked recessive inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **Autosomal recessive** This form includes mutations in genes like GP47, GP67, GP41, or GP61 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

## Clinical Features

Patients with CGD commonly present with recurrent infections caused by catalase-positive organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. If a microbiologist's report consistently indicates catalase-positive infections, it suggests a case of CGD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

## Diagnosis

Two primary tests are used for diagnosing CGD:
*   **Screening Test: Nitroblue Tetrazolium (NBT) Test**
    *   The full name is Nitroblue Tetrazolium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
    *   This is a screening test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
    *   It is sometimes referred to by the mnemonic "small couple test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Diagnostic Test: Dihydro Rhodamine (DHR) Test**
    *   The diagnostic test is DHR, which stands for Dihydro Rhodamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
    *   The acronyms NBT, DHR, and CGD are often associated together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

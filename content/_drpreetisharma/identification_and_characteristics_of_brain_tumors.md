Brain tumors are often diagnosed and characterized through imaging and histology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. Understanding their specific features, including genetic alterations and microscopic appearances, is crucial for diagnosis and prognosis.

## Types of Brain Tumors and Their Characteristics

### Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma
This tumor is typically seen in children, presenting as a cystic lesion in the cerebellum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Characterized by the presence of pink Rosenthal fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.
*   **Genetics**: Associated with BRAF V600E mutation, though BRAF fusion is more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.
*   **Prognosis**: Considered a "great" tumor with 100% survival following surgical removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.

### Glioblastoma
Often described as a "butterfly glioma" due to its appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Exhibits serpentine necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.
*   **Grade**: It is a Grade IV tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.
*   **Prognosis**: Has a very bad prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>.

### Oligodendroglioma
*   **Histology**: Displays a "fried egg" appearance and "chicken wire blood vessels" on biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.

### Meningioma
This tumor is more commonly observed in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>.
*   **Radiology**: Characterized by a "dural tail sign" on imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Shows a "whirling appearance" of tumor cells, which go "round and round" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.
*   **Other features**: Presence of [[key_pathology_images_and_their_significance | psammoma bodies]] (round calcium deposits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a> and progesterone receptor positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.

## Rosettes in Brain Tumors
Rosettes are specific cellular arrangements seen in various brain tumors. They are classified into pseudo rosettes and true rosettes based on their cellular arrangement and central features.

### Pseudo Rosettes
1.  **Homer Wright Pseudo Rosette**:
    *   **Appearance**: Tumor cells form round structures around a central pink, fibrillar material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. This central area lacks a lumen or blood vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.
    *   **Associated Tumors**: Seen in:
        *   Medulloblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>
        *   Neuroblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>
        *   Ewing sarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>
        *   Retinoblastoma (though true rosettes are more common) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>

2.  **Perivascular Pseudo Rosette**:
    *   **Appearance**: Tumor cells are arranged concentrically around a central blood vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.
    *   **Associated Tumor**: Primarily seen in Ependymoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.

### True Rosettes
*   **Flexner-Wintersteiner Rosette**:
    *   **Appearance**: Characterized by a true lumen or clear central space surrounded by tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Associated Tumor**: The hallmark of Retinoblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

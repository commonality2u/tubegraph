With only 10 days remaining until the January 20th exam, effective utilization of study resources, particularly previous year questions (PYQs), is crucial for FMG students. This period is considered "make or break" for exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Do's and Don'ts for the Last 10 Days

It is essential to focus on what has already been completed rather than dwelling on unfinished subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The goal is to know "little by little" about all 19 subjects, aiming to correctly answer at least five out of ten questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

*   **Don't Study "New" Content**: For subjects already covered, avoid delving into new or rare topics (e.g., rare topics in pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Address Leftover Subjects**: Do not leave any subject completely unstudied. For untouched subjects like orthopedics, anesthesia, or forensics, utilize shorter resources. At a minimum, watch 3-hour Last Minute Revision (LRR) sessions or crash courses from any platform, aiming to solve at least 50% of questions from these topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## Resource Prioritization by Subject Category

To effectively manage the vast syllabus, subjects can be categorized and approached with specific resources:

### Short Subjects
This category includes ENT, Ophthalmology, Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, and Dermatology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: For these eight subjects, allocate approximately 2.5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.
*   **Resources**:
    *   If you are a fast reader, review your rapid revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
    *   Otherwise, prioritize YouTube's LRR sessions combined with all previous year questions and topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

### Giant/Volatile Subjects
These include Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM (Community Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. These subjects are often difficult to memorize and retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Do not attempt to read main videos or even rapid revision videos for these subjects at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   **Resources**: Revert to basics: LRR and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. Even just listening to videos is beneficial if you cannot actively read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.
*   **For highly volatile subjects like Pharmacology and Microbiology**: Adopt a mindset of studying them once and then moving on, as they are not easy to master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>. Utilize their LRR sessions (e.g., 4 hours for Pharma) and around 150-200 previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[29:46:00]</a>.

### Clinical Subjects
This includes Medicine, Pathology, and Physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Focus solely on previous year topics and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. A full revision of Medicine, for instance, is not feasible in 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

## Effective MCQ Practice and PYQs

### Grand Tests (GTs)
The decision to take Grand Tests in the last 9-10 days is personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Caution**: If you are prone to panic from low scores (below 150), avoid taking GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: If you do take a GT (e.g., on PrepLadder), focus on [[approach_to_final_exam_preparation | time management]] (completing 300 questions within the given time) and identifying silly mistakes, rather than the score itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   **New Questions in GTs**: Expect 20-30 "bouncer" questions in any GT that may seem unfamiliar. Do not let these questions dictate your confidence or assessment of your preparation, as they are meant to prevent overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:05:00">[42:05:00]</a>. Your score is determined by easy questions, silly mistakes, and time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:00">[42:27:00]</a>.

### General MCQ Practice
Allocate 60% of your study time to MCQs and 40% to theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:10]</a>.
*   **Explanation Review**:
    *   If an MCQ is answered correctly, **do not** read its explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
    *   If an MCQ is answered incorrectly, quickly review the explanation superficially. Determine if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap. If a knowledge problem, quickly read 5-10 lines on the topic and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Do not do a PhD on a single topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
*   **Quantity**: Aim for at least 150+ MCQs daily; some successful students have done 300+ daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. If currently doing 100, incrementally increase by 10-15 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.
*   **Type of Questions**:
    *   PYQs are essential: FMG's last five years' PYQs must be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>.
    *   Supplement with new questions, especially those related to previous year *topics* (e.g., if Apoptosis was a PYQ topic, solve all related MCQs from the Q-bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.
    *   Avoid rote memorization of PYQ answers; instead, focus on understanding the underlying topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:02:00]</a>.
    *   If time permits after FMG PYQs, review NEET PG's last three years' papers and optionally the NEET PG November session paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.

### Last Day Revision
On the day before the exam, focus on highly volatile or weak subjects. This includes cycles of biochemistry, microbiology catalysts, nerve supplies, pharmacology drugs, and biostatistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:54:00">[43:54:00]</a>. The last day should primarily involve revising PYQs and LRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>.

## Daily Study Structure

Your day should be divided into four time slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>:
1.  **Study Pattern (Theory and MCQs)**: This will occupy the majority of your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Images**: Dedicate one hour daily to quickly scan through images, especially from the subjects you studied that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. Image-based revision can significantly speed up your review process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:43:00">[51:43:00]</a>.
3.  **Sanity Time**: Allocate 30 minutes for a break that is away from books. This could be a light walk outdoors or a brief period on social media, but strictly limit it to avoid it extending to hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.
4.  **Sleep**: Ensure a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep to keep your brain working effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Do not compromise sleep or experiment with medications to stay awake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

## Mindset and Mental Preparation

*   **Normalize Sleep Cycle**: Align your sleep schedule with the exam timings so you are alert during morning hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Positivity**: Surround yourself with positive people (family, good friends, teachers) and avoid those who spread rumors or boast about high scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
*   **Anxiety Management**: Do not let negative thoughts or overthinking about exam-day logistics (alarm, reaching center, computer issues) consume you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>. One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>.
*   **Sustained Focus**: The "Pomodoro technique" of short study bursts is not suitable for the last 9 days. Train yourself to sit for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch with full concentration, mirroring the exam environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Present**: Work in "boxes" of a few hours, focusing only on what needs to be done in that specific timeframe. Do not think about future outcomes or past GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:09:00">[51:09:00]</a>.
*   **Expected Exam Pattern**: Be aware that one paper of the FMG exam might be tough and the other easier to balance out. Do not discuss Paper 1 during the break if it was difficult; immediately shift focus to Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:40]</a>.

By following these strategies, FMG students can effectively utilize their remaining time and resources to maximize their chances of crossing the 150-plus score needed to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>.

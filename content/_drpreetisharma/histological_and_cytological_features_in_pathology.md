## Renal Pathology

### Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
Various types of renal cell carcinoma are identified based on their distinctive [[pathological_features_of_various_diseases | histological features]] and genetic alterations:

*   **Papillary RCC**
    *   **Histology:** Features tall cells arranged in papillae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>. It is characterized by the presence of psammoma bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:40">[06:19:40]</a>.
    *   **Genetics:** Often associated with Trisomy 7 and 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a> and loss of the Y chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:48">[07:08:48]</a>. The Fumarate Hydratase (FH) gene mutation is specifically linked to hereditary leiomyomatosis and papillary RCC (HLRCC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:59">[07:56:59]</a>.

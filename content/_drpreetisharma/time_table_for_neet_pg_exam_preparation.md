This article outlines a structured timetable and strategies for students preparing for the NEET PG exam, specifically those aiming for a March 3rd exam date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. It provides a three-round study plan, general advice on resource utilization, and tips for managing grand tests and "nightmare" subjects.

## General Study Principles

### Daily Targets for Pathology and Microbiology
Daily targets for Pathology and Microbiology will be provided through a sheet, outlining topics to be covered from rapid revision videos or preferred alternative sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. These targets are designed to ensure consistent progress in these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. For students who cannot dedicate multi-day blocks to these subjects, consistent daily study of 40 minutes can cover them within a month and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>.

### Kickstart Morning Sessions
"Kickstart Morning" sessions are scheduled to encourage early waking (e.g., 7:30 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. These sessions will focus on MCQ-based discussions of topics previously assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Kickstart Morning sessions for Pathology and Microbiology will commence once students have completed their first round of rapid revision videos for these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.

### Utilizing Resources: Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision
The choice between main videos and rapid revision (RR) depends on prior preparation:
*   If you have already covered 85-90% of the syllabus from any source, prioritize rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   For specific "bulky" or "deadly" subjects that yield many questions, main videos are recommended to ensure in-depth understanding, especially given the current exam pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>:
    *   Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>
    *   Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>
    *   OBG (Obstetrics and Gynecology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>
    *   PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine) – due to atypical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>
    *   Anatomy – if you feel weak in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>

For other subjects, especially if you have previously studied them, RR notes can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. However, RR alone is not sufficient; it must be complemented with question bank practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>.

### Previous Year Topics (PYTTs)
Focus on PYTTs is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. PYTTs are readily available from various sources, including Instagram posts by helpful students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   **Frequency**: Fortnightly (every two weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. If you tend to get demotivated by GT scores, consider giving them once every three weeks until you develop a positive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
*   **Time Allocation**: Dedicate half a day to a GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. The exam itself takes about 3.5 hours, leaving the rest of the half-day for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   Do **not** read explanations for correct answers, as you are already revising these notes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.
    *   Focus intensely on the **incorrect** answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. Analyze *why* they were wrong: silly mistake, unknown topic, new concept, or lack of time/effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: GTs are for analyzing your progress and identifying weaknesses, not for judging your final rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. They help assess time management and pinpoint areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.
*   **Baseline GT**: Give a grand test before starting the new timetable without judging yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. This provides a baseline for tracking progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

### Last-Minute Revision (LRR)
For NEET PG students, the main LRR will be conducted in January and February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. Attending LRR sessions for other exams, like FMGE, can still be beneficial for covering PYQs and general revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

## Three-Round Timetable for NEET PG Preparation

This timetable is designed to cover the entire syllabus in three rounds, leading up to the exam. It incorporates buffers for backlog and grand tests.

### Round 1: Until January 10th
This round allows for a liberal allocation of days to ensure thorough coverage, especially if referring to main videos.
*   Anatomy: 5 days (or 3 days if using RR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>
*   ENT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>
*   Pathology: 4 days (or 3 days if done with classes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>
*   Dermatology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>

*   Physiology: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>

**Daily Medicine Integration**: Throughout Round 1, dedicate 1.5-2 hours daily to Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. This integrated approach ensures consistent exposure to this bulky subject.

**Pending Days**: Days marked "Pending" in the timetable are buffer days for backlogs or for taking a grand test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.

### Round 2: From January 11th Onwards
This round focuses on quicker revision.
*   Medicine: 4 days for comprehensive revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>.
*   ENT/Ophthalmology/Short Subjects: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>.
*   Pharmacology: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.
*   Pediatrics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:00">[22:58:00]</a>.
*   Surgery: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>.
*   OBGY: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.

### Round 3: From February 8th Until Exam
This final round is for intensive, quick revision of high-yield and volatile topics.
*   Short Subjects (ENT, Ophthalmology, Physiology, etc.): Less than a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:00]</a>.
*   Medicine: 3 days (final revision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>.
*   Pharmacology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>.
*   PSM: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.
*   Other Subjects: 1-2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>.
*   Last Week: Focus on volatile subjects like Anatomy, Biochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>. Microbiology will be covered in LRR and daily targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>.

## Customization and Flexibility

*   **Adaptability**: This timetable is a guideline. You can adjust the order of subjects or days based on your remaining syllabus and personal strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>.
*   **Buffer Days**: The timetable explicitly includes buffer days for backlogs, unexpected events, or additional grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. This accounts for anxiety, panic attacks, or sick days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Balancing Notes & MCQs**: The extra days allocated for subjects are intended for both note revision and extensive MCQ practice. Aim for 100-150 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>. Increase your daily question count gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.

## Internship Specifics

For interns preparing for NEET PG:
*   Follow the same subject sequence as the general timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:00">[28:15:00]</a>.
*   Add one extra day to each subject's allocated time to account for work commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>.
*   Rely exclusively on Rapid Revision (RR) and a question bank; avoid main videos due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[28:50:00]</a>.
*   Utilize less demanding postings during your internship to quickly cover short subjects like Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, and Forensics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>. Completing these provides a significant confidence boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>.
*   Integrate daily targets for Pathology and Microbiology (40 minutes/day) by watching videos even during routine tasks like writing reports or inserting cannulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>.

## Addressing Common Concerns

### Confidence and Mindset
*   **Lack of Confidence**: It's normal not to feel confident even after multiple revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>. Confidence often comes from seeing numerical results, such as improving scores in question practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13:00">[40:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a>.
*   **Past Results**: Do not dwell on past exam ranks or GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:50:00">[48:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:21:00">[49:21:00]</a>. Treat each day as a fresh start and focus on working positively towards the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:06:00">[49:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:30:00">[49:30:00]</a>.

### "Nightmare" Subjects
Identify your 3-4 "nightmare" subjects (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>. Tackle these head-on by studying them thoroughly from main videos or notes, practicing extensive questions, and dedicating sufficient time (4-5 days per subject) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>. Overcoming the fear is the first step to mastering them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:39:00">[41:39:00]</a>.

### Time Management and Study Habits
*   **Study Hours**: 10-11 hours of *pure study output* per day is an excellent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:23:00">[44:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:48:00">[44:48:00]</a>. Avoid pushing for excessively long hours if it leads to mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42:00">[44:42:00]</a>.
*   **Breaks**: Avoid the Pomodoro technique (short breaks) for exam preparation, as exams require sustained vigilance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:47:00">[51:47:00]</a>. Instead, train yourself for long study stretches (e.g., 2.5-3 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:17:00">[52:17:00]</a>. Take 15-minute breaks after these stretches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:41:00">[52:41:00]</a>.
*   **QBank Integration**: QBank practice is integrated into the daily timetable; there are no separate QBank days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:53:00">[36:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:22:00">[37:22:00]</a>. The extra days given for subjects are meant to accommodate this practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:06:00">[37:06:00]</a>.
    *   For bulky subjects (Medicine, Surgery, OBG, PSM, Anatomy, Pharmacology), aim to cover the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:58:00">[32:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[57:05:00]</a>.
    *   For short subjects, the RR QBank is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:49:00">[56:49:00]</a>.
*   **PYQs**:
    *   **NEET PG**: Go back at least 5 years for PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:43:00">[34:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:00">[34:46:00]</a>.
    *   **INI CET**: Review the last 3 years of INI CET questions, as there's increasing overlap with NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>.
    *   **[[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | FMGE]]**: For [[fmge_exam_preparation strategies | FMGE]] PYQs, watch 2-2.5 hour discussion sessions for the last 5 years on 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:44:00">[35:44:00]</a>. If using books, cover the last 3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Importance**: PYQs are important, but relying *only* on them is insufficient for a good rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:30:00">[36:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>. PYT (Previous Year Topics) are important, especially when combined with rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:40:00">[36:40:00]</a>.

### CBME Pattern Relevance
The CBME (Competency-Based Medical Education) pattern is primarily for MBBS curriculum and is not directly significant for the NEET PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:33:00">[43:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:18:00">[44:18:00]</a>. NEET PG questions are integrated, but studying subjects organ-system wise (as taught in videos) first provides a strong basic understanding for later integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:00">[43:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>.

### Last-Minute Notes
The LRR sessions and daily targets will cover high-yield topics, eliminating the need for candidates to decide what to read on the last day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. These topics are curated based on maximum chances of appearing in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

This comprehensive timetable, combined with strategic study habits and a positive mindset, is designed to guide students effectively towards their NEET PG goals.

*Leptospira* is a spiral organism belonging to the spirochete family, particularly identifiable by its hooked ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This bacterium is the causative agent of Weil's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A patient with Weil's disease, such as a 35-year-old farmer, may present to the emergency department with a history of fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches for the past two days, accompanied by mild vomiting and diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Transmission and Pathophysiology
The life cycle of *Leptospira* involves a mnemonic using "lots of Rs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>:
*   **Rats**: The disease is caused by rat urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Rainy water**: Rat urine contaminates or mixes with rainy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Rice field workers**: This contaminated water then comes into contact with individuals working in rice fields or paddy fields, which are crops requiring a lot of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These workers subsequently contract the *Leptospira* bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Laboratory Investigations
Investigations for *Leptospira* include culture testing and serological investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Culture
On culture, *Leptospira* produces a characteristic "dinger's ring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This ring is obtained on EMJH media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Serological Testing
Serological tests are performed to detect antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Relevant serological tests mentioned in the context of [[systemic_pathology_and_bacteriology | bacteriology]] include:
*   Cold agglutination test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Standard agglutination test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   Microscopic agglutination test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

(The specific agglutination test for *Leptospira* is posed as a homework question for the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>).

## Role of Rapid Revision in FMGE Success

Rapid Revision (RR) plays a crucial role in [[fmge_preparation_strategy | FMGE preparation]], particularly when there are approximately two months left until the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This approach is highly recommended for effectively covering the syllabus.

### How to Utilize Rapid Revision

The primary method for studying should involve rapid revision videos and notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. When a concept within rapid revision material is unclear, students should refer to the main videos for a brief period (e.g., 10 minutes) to clarify their doubts, then return to the rapid revision content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This ensures that main videos are used strategically only for clarification, not for comprehensive study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

For those who have not studied a subject previously, using a platform's rapid revision is a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. It's essential to stick to one source throughout the preparation to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

### Subjects and Their Rapid Revision Allocation

Rapid revision is applicable across all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Specifically:
*   **Pathology:** Three days are allocated for rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Microbiology:** Three days are allocated for rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Physiology:** For quicker subjects, combining quick notes, rapid revision, and LRR (Last Minute Revision) can help complete the subject in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

### Integration with Daily Targets and Revisions

During the first round of revision, subjects like Pathology and Microbiology are primarily covered through rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. After this initial round, daily targets for these subjects will be provided, focusing on key topics that are likely to appear in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. These daily targets for Pathology and Microbiology are expected to finish before January 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### Rapid Revision vs. Main Videos for Comprehensive Subjects

While some subjects like surgery and OBGY (Obstetrics and Gynecology) are considered "high-yielding," the focus should remain on rapid revision due to limited time (approximately 65 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. Starting main videos for each subject, which can take 70-80 hours per subject, is not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>. The goal is to finish the course content efficiently to allow for multiple revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

If a student has little to no prior knowledge of a subject, rapid revision might initially seem intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. In such cases, one can quickly refer to main videos for concepts, then return to rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. For extremely weak subjects, extending the allocated rapid revision time slightly (e.g., taking six days instead of four for OBGY) to cover main videos might be acceptable, but this flexibility should not be applied to all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>.

### Importance of PQY (Previous Year Questions) and MCQs with Rapid Revision

Alongside theory, practicing MCQs daily is crucial, as the exam is on January 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Students should aim for at least 100+ MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Even if starting with fewer, gradually increasing the number by 5-7 questions daily can lead to reaching the 100-mark within a week and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. These MCQs should be practiced *alongside* theoretical study, not separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

It is important to focus on previous year *topics* rather than just memorizing previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. For questions, students should use their chosen Q-bank and previous year questions, either through an app or FMG solutions textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Making Notes and Revision Efficient

To make revision efficient, especially for the last days before the exam, students should highlight only the main five words or key concepts on each page of their notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. This "miserly" highlighting ensures that only essential information is re-read during quick revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

### Adequacy of Rapid Revision for FMGE

Rapid revision notes and videos are considered 100% sufficient for the [[fmge_december_2023_exam_preparation_strategy | FMGE December 2023 Exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. Simply reading LRR (Last Minute Revision) alone, however, may not be enough to score 150+ or 200+ marks; supplementary question practice is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. The objective of rapid revision is to ensure comprehensive coverage and understanding, supporting the goal of achieving a good score in the FMGE exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

This article focuses on strategies for medical students preparing for exams, particularly the FMGE, with a focus on the crucial final days leading up to the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. The last 10 days before an exam are considered a "make or break" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>.

## Overall Strategy for Final Days

*   **No New Learning in Studied Subjects**: For subjects already covered, do not delve into new or rare topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   **Cover All Subjects**: Do not leave any subject untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Aim to know a little bit about all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, specifically enough to answer at least 50% of questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Revision Methods**: For remaining subjects or those not fully covered, focus on rapid revision through:
    *   3-hour LRR (Last Minute Revision) sessions or crash courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
    *   Rapid revision notes if you are a fast reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
    *   Previous year questions (PYQs) and topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.
*   **Scanning Machine Approach**: In the final days, become a "scanning machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>, quickly reviewing everything you have already read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.

### Managing Different Subject Types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>

*   **Short Subjects**: Allocate approximately two and a half days for subjects like ENT, Forensic Medicine, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Psychiatry, Radiology, and Dermatology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. For these, use YouTube LRR sessions and solve all previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.
*   **Giant/Volatile Subjects**: These include Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. These are difficult to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a> and no one truly knows them perfectly due to their volatile nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>. For these, rely on LRR sessions and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. If you can't read Pharmacology, at least do 4 hours of LRR and 150-200 PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[29:46:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Subjects**: For subjects like Medicine, focus only on previous year topics and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

## Daily Study Routine and [[Time management and study planning for exams | Time Management]]

*   **Study Hours**: Aim for a minimum of 12-14 hours of productive study per day, ensuring full concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. If you can complete your daily targets in less time (e.g., 8-9 hours), that's an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>.
*   **Daily Time Slots**: Divide your day into four main slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>:
    1.  **Theory and MCQs**: Allocate 60% of your study time to MCQs and 40% to theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. When doing MCQs, review explanations to cover theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.
    2.  **Images**: Dedicate one hour daily to reviewing images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. Quickly scan through images from the subjects you studied that day before sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. [[Clinical Pathology Practical Techniques | Image-based revision]] can cover a subject quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:43:00">[51:43:00]</a>.
    3.  **Sanity/Break Time**: Allocate 30 minutes daily for personal sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. Ideally, engage in outdoor activity like a light walk, keeping your phone away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. This helps prevent mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. Avoid turning this into hours of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.
*   **Practice Longer Study Sessions**: Discard the Pomodoro technique for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>. Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch without distractions to simulate exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:29:00">[53:29:00]</a>.

## Mastering Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs)

*   **Quantity**: Aim to solve at least 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>, ideally trying to cross 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a>. If you can only do 100, increase by 10-15 questions each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.
*   **Review Strategy**:
    *   **Correct MCQs**: Do not read the explanation if you answer correctly; it means you already understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Incorrect MCQs**: Superficially read the explanation to understand why you got it wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Identify if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. If a knowledge problem, quickly read 5-10 lines on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**:
    *   Complete the last five years of FMGE PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>.
    *   If time permits, complete the last three years of NEET PG questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.
    *   Focus on [[study_and_revision_strategies_for_bacteriology | previous year *topics*]], not just memorizing answers to specific PYQs, as questions are no longer copied directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. Solve new MCQs related to these topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>.
    *   If unable to solve papers yourself, listen to recall sessions on YouTube at 1.5x or 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.

## Grand Test (GT) Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>

*   **Purpose**: Use GTs primarily for [[time_management_and_study_planning_for_exams | time management]] and identifying silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:25:00">[43:25:00]</a>.
*   **Score Irrelevance**: Do *not* focus on the score (e.g., hitting 150+) during final GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16:00">[51:16:00]</a>. A low score might cause panic and hinder further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   **Analyzing Mistakes**: If stuck on GT scores (e.g., 130-150), quickly analyze where mistakes are occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:46:00">[42:46:00]</a>:
    *   **Silly Mistakes**: Indicates not reading questions carefully; practice more MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Knowledge Gaps**: Indicates unfamiliarity with topics; revisit LRR notes and relevant topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:09:00">[43:09:00]</a>.
*   **Expect Bouncers**: Every GT will have 20-30 "new" or "bouncer" questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. Do not let these demotivate you; your success is determined by known topics and avoiding silly errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:00">[42:27:00]</a>.
*   **Exam Paper Fluctuation**: Be prepared for one exam paper to be tough and the other easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:45:00">[40:45:00]</a>. Do not discuss Paper 1 during the break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>; immediately shift focus to Paper 2 without carrying any backlog or hangover from the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:00">[40:30:00]</a>.

## Maintaining Mental Well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>

*   **Positivity**: Focus on positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Talk only to people who give positive vibes, such as family and good friends, and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Negativity**: Stay away from those who boast of high scores or spread rumors about exam difficulty/pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39:00">[24:39:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Overthink Future Scenarios**: Block out unnecessary thoughts about exam day logistics (e.g., alarm, reaching center, computer working) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>. Focus on what needs to be done in the next few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:18:00">[54:18:00]</a>.
*   **Combat Forgetting and Exhaustion**: It's normal to feel like you're forgetting subjects or to feel exhausted and sleepy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>. Remember, no one can memorize all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>. If you forget something, pick it up and revise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>. Avoid self-medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>.
*   **Survival Mode**: In the last 9 days, adopt a "survival mode" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34:00">[30:34:00]</a>. Study even if it feels boring or difficult, as the goal is to pass the exam and then not pick up these notes again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:46:00">[37:46:00]</a>.

## Last Day Preparation

*   **Focus on PYQs and LRR**: On the last day, only revise previous year questions and LRR materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>.
*   **Volatile Topics**: Prioritize volatile subjects and topics that you tend to forget, such as biochemistry cycles, microbiology catalysts, nerve supplies, pharmacology drugs, and biostatistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:54:00">[43:54:00]</a>.
*   **No Experimentation**: Stick to your established routine; do not experiment with new medications or drastic changes the day before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Ensure a minimum of six hours of sleep so your brain functions optimally during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.

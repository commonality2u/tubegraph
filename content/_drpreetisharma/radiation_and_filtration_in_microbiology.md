In the realm of [[sterilization_and_disinfection_methods | sterilization and disinfection]], physical methods like radiation and filtration play a crucial role. These techniques are vital for maintaining sterile environments in various settings, including medical laboratories and operating theaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

## Radiation Methods

Radiation methods for [[sterilization_and_disinfection_methods | sterilization]] are categorized into ionizing and non-ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

### Ionizing Radiation (Cold Sterilization)
*   **Types** Ionizing radiation includes X-rays and gamma rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.
*   **Effect on Temperature** These forms of radiation do not increase the temperature of the materials being sterilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>. This characteristic earns it the name "cold sterilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
*   **Applications** Ionizing radiation is used for:
    *   Sterilizing [[microbiological_techniques_for_transporting_and_growing_cultures | catgut sutures]], which would lose strength if autoclaved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.
    *   Pre-packed syringes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.
    *   Grafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

### Non-Ionizing Radiation (Hot Sterilization)
*   **Types** This category includes ultraviolet (UV) rays and infrared rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
*   **Effect on Temperature** Unlike ionizing radiation, non-ionizing radiation increases the temperature of the treated items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>, thus being referred to as "hot sterilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   **Applications** Non-ionizing radiation is primarily used for:
    *   Operating Theater (OT) fumigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>.
    *   Sterilizing biosafety cabinets in [[microbiological_techniques_for_transporting_and_growing_cultures | microbiology]] laboratories, where microbiologists handle infectious samples and culture plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.

### Control for Radiation
The effectiveness of radiation [[sterilization_and_disinfection_methods | techniques]] is checked using *Bacillus pumilus* as a biological indicator or control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

## Filtration Methods

Filtration is a physical method of [[sterilization_and_disinfection_methods | sterilization]] that involves passing liquids or air through filters to remove microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>.

*   **Modern Filters** Modern filtration systems, like those found in water and air purifiers, commonly use HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>. While HEPA filters are widely used, Alpha filters are considered the most effective in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.
*   **Historical Filters** In the past, Seitz filters were used for water and liquid filtration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. However, their use has been discontinued because they contained asbestos, a known carcinogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Pore Size** The typical pore size of these filters is 0.22 microns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.
*   **Control for Filtration** The control organism used to verify the effectiveness of filtration is *Brevundimonas diminuta* (formerly *Pseudomonas diminuta*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. Its small size makes it suitable for testing filters with very small pore sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.

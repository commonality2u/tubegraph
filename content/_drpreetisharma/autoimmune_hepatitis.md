Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease characterized by the immune system attacking the liver, often responding well to immunosuppressive therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation & Diagnosis
A typical presentation may include a young woman with a four-week history of jaundice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>. Key diagnostic steps and findings include:
*   **Exclusion of other causes:** Serology markers for viral [[hepatitis_and_liver_disorders | hepatitis]] (e.g., Hepatitis A, B, C) are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) tests are also negative, ruling out Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.
*   **Response to steroids:** Patient symptoms and signs often abate and decrease following treatment with corticosteroids, indicating an autoimmune disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.

## Histological Features
Liver biopsy findings are crucial for diagnosing autoimmune hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>:
*   **Lymphocytes and plasma cells:** The biopsy shows an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells within the liver tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.
*   **Interface Hepatitis:** This refers to inflammation at the junction of the liver parenchyma and the portal triad, where lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrate, obscuring the normal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. This means the inflammation (lymphocytes and plasma cells) is happening at the border of the liver and bile duct system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
*   **Emperipolesis:** Characterized by large cells that have "eaten up" smaller cells, indicating an engulfment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This is a very characteristic feature that may be seen in exam images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>.
*   **Hepatocyte Rosettes:** Liver cells (hepatocytes) are present in sheets and form round structures, resembling rosettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

## Types and Associated Antibodies
Autoimmune hepatitis is classified into types based on the presence of specific autoantibodies:

*   **Type 1 Autoimmune Hepatitis:**
    *   Associated with Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.
    *   Associated with Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibodies (ASMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.
    *   Associated with Soluble Liver Antigen (SLA) antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.

*   **Type 2 Autoimmune Hepatitis:**
    *   Primarily associated with Anti-Liver Kidney Microsomal antibodies (Anti-LKM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
    *   Specifically, Anti-LKM2 antibodies are commonly linked to drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. This connection can be remembered by the mnemonic "drugs do, drugs do" (LKM *two* for drug-induced) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
    *   Anti-LKM1 and Anti-LKM3 antibodies are associated with [[hepatitis_and_liver_disorders | Hepatitis C]] and [[hepatitis_and_liver_disorders | Hepatitis D]] respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

*   **Type 3 Autoimmune Hepatitis:**
    *   Also associated with Soluble Liver Antigen (SLA) antibodies, similar to Type 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

### Other Related Points
*   Autoimmune hepatitis should be differentiated from other conditions causing jaundice, such as [[hepatitis_and_liver_disorders | Gilbert's Syndrome]] (unconjugated bilirubin), [[hepatitis_and_liver_disorders | Crigler-Najjar syndrome]] (unconjugated bilirubin), [[hepatitis_and_liver_disorders | Dubin-Johnson Syndrome]] (conjugated bilirubin, dark pigmented liver), and [[hepatitis_and_liver_disorders | Rotor Syndrome]] (conjugated bilirubin, no liver pigment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.
*   One patient case combined features of megaloblastic anemia and [[thyroid_conditions_and_pathology | Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] (an autoimmune [[thyroid_conditions_and_pathology | thyroid]] disease characterized by lymphocytes and goiter) leading to a discussion of autoimmune conditions manifesting together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]] (TB) is an aerobic organism that requires a lot of oxygen for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>. This characteristic is important for understanding its growth patterns in culture media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>.

## Diagnosis and Identification

### Culture Media
The standard culture medium for [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]] is Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>.
*   **Composition**: LJ medium contains eggs, mineral salt solution, malachite green, and asparagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>. The malachite green gives it a greenish color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.
*   **Growth Time**: [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]] takes approximately six to eight weeks to grow on LJ medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>. Rapid growers, which are atypical mycobacteria, can produce colonies within one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.
*   **Colony Appearance**: On LJ medium, [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]] exhibits a "rough, buff, tough" colony appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:53">[01:23:53]</a>.
    *   "Rough" indicates they are not shiny and look dull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:03">[01:24:03]</a>.
    *   "Buff" refers to a creamy or off-white color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12">[01:24:12]</a>.
    *   "Tough" means they are difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.
*   **Contrast with *Mycobacterium bovis***: *Mycobacterium bovis* shows the opposite characteristics, appearing as "smooth, white, weaker" colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>.

### Microscopic Observation
[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]] is decolourized by 20-25% sulfuric acid in the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.

### Modern Diagnostic Methods
*   **MGIT (Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube)**: This method detects mycobacterial growth using an indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.
    *   Initially, oxygen is present, inhibiting fluorescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>.
    *   When [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]] is added, it consumes the oxygen (as it is aerobic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>.
    *   Once oxygen is depleted, fluorescence appears, indicating growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>. The intensity of the fluorescence can indicate the bacterial load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>.

*   **GeneXpert (CBNAAT - Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test)**: GeneXpert is a rapid and efficient diagnostic tool for [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>.
    *   **Turnaround Time (TAT)**: It provides results in approximately two hours, significantly faster than traditional culture methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>.
    *   **Dual Functionality**: It not only diagnoses TB but also identifies resistance to key anti-tuberculosis drugs like Rifampicin and Isoniazid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:40">[01:31:40]</a>.
    *   **Rifampicin Resistance**: Resistance to Rifampicin is associated with the RPOB B gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>.
    *   **Nucleic Acid Based**: As a nucleic acid-based test, it is generally considered superior to culture media for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:09">[01:32:09]</a>.

## Treatment Considerations
When treating [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]], anti-tuberculosis drugs are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>. Most of these drugs are bactericidal, meaning they kill bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>. However, Ethambutol is an exception, as it is a bacteriostatic drug, meaning it stops bacterial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>.

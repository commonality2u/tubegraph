## Giant Cells

Giant cells are characterized by their large size and multiple nuclei. Various types are associated with specific conditions and have distinct appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Langhans Giant Cells
*   **Appearance**: Horseshoe-shaped arrangement of nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Association**: Commonly seen in [[cases_of_tuberculosis_and_caseous_necrosis | tuberculosis (TB)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### Touton Giant Cells
*   **Appearance**: Nuclei arranged in a round, wreath-like pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, often associated with lipid-containing diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Association**: Seen in xanthomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

### Foreign Body Giant Cells
*   **Appearance**: Nuclei are arranged everywhere within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Reed-Sternberg Cells
*   **Appearance**: Characterized by an "Owl's Eye" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, often described as having "pink color eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Association**: Seen in Hodgkin's Lymphoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Vidan-Finkeldey Giant Cells
*   **Appearance**: A specific type of giant cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Association**: Seen in measles, which presents with fever and the "three C's" (cough, coryza, conjunctivitis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
*   **Appearance**: Features an "Owl's Eye" appearance with "blue color eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## Granulomas

Granulomas are organized collections of macrophages, often with other cells, formed in response to persistent inflammatory stimuli.

### Stellate Granuloma
*   **Appearance**: Star-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Associations**:
    *   Cat Scratch Disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>
    *   Lymphogranuloma Venereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>

### Doughnut Granuloma
*   **Appearance**: Resembles a doughnut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Associations**:
    *   Q fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>
    *   Allopurinol overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>

### Durck's Granuloma (Cerebral Granuloma)
*   **Appearance**: Characterized by "two parallel lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Location**: Seen in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Association**: Cerebral malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### Putty Kidney (Tuberculosis of the Kidney)
*   **Gross Appearance**: Kidney with [[cases_of_tuberculosis_and_caseous_necrosis | caseous necrosis]] and calcification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.
*   **Association**: Renal tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. This appearance may also be seen in radiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

### Nodular Glomerular Sclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson Lesions)
*   **Association**: A kidney finding in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, especially when HbA1c levels are very high (e.g., 8, 9, 10, 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

### Starry Sky Appearance
*   **Immunofluorescence**: Seen in Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN), characterized by a shining, granular pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. PSGN often presents with cola-colored urine and a "flea-bitten kidney" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. It is a pediatric nephritic syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

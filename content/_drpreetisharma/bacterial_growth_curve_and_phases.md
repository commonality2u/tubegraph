A [[Bacterial growth curve and phases | bacterial growth curve]] illustrates the number of bacteria over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. It is divided into four distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.

## Phases of Bacterial Growth

### Lag Phase
The lag phase is characterized by a flat line on the growth curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>. During this phase, bacteria increase in size but do not immediately multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. They gather raw materials, produce enzymes, and metabolites, preparing for rapid division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. This is a period of adaptation, often referred to as the "silence before the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. The maximum size of bacteria is reached at the end of the lag phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

### Log Phase (Exponential Phase)
Following the lag phase, the log phase shows an exponential increase in the number of bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>. This phase is marked by maximum bacterial activity, with all bacteria actively dividing and multiplying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. Since all bacteria are living, staining results during this phase would be uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.

### Stationary Phase
The stationary phase is represented by a plateau on the growth curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>. In this phase, the number of live cells is approximately equal to the number of dead cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. Consequently, staining may appear non-uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.
Key processes that occur during the stationary phase include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>:
*   Sporulation (spore formation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>
*   Toxin production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>
*   Antibiotic production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>

### Decline Phase
The decline phase is characterized by a drop in the number of bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. This occurs when the number of dead bacterial cells exceeds the number of live cells, indicating that most bacteria have died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>.

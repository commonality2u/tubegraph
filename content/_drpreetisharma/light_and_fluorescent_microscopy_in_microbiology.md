[[types_and_uses_of_microscopes_in_microbiology | Microscopy]] is a fundamental [[microbiological_and_histological_examination_techniques | technique]] in microbiology, used to visualize microorganisms and [[microbiological_techniques_and_tests | structures]] that are not visible to the naked eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>. This article focuses on the principles and applications of light and fluorescent microscopes.

## Light Microscope

A light microscope is a common type of microscope used for observing [[types_and_uses_of_microscopes_in_microbiology | specimens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>.

### Components and Principles
*   **Light Source**
    *   A light microscope uses **transmitted light** to illuminate the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Condenser**
    *   The condenser is a crucial structure located **below the stage** that concentrates light onto the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Stage**
    *   The stage is the platform where the specimen slide is placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Lenses**
    *   **Objective Lens:** Located near the object (specimen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Common objective lens magnifications include 4x, 10x, 40x, and 100x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Eyepiece Lens (Ocular Lens):** Located where the observer looks through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. The maximum magnification of the eyepiece lens is typically 10x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Magnification Calculation**
    *   Total magnification is calculated by multiplying the objective lens magnification by the eyepiece lens magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. For example, a 10x eyepiece with a 100x objective yields a total magnification of 1000x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## Fluorescent Microscope

A fluorescent microscope, while similar in appearance to a light microscope, incorporates specialized components to utilize fluorescence for imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

### Key Features and Applications
*   **Dichroic Mirrors:** These mirrors are added to a light microscope to convert it into a fluorescent microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Light Source:** Fluorescent microscopes use **ultraviolet light** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   **Wavelength Conversion:** Dichroic mirrors convert short wavelengths of light into longer wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

### Fluorescent Stains in Microbiology
Fluorescent stains are crucial for [[key_staining_techniques_in_microbiology | diagnosing infections]] and [[types_of_staining_techniques_for_diagnosing_infections | studying various microorganisms]]:
*   **Tuberculosis (TB):** Aura-mine and Rhodamine stains are used for detecting *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **Malaria:** Acridine Orange is the fluorescent stain used for malaria parasites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   **Fungi:** Calco Fluor White is a fluorescent stain for [[staining_techniques_for_studying_fungi | fungi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Rhodanine is a stain for copper, seen in conditions like Wilson's Disease, and should not be confused with Rhodamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

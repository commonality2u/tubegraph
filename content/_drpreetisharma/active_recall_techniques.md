Active recall is a study method that involves actively testing oneself on learned material to enhance memory retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It is a key component of [[effective_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | effective revision techniques]] and [[exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## What is Active Recall?

Active recall means that after [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | reading, completing rapid revision, and reviewing notes and Q-banks]], a student needs to test themselves to see how much information they can recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This process allows individuals to assess their memory and identify areas needing further review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The active recall session can be structured as "fill in the blanks" exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Active Recall

The instructor, having personally studied this way, believes that [[pathology_study_techniques_and_mnemonics | asking oneself questions]] and completing "fill in the blanks" exercises significantly improves recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While active recall can make the learning process tougher initially due to the mental exercise required, it ultimately simplifies retaining information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

## Application in Study Sessions

Active recall sessions are designed to engage students by hiding information and requiring them to supply the missing details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This method applies across various subjects, including:
*   [[pathology_study_techniques_and_mnemonics | Pathology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   [[microbial_culture_techniques | Culture Media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   [[parasitology_learning_strategies | Parasitology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>

The instructor aims to incorporate 15 questions per session, formatted to encourage active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

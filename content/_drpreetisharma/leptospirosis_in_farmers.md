Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Leptospira* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. It belongs to the spirochete family, characterized by its spiral shape and distinctive hooked ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. The disease is also commonly referred to as Weil's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Symptoms often include fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches, which may be accompanied by mild vomiting and diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Transmission and Risk Factors
Leptospirosis is particularly prevalent among farmers due to its specific transmission cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. The bacteria are transmitted when rat urine contaminates rainy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This contaminated water then comes into contact with individuals working in rice fields or paddy fields, as these crops require significant water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Farmers often contract the bacterium through this environmental exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis involves culture testing and serological investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Culture
On culture, *Leptospira* can produce a distinctive "dinger's ring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This ring is typically observed when the culture is grown on EMJH media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Serological Testing
Serological tests are performed to detect antibodies against *Leptospira* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Common serological tests include the cold agglutination test, standard agglutination test, and microscopic agglutination test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

> [!QUESTION] Homework
> Which of the aforementioned agglutination tests is specifically used for *Leptospira* diagnosis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>

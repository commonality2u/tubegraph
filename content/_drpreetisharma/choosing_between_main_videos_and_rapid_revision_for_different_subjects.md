For students appearing for NEET PG on March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, the choice between referring to main videos and [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | rapid revision (RR)]] videos depends largely on prior preparation and the nature of the subject.

## General Guideline
If you have already studied 85-90% of a subject from any source, the advice is to opt for [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | rapid revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | Rapid revision]] is considered excellent for the last month of preparation, especially when complemented with practice questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

## Subjects Recommended for Main Videos
Even with the exam approaching, certain subjects benefit from detailed study through main videos due to their bulkiness, high question yield, or inherent difficulty:
*   **Final Year Subjects** (Medicine, Surgery, OBGY): These subjects are "deadly," "bulky," and yield a significant number of questions in every exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine)**: Many questions are asked from PSM, including "crooked" and "atypical" ones, for which [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | rapid revision]] alone might not provide sufficient in-depth information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Anatomy**: If a student is weak in anatomy, jumping directly to [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | rapid revision]] can be "further torture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Pharmacology**: If a student lacks confidence in pharmacology even after initial revision, main videos are recommended to overcome this "scare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
*   **Biochemistry and Microbiology**: These, along with anatomy and pharmacology, are often considered "nightmare subjects." For these, it's advised to pick them up from main videos to eliminate the fear associated with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

## Subjects Recommended for Rapid Revision
[[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | Rapid revision]] is suitable for:
*   **Pathology and Microbiology**: Daily targets will specifically focus on [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | rapid revision]] for these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Short Subjects**: [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | Rapid revision]] is ideal for quicker coverage of short subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Already Covered Subjects**: If a subject has been thoroughly studied using main videos or another comprehensive source, it's best to stick to that source for revision rather than switching to [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | rapid revision]] for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.

## Strategy for Interns
For interns, given the limited study time, the primary source should be [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | rapid revision]] coupled with question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:37">[02:28:37]</a>. They should prioritize finishing short subjects quickly during periods of lighter clinical duties, such as during "light postings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:01">[02:29:01]</a>.

## Important Considerations
*   **No Universal Rule**: There is no single timetable or strategy that works for everyone; customization is essential based on individual study patterns and strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:46">[02:46:46]</a>.
*   **Complementary Approach**: [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | Rapid revision]] notes should be used along with practicing 100-150 MCQs daily. The extra time allocated in the study plan is specifically for question practice, not just note-reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.
*   **Question Banks**: For bulky subjects (Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, Anatomy, PSM, Pharmacology), aim to cover the full question bank. For short subjects, the [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | rapid revision]] question bank might suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:33">[03:32:33]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects**: Subjects that are prone to being forgotten easily should be given special attention towards the end of the preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:31">[02:42:31]</a>.
*   **Mindset**: A positive mindset is crucial. Instead of focusing on past performance, concentrate on daily actions and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:06">[02:46:06]</a>.

Ultimately, the decision to use main videos or [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | rapid revision]] for a particular subject should be based on assessing your current understanding, confidence level, and the subject's importance, while always integrating MCQ practice for comprehensive [[exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:53">[03:57:53]</a>.

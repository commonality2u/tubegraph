This article focuses on strategies for students preparing for major exams, particularly in the final days leading up to the examination, emphasizing **[[managing_exam_day_stress_and_anxiety | anxiety and stress management]]** and effective study practices. The advice is specifically for FMG students with approximately 10 days remaining before their January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Strategies for the Last 10 Days Before Exams

The last 10 days before an exam are critical, often referred to as "make or break" time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The focus should be on specific "do's and don'ts" that can significantly impact performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Managing Unfinished Syllabus and New Topics
Most students will not have completed all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:46">[02:45:46]</a>.
It's crucial to:
*   **Avoid starting entirely new, large topics** in subjects you've already covered deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. For example, don't begin studying rare pathology topics if you've already covered the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Do not leave any subject untouched** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Even if you haven't studied a subject like orthopedics, anesthesia, or forensics, aim to know at least a little bit about every subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The goal is to be able to answer at least 50% of the questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   For subjects not thoroughly studied, utilize "Last Rapid Revision (LRR)" sessions (around 3 hours long) or crash courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This ensures basic coverage of all subjects.

### Prioritizing Sleep and Alertness
*   **Normalize your sleep cycle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Since the exam is during the day, ensure you are alert in the morning hours to solve questions with full attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Aim for a minimum of 6 to 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Avoid sleepless nights or trying new medications for sleep, as this can negatively impact performance on exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) and MCQ Practice
Whether to give a grand test in the last 9 days is a personal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Caution:** If you score low (e.g., below 150), it can cause significant panic and anxiety, hindering further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Focus on time management and silly mistakes**: If you do take a GT, do not focus on the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Instead, use it to practice [[time_management_and_study_scheduling | time management]] and identify areas where you make careless errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **MCQ practice is crucial**: Whether you give GTs or not, continue solving MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Aim for at least 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, gradually increasing the number if possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   **Reviewing MCQs:**
    *   If an MCQ is correct, do not read the explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   If an MCQ is wrong, superficially read the explanation to understand if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
    *   Do not get bogged down by new or "bouncer" questions (20-30 questions per GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Your pass/fail is determined by known topics and avoiding silly mistakes, not these difficult questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Focus on Previous Year Topics, Not Just Questions**: Memorizing answers to previous year questions (PYQs) is not enough, as questions are not copied verbatim anymore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Focus on understanding the underlying topics from which PYQs are derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

## [[managing_exam_day_stress_and_anxiety | Managing Anxiety and Stress]]
[[overcoming_exam_anxiety_and_motivational_tips | Positivity]] is essential at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Talk only to people who give you positive vibes, like parents, siblings, or good friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Avoid negative influences**: Stay away from those who boast about their high scores or spread rumors about exam difficulty or pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Ignore all rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Mental stability**: Do not let negative thoughts enter your mind, as one wasted day due to negativity can set you back by two or three subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
*   **Don't overthink future scenarios**: Avoid worrying about practical issues on exam day, like alarms, reaching the center, or computer functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. Focus on the next few hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
*   **Accept forgetfulness**: It's normal to feel like you're forgetting subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. No one can memorize all 19 subjects perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. If you forget something, quickly revise it instead of falling into a negative cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## [[approach_to_final_exam_preparation | Study Plan and Time Management]]

### Subject Management
Divide subjects into three phases for efficient revision:
1.  **Short Subjects**: Head & Neck, Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensics, Skin, ENT, Ophthalmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Dedicate approximately 2.5 days to these 8 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Focus on LRR sessions and all previous year questions/topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
2.  **Giant & Volatile Subjects**: Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. These are often difficult to retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Again, focus on LRR sessions and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. For challenging subjects like pharmacology or microbiology, the mindset should be to read them once for the exam and never again, using LRR and PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
3.  **Clinical Subjects**: Medicine, Surgery, OBGYN, Pathology, Physiology, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. For these, also prioritize LRR videos and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Daily Schedule and [[time_management_and_study_hours_for_exams | Study Hours]]
Your day should be divided into four time slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>:
1.  **Study (Theory & MCQs)**: This will take up the majority of your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
    *   Aim for a minimum of 12-14 productive hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, meaning full concentration with no phone or distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
    *   Divide your study time with 60% on MCQs and 40% on theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. When doing MCQs, explanations often cover theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
    *   Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch with the same attention and alertness, mirroring the exam environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.
2.  **Images**: Dedicate one hour daily to quickly scan through images related to the subjects you studied that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
3.  **Sanity Time**: Allocate 30 minutes daily for personal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This could be a light walk, talking to friends, or engaging in a light activity away from books and phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This helps prevent mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
4.  **Sleep**: Ensure 6-8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

### [[time_management_and_revision_techniques | Revision Techniques]]
*   **Be a "scanning machine"**: Quickly review everything you've already read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Prioritize LRR and PYQs**: These are your main tools for quick and effective revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Focus on volatile subjects for last-day revision**: Identify subjects or topics you tend to forget easily (e.g., biochemistry cycles, microbiology catalysts, pharmacology drugs) and quickly review them on the last day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.

## Exam Day Mindset
*   **Expect varied difficulty**: One paper will likely be easy, and the other tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. Do not get demotivated by a difficult first paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.
*   **Avoid discussing Paper 1 during the break**: Disconnect from Paper 1 and jump into Paper 2 without lingering on the previous paper's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   **Overall pass score**: Your target is to cross 150 marks by combining scores from both papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

## Important Reminders
*   Do not experiment with new routines or medications just before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   The goal is to pass the exam, not become a PhD in every subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   For students consistently scoring 170-190+ in Grand Tests, continue with your current strategy as it's working well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   If you're stuck at 130-150 in GTs, quickly analyze your mistakes (silly mistakes vs. knowledge gaps) and adjust your study plan accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.
*   Focus on the present: "What do I have to do in the next three hours?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>, rather than future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.
*   Remember, competitive exams are a blend of knowledge and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Your mental stability and approach on exam day are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

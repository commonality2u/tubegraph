Preparing for the FMGE requires a structured approach to [[time_management_and_study_techniques_for_fmge | time management]] and a well-defined study schedule, especially given the approximate three-month timeframe for the December exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. This article outlines a comprehensive strategy to maximize your preparation efficiency.

## Daily Study Hours

A dedicated effort of 12 to 14 hours of study per day is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. This doesn't mean just sitting with books, but actively engaging with the material during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

## Study Approach: Rapid Revision Focus

To cover the syllabus within 45 to 50 days, relying solely on main videos for all subjects is not practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. The primary focus should be on **rapid revision** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

*   **Selective Main Video Use**: If you encounter a concept during rapid revision that you don't understand, only then should you refer to the main video for that specific concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   **Key Subjects for Main Videos**: For subjects like Obstetrics & Gynaecology (OBG) and Preventive and Social Medicine (PSM), which have a high weightage (40+ questions each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>, consider doing their main videos if time permits, especially if you felt weak in them during previous attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects**: Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Microbiology are volatile subjects that are easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. For these, consistently read rapid revision notes multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>. The rapid revision for Pathology and Microbiology is 100% sufficient for the FMGE and NEET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>.
*   **Medicine**: Instead of tackling medicine in one long stretch, dedicate one hour to it every day as a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>. This ensures consistent progress and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>.

## Question Practice (MCQs/PYQs)

*   **Simultaneous Practice**: It is crucial to practice MCQs side-by-side with your theoretical study, preferably topic-wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
*   **Source of Questions**:
    *   For textbook-based questions, FMGE solutions are a good source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
    *   For app-based questions, use platforms like Prepladder, which also include previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Question Bank**: Prioritize clinical question banks as they prepare you for the lengthy and clinical questions now seen in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. These also help with [[time_management_and_study_techniques_for_fmge | time management]] during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   **Number of Questions**: Aim to solve between 100 to 150 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:45:00">[35:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:03:00">[36:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:34:00">[36:34:00]</a>. Start with fewer (e.g., 50 questions) and gradually increase by 5-7 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:30:00">[36:30:00]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**:
    *   Do the last 5 years of FMGE papers (10 sessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:48:00">[32:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:52:00">[32:52:00]</a>.
    *   Do at least the last 3 years of NEET PG PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>. If possible, extend to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:15:00">[33:15:00]</a>.
    *   PYQs help identify frequently asked topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

## Revision Strategy

*   **Notes-Based Revision**: Once the syllabus is completed, revision should primarily be done from your notes, not by re-watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:00">[30:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>. Videos should only be opened if a concept is completely forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>.
*   **Active Recall**: Practice active recall by asking yourself questions, covering answers, and recalling information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>. If studying with a partner, ask each other questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>. This builds confidence, unlike passive learning (listening to videos or lectures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>.
*   **Bookmark Selectively**: When practicing questions, bookmark only those that you genuinely forget or find particularly challenging. Avoid bookmarking too many, as it becomes impractical to review them all later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[30:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>.
*   **Screenshot Management**: If taking screenshots of important information, create a dedicated folder and categorize them by subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>. Avoid taking excessive screenshots, as they often go unreviewed and are eventually deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:00">[31:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:17:00">[32:17:00]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

*   **Baseline GT**: Take a Grand Test at the beginning of your preparation (e.g., today, September 2nd) to establish a baseline score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.
*   **Gradual Improvement**: Aim for gradual improvement in GT scores, not massive jumps overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a>. Target an increase of at least 10 marks in every subsequent GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.
*   **Analyze Performance**: After each GT, analyze your performance to identify weak subjects or areas where you dropped marks (e.g., OBG, Pathology, PSM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:42:00">[38:42:00]</a>. Focus your revision on these identified weak spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:33:00">[38:33:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Pressure**: Do not put unnecessary pressure on yourself to score 150+ in the first GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. Scores will gradually increase over the three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

## Study Schedule and Timetable

*   **46-Day Plan**: A 46-day timetable is proposed for the initial syllabus completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>.
*   **Customization**: You can customize the order of subjects in your [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | timetable]] based on your strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>.
    *   Prioritize subjects that you found difficult in previous attempts (e.g., OBG, Pathology, PSM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>.
*   **Backlog Management**: It's normal to have backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. Don't blame yourself; aiming to complete 80-85% of your daily [[daily_routine_for_effective_fmge_preparation | daily routine]] is good enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. No one finishes 100% of their timetable every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.
*   **Offline Coaching**: If attending offline coaching, follow their timetable. However, ensure you revise the content learned each day before the next class to avoid backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>.

## Mindset and Motivation

*   **Overcoming Trauma**: Acknowledge and overcome any trauma from past exam results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
*   **Positive Attitude**: Study with a positive mindset and a smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>.
*   **Set Clear Goals**: Write down your desired score (e.g., 151+) and your purpose for studying (e.g., for family, dreams, license) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:30:00">[41:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:42:00">[41:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:00">[42:06:00]</a>. Keep this visible as a daily reminder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:26:00">[42:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace Challenges**: Failures are a part of life and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08:00">[43:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>. The December exam cannot be tougher than what many experienced in July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:39:00">[45:39:00]</a>.
*   **Stay Consistent**: Dedication and discipline are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. Avoid skipping study days, even for a single hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.
*   **Stick to Your Sources**: Do not change your study platform or notes at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>. Stick to what you have already read and made standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:13:00">[35:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>. Incremental updates (1-2 pages) can be added, but a complete change is not advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:41:00">[44:41:00]</a>.
*   **"It's not over until you win"**: Keep this motto in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:42:00">[43:42:00]</a>.

This guide provides an overview of recommended resources and strategies for [[pathology_residency_orientation_and_resources | Pathology residency]], focusing on histology and hematology, as discussed in an introductory session for pathologists and residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It addresses [[pathology_exam_preparation_tips | exam preparation tips]], effective study methods, and available tools.

## General Study Approach for Pathology Residents

For first-year residents, it's crucial to focus on normal [[histological_and_cytological_appearances_in_pathology | histology]] and hematology before delving into pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

When choosing textbooks, it is advisable to read one chapter from different recommended books and compare them to find what suits individual learning styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. All books generally provide the same information, but the presentation varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

For [[histological_and_cytological_appearances_in_pathology | slide discussion]] and [[pathology_image_identification_and_key_concepts | image identification]], utilize online resources like Google or YouTube to get accustomed to viewing different [[histological_and_cytological_appearances_in_pathology | morphologies]] when physical slides are unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. A key tip for viewing slides is to develop the habit of observing at low power (4x or 10x) first, as 80% of pathology diagnoses are made at these magnifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Recommended Books

The following books are recommended for residency study and for the content being integrated into a new pathology residency app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>:

*   **Robbins**: Considered the starting point for theoretical pathology, including general and systemic pathology, and hematology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Ackerman**: Recommended for [[histological_and_cytological_appearances_in_pathology | histopathology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Fletcher**: Recommended for tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **Sternberg**: Also mentioned as a common reference, though the speaker personally prefers Ackerman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Histology Resources

For normal [[histological_and_cytological_appearances_in_pathology | histology]], *Veters* is a personally preferred book due to its user-friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Hematology Resources

For hematology, the following are suggested:
*   *Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **WHO classifications**: Primarily useful for leukemias and lymphomas, and also for updates on classifications like AML and MDS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   *Vanes* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   Dr. T.J. Singh's book: Recommended for absolute beginners to understand basic cell [[histological_and_cytological_appearances_in_pathology | morphology]] like neutrophils and RBCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Transfusion Medicine/Blood Banking

For transfusion medicine and blood banking, *Makroo's* book is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. It provides case studies and covers basic blood groups to advanced topics like APS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)

For FNAC (FNA/C), *Orell's Cytopathology* is the referred book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Its content is integrated into systemic pathology topics within the residency app where relevant, such as for thyroid, salivary gland, and breast FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## Pathology Residency App

A new [[pathology_residency_orientation_and_resources | Pathology residency]] app is being developed in collaboration with PrepLadder, slated for launch around May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This app will be solely dedicated to pathology content and will integrate information from various key textbooks.

The app's content will include:
*   Entire Robbins (General, Systemic, and Hematology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   Systemic pathology with added pointers, buzzwords, keywords, and differential diagnoses from Fletcher and Ackerman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   Hematology basics from multiple sources and Robbins, with integrated WHO updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   Transfusion medicine/Blood Banking (based on Makroo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   Clinical Pathology topics such as urine and stool examination, and semen analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   Basic biochemistry principles like KFT and LFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   Practical aspects like the histopathology processor and staining techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

## Continuous Learning and Community Engagement

A dedicated Telegram group for [[pathology_residency_orientation_and_resources | Pathology residency]] has been created to foster continuous learning and interaction among residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This group will feature [[pathology_image_identification_and_key_concepts | slide and morphology discussion]] sessions, along with YouTube sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Interesting cases from daily practice and important information for residents will be posted, along with quick questions and audio descriptions to aid in [[discussion_of_medical_content_like_microscopy_and_classifications | microscopy]] and viva preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

Residents are encouraged to actively engage by reading recent articles and journals to stay updated on new immunohistochemical markers and genetic analysis advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. Specific journal and website links will be shared on the Telegram group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

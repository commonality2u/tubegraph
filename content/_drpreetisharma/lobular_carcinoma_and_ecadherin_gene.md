[[Breast Pathology | Lobular carcinoma]] is a type of breast cancer characterized by distinct pathological features and a specific genetic alteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A patient with lobular carcinoma, such as a 58-year-old woman, may present with irregular nodularity in the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Mammography can reveal irregular densities in one or both breasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Pathological Features
Upon needle biopsy, the histology reveals tumor cells arranged in a classical "Indian file pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This means the tumor cells are aligned one behind the other, similar to disciplined army men in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

Lobular carcinoma can sometimes manifest as a premalignant condition (lobular carcinoma in situ) without a proper lump, presenting as irregular densities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This cancer can also be bilateral and multicentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Genetic Basis
The occurrence of [[Breast Cancer and Genetic Alterations | lobular carcinoma]] is linked to the downregulation of the E-cadherin protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This protein is encoded by the **CDH1 gene**, which is defective in cases of lobular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

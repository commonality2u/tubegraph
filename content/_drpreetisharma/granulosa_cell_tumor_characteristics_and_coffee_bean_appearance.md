Granulosa cell tumor is a type of ovarian tumor commonly observed in post-menopausal women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Patients typically present with symptoms such as bleeding per vaginum and a bulky uterus, which are indicative of hyperestrogenism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Pathogenesis
The underlying cause of granulosa cell tumor is the *FOXL2* gene mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This mutation leads to elevated estrogen levels in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Microscopic Features
Microscopically, granulosa cell tumors exhibit characteristic features:

*   **Call-Exner Bodies**
    These are classical findings, appearing as tumor cells arranged in a round fashion with pink material in their center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

*   **Nuclear Grooves ("Coffee Bean" Appearance)**
    The tumor cells commonly show nuclear grooves, which give them a distinctive "coffee bean" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Tumor Markers
Granulosa cell tumors are typically positive for the tumor marker inhibin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. They are also positive for CD99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis
Besides granulosa cell tumor, another [[ovarian_tumors_and_pathology|ovarian tumor]] that can exhibit the "coffee bean" appearance is the Brenner tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

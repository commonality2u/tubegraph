Filarial infections are caused by parasitic worms known as filariae. These infections are diagnosed based on the presence of microfilariae in blood investigations, often differentiated by their morphological characteristics and clinical manifestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49">[02:49]</a>.

## Sheathed Microfilariae

When a [[Parasitic Organisms and Their Characteristics | sheathed microfilaria]] is observed, it typically points to one of three organisms: *Loa loa*, *Brugia malayi*, or *Wuchereria bancrofti* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[02:57]</a>. The sheath appears as an orange-colored layer around the filaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[03:22]</a>. Differentiation among these three is based on the presence and arrangement of nuclei at the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30">[03:30]</a>.

### *Wuchereria bancrofti*

*   **Morphology**: No nuclei are present at the tail tip, as if they have "vanished like magic" ("whoosh") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50">[03:50]</a>. The nuclei end before the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46">[03:46]</a>.
*   **Clinical Manifestations**:
    *   **Elephantiasis**: A classical sign, characterized by a swollen limb due to obstruction of lymphatics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44">[04:44]</a>.
    *   **Chyluria**: If lymphatic channels burst due to obstruction, lymph fluid can come out into the urine, making it appear milky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02">[05:02]</a>.

### *Brugia malayi*

*   **Morphology**: Characterized by the presence of two nuclei at the tail tip ("by" reminds of "two") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58">[03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02">[04:02]</a>.

### *Loa loa*

*   **Morphology**: Features a continuous "line of nuclei" that extends right till the end of the tail tip ("L for L") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07">[04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[04:11]</a>.
*   **Clinical Manifestations**:
    *   **African Eye Worm**: The worm can be visibly seen in the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23">[06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28">[06:28]</a>.
    *   **Calabar Swelling**: A swelling in the hands, representing a hypersensitivity reaction to the *Loa loa* parasite, characterized by swelling and redness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38">[06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41">[06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50">[06:50]</a>.

## Unsheathed Microfilariae

### *Onchocerca volvulus*

*   **Morphology**: This microfilaria is unsheathed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>.
*   **Clinical Manifestations**:
    *   **Leopard Skin or Dermatitis**: Causes severe darkening of the skin, resembling a "leopard skin" appearance, often seen in the black population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36">[05:36]</a>.
    *   **River Blindness (Sclerosing Keratitis)**: A common cause of blindness, characterized by the eye appearing to be entirely covered by a sheath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56">[05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07">[06:07]</a>.
*   **Vector**: Transmitted by black flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45">[05:45]</a>.
*   **Treatment**: The drug of choice for river blindness is [[Parasitic Organisms and Their Characteristics | Ivermectin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11">[06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15">[06:15]</a>.

## Pre-Exam Evening Checklist

On the evening before the exam, it is crucial to wind down and prepare logistically and mentally.
*   **Wrap-up Studies:** Conclude all studying by 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Rest:** Settle down, ease yourself, and prioritize a good night's sleep, as it is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.
*   **[[lastminute_exam_checklist | Document Checklist]]:** Ensure your admit card is ready and a valid ID proof is prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>. Double-check that the name on your ID matches the name on your admit card without any spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. Remember, you do not need to paste a photograph on the admit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. Keep your ID in an easily accessible place to avoid misplacing it in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>.
*   **Locate Exam Center:** Confirm the exact location of your exam center in advance, rather than leaving it for the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:07">[01:51:07]</a>.
*   **Last-Minute Review (Optional):** If you have a personal list of volatile topics, review that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:08">[03:47:08]</a>. If not, scan through images from subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Orthopedics, and Radiology, as they often feature classical spotter images that can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:06">[03:53:06]</a>. Do not try to read new, extensive subjects like Medicine in the last few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:04">[20:55:04]</a>.

## Exam Day Logistics and Mindset

Approaching the exam hall with a calm and confident demeanor is vital.
*   **Timely Arrival:** Entry for Paper 1 begins at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>. Arrive well in advance to allow time for your heart rate to normalize before the exam starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   **Maintain Confidence:** Be *super confident* until you sit down in front of the computer screen in the exam hall (around 8:30 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:07">[17:54:07]</a>. Believe your preparation, strategy, teachers, and sources were the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:07">[17:43:07]</a>. This confidence helps you reach the hall effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:07">[18:59:07]</a>.

## During the Exam: Strategy & Mindset

Your approach during the exam can significantly impact your performance.
*   **Switch On/Switch Off Mode:** For each question, adopt a "switch on" approach to focus solely on that question, and then "switch off" from it before moving to the next. Do not dwell on past questions or anticipate future ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:07">[05:38:07]</a>.
*   **No Negative Marking:** Since there is no negative marking, attempt every question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:06">[05:55:06]</a>.
*   **Balance of Difficulty:** Expect one paper to be relatively easy and the other to be more difficult, maintaining a balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:07">[04:32:07]</a>. Do not get discouraged if one paper seems tough; it's part of the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:07">[04:57:07]</a>.
*   **Handling "Bouncer" Questions:** Approximately 10-20 questions in each paper might be "bouncers"—questions that are very difficult, obscure, or from unexpected sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:07">[06:15:07]</a>. These are not designed for everyone to solve and focusing on them is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:07">[06:40:07]</a>. Don't let them deter your [[managing_exam_anxiety_and_stress | motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:07">[07:01:07]</a>. Simply mark an answer (e.g., A, B, C, or D), smile, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:07">[07:30:07]</a>. These questions are a challenge for everyone, including toppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:07">[07:39:07]</a>.
*   **Avoid Silly Mistakes:** Focus on not making silly mistakes on easier questions, as these are more regrettable than missed difficult ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:07">[07:52:07]</a>. Silly mistakes are more likely if you carry negativity or panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>. Accept that some human error is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:07">[11:46:07]</a>.
*   **Time Management:**
    *   Some questions will be one-liners and quick, while others will be lengthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:07">[19:28:07]</a>. Do not stress if a lengthy question takes more than the typical 50 seconds; other questions will balance this out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:07">[19:38:07]</a>.
    *   In the first 15 minutes, it's normal for your speed to be slower as you settle in. Do not worry if you solve fewer questions initially; you will pick up pace later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:07">[19:56:07]</a>.
*   **Reading Questions Carefully:** Even if a question seems familiar or straightforward, read the entire question and all options carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:07">[18:30:07]</a>. A small twist in the question can change the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:07">[18:48:07]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut Feeling:** Do not overthink. Your first gut feeling or intuition is often correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:07">[11:02:07]</a> and should be trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:07">[17:11:07]</a>. Avoid changing many answers in the last 15 minutes due to panic, as this often leads to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:07">[16:54:07]</a>.

## Between Papers

*   **Avoid Discussion:** Do not discuss Paper 1 with anyone between sessions, especially not through messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>. Hearing about questions you might have missed or answered incorrectly can demotivate you and negatively impact your performance on Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:07">[02:52:07]</a>.
*   **Refuel:** Eat or drink something light and energy-giving during the break to prepare for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:07">[03:28:07]</a>.

## Maintaining a Positive Mindset

A positive mindset is crucial for [[managing_exam_anxiety_and_stress | managing exam anxiety and stress]] and optimal performance.
*   **Cultivate Positivity:** From now until the end of the exam, focus only on positive thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:07">[09:53:07]</a>. You can reflect on negative things after 4:30 PM or 5:00 PM the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:07">[10:02:07]</a>.
*   **Count Your Blessings:** Remind yourself of your hard work and the support you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:07">[08:57:07]</a>. Believe that nothing bad can happen, and tomorrow is your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:07">[09:07:07]</a>. This helps normalize your heart rate and reduce silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:07">[09:10:07]</a>.
*   **Combat Self-Doubt:** Many students experience self-doubt, feeling they haven't studied enough or forgotten everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:07">[10:17:07]</a>. Believe in yourself and your preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:07">[10:34:07]</a>. Often, your first instinct in a low-pressure situation is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:07">[10:58:07]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Pass Mark:** Aim to cross the bare minimum of 150 marks for the exam; every mark above that is a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:07">[11:14:07]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Faith/Beliefs:** Lean on whatever gives you faith—God, the universe, energy, or the blessings of your parents and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:07">[08:42:07]</a>. This provides a sense of security and helps ward off negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:07">[12:36:07]</a>.
*   **Ignore External Judgement:** Do not worry about what others who are not part of your journey might think if you don't clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:07">[14:29:07]</a>. Your true supporters (teachers, parents) know your hard work and will stand by you regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:07">[14:06:07]</a>. There is more to life than just one exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:07">[14:43:07]</a>.

## Final Encouragement

*   You are already doctors in practice; the exam is a formality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:07">[22:14:07]</a>. This five-line MCQ is a small challenge compared to saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:07">[22:33:07]</a>.
*   Be confident, smile, and take every question as a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:07">[21:58:07]</a>.
*   Your worth is not defined by this piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:07">[23:47:07]</a>. You have worked hard and are doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:07">[23:52:07]</a>.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of certain neoplasias, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, through its interaction with the host cell's tumor suppressor genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:53">[08:51:53]</a>.

## Role of HPV in Neoplasia

HPV contributes to the development of neoplasia by inactivating tumor suppressor genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:53">[08:51:53]</a>. Specifically, HPV proteins target and "switch off" key regulatory proteins in the cell, leading to uncontrolled cell growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

## Key Viral Proteins and Their Mechanism

Two main HPV proteins responsible for oncogenesis are E6 and E7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. These proteins interact with the host's tumor suppressor genes:
*   **E6 protein** inactivates p53, often referred to as the "policeman" of the cell, which normally regulates cell growth and apoptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:33">[12:30:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:55">[12:52:55]</a>.
*   **E7 protein** inactivates the retinoblastoma (RB) gene, known as the "governor" protein, which controls cell cycle progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:38">[12:35:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:58">[12:55:58]</a>.

By inactivating these crucial tumor suppressor genes, HPV promotes cellular proliferation and the accumulation of genetic mutations, leading to neoplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.

Other HPV proteins:
*   **L1 protein** is the capsid protein from which HPV vaccines are formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.
*   **E4 and E5 proteins** are associated with the characteristic histological features seen in HPV infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

## Histological Features: [[Visual and histological pathology clues for diagnosis | Coilocytes]]

A key [[Visual and histological pathology clues for diagnosis | histological feature]] associated with HPV infection, particularly seen in Pap smears, is the presence of [[Visual and histological pathology clues for diagnosis | coilocytes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. These cells exhibit specific characteristics:
*   **Raisinoid nucleus**: A nucleus that appears shrunken or "raisin-like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
*   **Perinuclear halo**: A clear, white area surrounding the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.
This morphology is linked to the E4 and E5 HPV proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

## High-Risk HPV Types

Certain HPV types are considered high-risk due to their increased association with squamous cell carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. HPV 16 and HPV 18 are notable examples of these high-risk viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

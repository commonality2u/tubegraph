The string test is a diagnostic procedure primarily used to identify *Giardia lamblia* infection, particularly when routine stool examinations do not reveal trophozoites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Purpose and Procedure
The string test is performed to diagnose small intestinal infections, specifically by collecting duodenal contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

The procedure involves:
*   The patient ingests a capsule containing a string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   The capsule travels down to the duodenum, where *Giardia lamblia* typically resides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   One end of the string remains outside the patient's mouth, secured with tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   After a period, the string is pulled out, bringing with it duodenal contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   These contents adhering to the string are then examined under a microscope to detect *Giardia lamblia* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Clinical Context
A patient presenting with persistent watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and dehydration, where stool examination fails to show trophozoites, might undergo a string test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Distinction from Other String Tests
While the string test described above is performed on patients, there are other "string tests" conducted in a [[microbiological_test_for_detection | microbiology lab]] on cultures or plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. These include:
*   A string test for *Vibrio cholera* (associated with rice water stools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   A string test for *Klebsiella pneumoniae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

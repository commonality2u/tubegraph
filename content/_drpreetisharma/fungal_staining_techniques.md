Fungal staining is a crucial aspect of [[Microbiology Crash Course | mycology]], essential for identifying different fungal types and etiologies, especially when studying [[Microbial culture techniques | culture morphology]] or tissue samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Various stains are employed, each revealing distinct characteristics of fungal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Common Fungal Stains and Their Applications

### Lactophenol Cotton Blue (LPCB)
LPCB is the best stain for studying [[Microbial culture techniques | culture morphology]] of fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. When used, fungal elements appear blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This stain is commonly applied to specimens grown on fungal media like Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA) to observe their microscopic morphology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Gomori Methenamine Silver (GMS) Stain
The GMS stain causes fungal hyphae to appear black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. A helpful mnemonic is that any stain containing "silver" will typically result in a blackish color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Application**: Used for various fungi, including *Blastomyces* where broad-based budding appears black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, and *Paracoccidioidomycosis* showing a black "mickey mouse" or "mariner wheel" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. It is also the *only* stain that can effectively stain *Pneumocystis jirovecii* (formerly *Pneumocystis carinii*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>.

### Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) Stain
The PAS stain makes fungal hyphae appear pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Calcofluor White (CFW) Stain
CFW is a fluorescent dye that makes fungal elements appear fluorescent against a dark background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### India Ink Stain (Negative Stain)
India Ink is a negative stain where the background is colored, but the organisms themselves remain unstained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Application**: Primarily used for Cryptococcus, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with cryptococcal meningitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Mucicarmine Stain
Mucicarmine stain causes *Cryptococcus* to appear rose pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Application**: Used for biopsy specimens of *Cryptococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) Mount
A 10% KOH mount is used for samples containing keratin, such as skin, hair, and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. KOH digests the keratin, allowing the fungal elements to become visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.
*   **Application**: Commonly used for *Malassezia furfur* (causing tinea versicolor), where it reveals a characteristic "spaghetti and meatball" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>. The "meatballs" are yeasts, and the "spaghetti" are long hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

## Specific Fungal Identification Features

### Cryptococcus
*   **Meningitis Samples (CSF)**: Identified using India Ink stain, which highlights the capsule as a clear halo against a dark background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Biopsy Samples**: Identified using Mucicarmine stain, turning the organism rose pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Aspergillosis vs. Mucormycosis
[[Microscopy and image identification techniques | Microscopic examination]] using stains like PAS can differentiate these two important fungal infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>:
*   **Aspergillosis**: Characterized by narrow-angled (acute angle) septate hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. The hyphae are typically thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.
*   **Mucormycosis**: Shows perpendicular (90-degree) branching, non-septate hyphae that are broad and ribbon-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

### Malassezia furfur
Causes tinea versicolor, appearing as hypopigmented lesions on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>. Microscopic examination with KOH mount shows "spaghetti and meatball" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>. It is a lipophilic (fat-loving) organism and requires olive oil supplementation in Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA) for culture, producing a "fried egg" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

### Dermatophytes
[[Laboratory techniques for identifying bacterial pathogens | Dermatophytes]] (Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton) primarily involve the skin, hair, and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. They are differentiated based on their macroconidia and microconidia morphology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>. LPCB staining is used to observe their conidia shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.
*   **Trichophyton**: Contains abundant microconidia and pencil-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>. Affects skin, hair, and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.
*   **Microsporum**: Contains fewer microconidia and spindle-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. Primarily affects skin and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.
*   **Epidermophyton**: Contains few to no microconidia and club-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. Primarily affects skin and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.

For students targeting NEET PG 2025, creating a study timetable is crucial, especially given the current uncertainties regarding the exam date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While the exact date is unknown, it's essential to make a plan that feels comfortable and allows for completion of the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A final, definitive timetable can be created closer to the exam date once clarity emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Proposed 65-Day Study Plan

A 65-day plan is suggested, designed to be comfortable for all students, whether they have taken a drop year or are currently interning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Customization for Interns and Working Doctors

Interns and working doctors should extend the proposed timeline:
*   Add 2 to 3 extra days per long subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Add 1 extra day for short subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   [[recommended_study_resources_and_video_lectures | Rapid revision]] videos are highly recommended as completing main videos might be nearly impossible without dedicating 12 hours daily to study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. If a topic in rapid revision is unclear, consult the corresponding main video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.
*   The timetable needs to be customized based on individual work schedules and available time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

### Subject Allocation Overview

The 65-day plan balances subjects, including occasional Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Anatomy: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
*   ENT: 3 days (due to increasing difficulty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>
*   Pathology: 5 days (rapid revision recommended for 20 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
*   Microbiology: 4 days (rapid revision recommended for 15 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
*   PSM: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days (includes GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
*   OBGY: 6 days (first read needs to be extensive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   Ophthalmology (OFA): 3 days (neuro-ophthalmology is challenging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
*   Pharmacology: 5 days (includes GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
*   Physiology: 2 days (recommended to study later as it covers other subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>

### Integrating Medicine and Daily Practice

Instead of blocking out a large chunk of time for medicine, integrate it daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Dedicate 1 to 1.5 hours to medicine videos daily, treating it like a clinical posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This approach makes the subject less overwhelming and allows for continuous integration with other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

A typical day should include:
*   **Morning (1 hour):** Dedicated to MCQs using a custom module. Start with questions from completed subjects and gradually add more as you progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Night (1 hour):** Fixed time for medicine, like reading a novel to detox before sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   Maintain discipline to stick to these fixed slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## Key Principles for Effective Study Planning

### The "20th Notebook" for Volatile Topics
Create a separate notebook (or "chy copy") specifically for volatile topics and Grand Test mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   This notebook should **only contain topic names** and references to where to read them, not entire text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   It must be **self-made** because everyone forgets different things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   This condensed list will be invaluable for the last 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Subject-Wise vs. System-Wise Study
*   For first-time learners or interns, a subject-wise approach (as outlined in the 65-day plan) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This prevents scattering of general topics (e.g., General Pathology, General Microbiology, General Pharmacology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   System-wise study is more suitable for second, third, or fourth revisions after the entire syllabus has been covered at least once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) and Analysis
*   Three Grand Tests are suggested within the initial 65-day plan for students not yet comfortable with their syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   For those in a more comfortable position, aim for one GT every 15 days, or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   GTs are primarily a guide for identifying weaker subjects and areas, not just for scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
*   **GT Analysis Strategy**:
    1.  Analyze incorrect answers first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
    2.  Review questions where you were confused between options or made an educated guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.
    3.  For correct answers, quickly scan the explanations to ensure understanding without spending excessive time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   Analyze subject-wise performance (e.g., if you're getting pathology questions wrong despite watching videos, deep dive into specific topics within pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
*   If GT scores aren't improving, consider increasing the number of daily MCQs (e.g., from 40 to 60 or 80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges

### The Discipline of Following a Timetable
*   Making a timetable is easy; consistently following it is the real challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   Avoid the habit of making a new timetable every day due to backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   Discipline comes from willpower; resist hitting the snooze button and prioritize your study blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Practice [[time_management_and_study_planning_for_exams | timeboxing]], allocating specific times for studies, internship, social media, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Managing Mental Health and Motivation
*   Prioritize health (physical and mental) above exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Mental exhaustion is not desired, especially without a deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   To [[handling_setbacks_and_maintaining_motivation_in_exam_preparation | overcome GT fear]], face it by giving tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. It's better to make mistakes and fail in mock tests now than in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   Don't focus on the GT score itself, but on the analysis of what went wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. The score is a byproduct of the right approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.
*   If the term "Grand Test" causes anxiety, rename it to "Custom Module Practice Question Module" to reduce pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

### Active vs. Passive Learning
*   Videos are for initial understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. Once understood, focus on active recall through notes and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.
*   Repeatedly watching videos can lead to overconfidence without true knowledge retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.
*   To memorize subjects like biochemistry, pharmacology, or microbiology, engage in active recall, such as covering notes and self-testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

## Starting the Plan
*   Begin today, not tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
*   Even if you can only manage 2-3 hours, start with decluttering your study area and organizing your notes and books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>. This prepares you for a focused start the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.
*   Have faith in your notes and question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. Sticking to one primary platform for notes and videos is usually sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.

Granulosa cell tumors are a type of ovarian tumor commonly observed in post-menopausal women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">00:06:07</a>, often referred to as "granny" tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">00:06:50</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A typical presentation involves a 54-year-old female experiencing bleeding per vaginum in the post-menopausal phase, which is unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">00:05:49</a>. Ultrasound findings may reveal a bulky uterus with an adnexal mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">00:05:55</a>. The bleeding and uterine bulkiness are attributed to elevated estrogen levels caused by the tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">00:06:30</a>.

## Genetic Basis
Granulosa cell tumors are associated with a mutation in the FOXL2 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">00:06:12</a>. This mutation leads to an increase in estrogen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">00:06:44</a>.

## Associated Hormonal Effects
This tumor is characterized by [[Genital System and Ovarian Tumors | hyperestrogenism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">00:06:27</a>, meaning estrogen levels are elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">00:06:30</a>. This contrasts with hypoestrogenism, which is an incorrect association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">00:06:20</a>.

## Histological Features
Microscopically, granulosa cell tumors exhibit several distinct features:
*   **Call-Exner bodies:** These are classical findings, appearing as tumor cells arranged in a round fashion with pink material in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">00:07:01</a>.
*   **Nuclear grooves (Coffee Bean Appearance):** When zoomed in, the cells show a line going through their nuclei, resembling a "coffee bean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">00:07:17</a>.

## Tumor Markers
Granulosa cell tumors are positive for:
*   Inhibin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">00:07:29</a>
*   CD99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">00:07:31</a>

## Differential Diagnosis
Another ovarian tumor that can exhibit the "coffee bean appearance" similar to granulosa cell tumors is a Brenner tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">00:07:51</a>.

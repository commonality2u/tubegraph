Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a condition characterized by a positive catalase test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Pathophysiology
The fundamental defect in CGD is a deficiency of NADPH oxidase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This deficiency impairs the body's ability to produce reactive oxygen species necessary to kill certain microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

### Genetics
CGD is associated with a *fox gene mutation* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. The inheritance pattern can be either X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **X-linked recessive** inheritance is linked to the GP91 *Fox mutation* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. A mnemonic to remember this is that 9 plus 1 equals 10, which resembles "X" (X-linked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
*   **Autosomal recessive** inheritance includes mutations in GP47, GP67, GP41, and GP61 *Fox genes* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

### Clinical Features
Patients with CGD experience recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. These infections are typically caused by catalase-positive organisms such as *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Candida* species, or *E. coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. A catalase-positive test result from a microbiological report should raise suspicion for CGD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

### Diagnostics in Pathology and Microbiology
Two primary tests are used for diagnosing CGD:
1.  **Screening Test**: The Nitroblue Tetrazolium (NBT) test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
2.  **Diagnostic Test**: Dihydro RHOdamine (DHR) testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

This article details the analysis of an [[Pathology and Microbiology Clinical MCQs | MCQ]] concerning intestinal biopsy findings, which was presented as the "[[Pathology and Microbiology Clinical MCQs | MCQ]] of the day" in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The daily series includes an "Image of the Day" (IOTD) and "MCQ of the Day" (MOTD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Case: Intestinal Biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>

A 14-year-old patient underwent an intestinal biopsy that revealed specific histopathological findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The [[Pathology Image Identification | image]] provided for the [[Pathology and Microbiology Clinical MCQs | MCQ]] was crucial for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

The question posed was: "Which of the following statements is incorrect about the condition?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>

### Options Presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   Intussusceptions are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   Autosomal dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
*   Gain of function of LKB1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
*   Most commonly affected site is jejunum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>

## Histopathological Findings and Analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>

The key finding in the intestinal biopsy [[Pathology image analysis | image]] was the presence of an [[Pathology image analysis | arborizing polyp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Arborizing Pattern:** This pattern is characterized by round epithelial glands with pinkish structures (muscle) going in between them, resembling branches of a tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Muscle Involvement:** Specifically, muscle tissue is seen extending into the polyp, splitting the glands like tree branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **"Christmas Tree Polyp":** This characteristic appearance also leads to it being referred to as a "[[visual_and_histological_pathology_clues_for_diagnosis | Christmas tree polyp]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>

Patients with this condition typically present with pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This includes cutaneous and oral/mucosal pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Diagnosis: Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>

The combination of pigmentation and the characteristic [[Pathology image analysis | arborizing]] or [[visual_and_histological_pathology_clues_for_diagnosis | Christmas tree polyp]] points to a diagnosis of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This is a type of [[visual_and_histological_pathology_clues_for_diagnosis | hamartomatous polyp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Salient Features of Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   **P for Pigmentation:** Characteristic mucosal and cutaneous pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **J for Jejunum:** The jejunum is the most common site for these polyps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Median Age of Presentation:** Approximately 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Gene Mutation:** The gene mutated is STK11 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 11) or LKB1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   It is a **loss of function** mutation of LKB1, not a gain of function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Complications:** These polyps commonly cause [[diagnostics_in_pathology_and_microbiology | intussusception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Inheritance:** The disease follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Answering the MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>

Based on the analysis, the incorrect statement among the given options is the "gain of function of LKB1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

> [!check] Correct Answer:
> The incorrect statement is that Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is caused by a **gain of function of LKB1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. It is, in fact, a **loss of function** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Summary of Correct Statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
*   [[diagnostics_in_pathology_and_microbiology | Intussusceptions]] are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   The most commonly affected site is the jejunum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Homework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>

For further revision, it is recommended to review the table of [[visual_and_histological_pathology_clues_for_diagnosis | hamartomatous polyps]] in Robbins or relevant notes, as this is a very important topic for examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

The [[image_of_the_day_series | Image of the Day series]] is an [[educational_resources_on_telegram_and_facebook | educational resource]] that combines an image of the day with an MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The series aims to reach and benefit users by providing concise, focused content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Availability
The series is widely available across multiple social media platforms, including:

This broad availability ensures accessibility for users on their preferred platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Structure and Content
The [[image_of_the_day_series | Image of the Day series]] is a short daily series that typically discusses one image and one MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Often, the image and MCQ are related to the same organ or pathological finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It emphasizes [[pathology_image_revision | pathology image revision]] and recognizing [[key_pathology_images_and_their_significance | key pathology images and their significance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Featured Cases
### Case 1: *Enterobius vermicularis* in the Appendix
The series featured a case involving the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The spotter image presented was of *Enterobius vermicularis*, also known as pinworm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

#### Histopathology
In histopathological images of *Enterobius vermicularis*, the key identifying feature is the presence of two lateral cuticular alae (projections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. These worms are often found in the lumen of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The appendix typically shows its characteristic dense lymphoid aggregate and goblet cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*Enterobius vermicularis* is frequently an incidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. While occasionally responsible for appendicitis, it is not a very common cause, and its classical clinical feature is perianal itching or pruritus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

#### Microbiology
The series also reviewed [[medical_imaging_in_pathology_and_microbiology | microbiology]] images of *Enterobius* eggs, which are classically described as plano-convex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Inside the egg, a tadpole larva can be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

The diagnostic technique for these eggs is the cellulose tape method or tape preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The eggs can appear differently under various staining methodologies:
*   Under ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   When stained with a Pap stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>

### Case 2: Acute Appendicitis vs. Peri-appendicitis (MCQ)
An MCQ was presented for a 17-year-old girl with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and an enlarged appendix, with histological features showing a dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate in the serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The question asked for the likely diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

The correct answer was acute salpingitis, leading to peri-appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

> [00:07:12] For making the diagnosis of acute appendicitis as a pathologist...I should see neutrophils...in the muscularis propria or the muscle layer not in any other layer.

*   **Acute Appendicitis**: Diagnosed when neutrophils (cells of acute inflammation) are seen specifically in the muscularis propria (muscle layer) of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Peri-appendicitis**: Diagnosed when inflammation, particularly neutrophilic infiltrate, is seen in the serosa (outer layer) of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This indicates inflammation surrounding the appendix that has extended onto it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. A common cause of peri-appendicitis in females is salpingitis (fallopian tube inflammation), which can extend to the appendix serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Perforation Appendix**: Would not show a proper muscle layer as it would be disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

The MCQ specifically highlighted inflammation in the serosa, pointing to peri-appendicitis rather than acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Learning Takeaways
The [[image_of_the_day_series | Image of the Day series]] emphasizes the [[importance_of_image_interpretation_in_pathology | importance of image interpretation in pathology]] and understanding precise diagnostic criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Recognizing [[microscopy_in_medical_education | microscopic]] features like the cuticular alae of *Enterobius vermicularis* and the specific layer of inflammation in appendicitis are crucial for accurate diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The series implicitly promotes [[effective_use_of_rapid_revision_and_main_video_resources | effective use of rapid revision]] by focusing on key concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

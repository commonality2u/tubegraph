This article provides an overview of pathology residency, focusing on the curriculum, recommended resources, and the realities of the profession, based on insights from an experienced pathologist and educator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This information is specifically for individuals enrolled in or considering pathology residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Speaker's Background

The speaker completed MBBS and MD from Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, spending 13 years there from 2007 to 2019, including senior residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Currently, the speaker works at a private lab in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Orienting to Residency

The discussion aims to orient new and current residents on what needs to be done from the first, second, and third years of residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It covers [[resources_and_study_strategies_for_pathology_residents | study resources]], [[paper_writing_and_research_in_pathology | paper writing]], and general advice for [[work_life_balance_and_daily_routine_during_pathology_residency | daily routine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Key Focus Areas for Pathology Residents

### For First-Year Residents

First-year residents, often referred to as "new kids on the block" or "babies," might initially struggle with basic tasks like adjusting a microscope or identifying cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
:bulb: **Initial Focus**: Before diving into pathology, concentrate on normal histology of different organs and normal hematology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

#### Recommended Books and [[resources_and_study_strategies_for_pathology_residents | Study Strategies]]

*   **Normal Histology**:
    *   *Wheater's* is personally preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
    *   Compare different books by reading a chapter from each to find what suits your learning style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   Utilize online resources like Google or YouTube for [[pathology_image_review | images]] if physical slides are unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Normal Hematology**:
    *   *Wintrobe's* is a good reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
    *   *WHO Classification of Tumours* is mainly for leukemia and lymphomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   *Vanes* is also helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   For absolute beginners, *Dr. T.J. Singh's book* can help understand basic cell morphology (e.g., neutrophil, RBC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **General and Systemic Pathology**:
    *   *Robbins* is considered the starting point for theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
    *   For histopathology, *Ackerman* is preferred, especially for tumors, alongside *Fletcher* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
    *   *Sternberg* is also a common choice, though not personally preferred by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Cytopathology (FNAC)**: *Orell's* is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Blood Banking/Transfusion Medicine**: *Makroo* is a good, concise book with cases and questions after each chapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

#### Approach to [[pathology_image_review | Slide Review]]

*   Overcome the obsession with 40x high power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   Most pathology diagnoses (80%) are made at 4x or 10x (low power) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   After viewing at high power, try to look at the same field at low power to develop a holistic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Pick up one topic a day based on the daily specimen load (e.g., lipoma, pleomorphic adenoma, breast cancer, GYN specimens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### [[Paper writing and research in pathology | Paper Writing and Research]]

Residents are encouraged to engage in [[paper_writing_and_research_in_pathology | research]] and publication:
*   **Original Articles**: These require significant effort and cumulative work (e.g., 6 years during PG and senior residency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. More time for this often becomes available during senior residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Case Reports**: Faster to write and don't always need to be "one in a million" cases; a series of 4-5 cases can be published to offer a new perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Reviews**: These are like writing a mini-book and are often undertaken during senior residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The speaker wrote a review on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis due to an interest in genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: The speaker pursued an online genetics course recently, highlighting the importance of upskilling in emerging fields like genomics and precision oncology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Pathology Residency App (PrepLadder)

An upcoming dedicated pathology residency app is being developed in collaboration with PrepLadder, tentatively launching around May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

### App Content Outline

*   **Robbins Integration**: Covers entire *Robbins* (General, Systemic, Hematology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. *Robbins* content is decoded into short notes, long questions, and viva questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   **Systemic Pathology**: Supplements *Robbins* with essential pointers, buzzwords, keywords, viva questions, and differential diagnoses from *Fletcher* and *Ackerman* for tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Cytopathology (FNAC)**: Relevant *Orell's* content is integrated, particularly for organs like thyroid, salivary gland, and breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **Hematology**: Starts with basics from multiple books and *Robbins*, integrating latest WHO updates (e.g., AML, MDS classifications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **Transfusion Medicine/Blood Banking**: Based on *Makroo*, covering topics from basic blood groups to APHAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Practical Aspects (Second Half of App)**: Will cover [[review_of_pathology_slides_and_exams | practical topics]] beyond just slides, including Clinical Pathology (urine, stool, semen analysis), basic biochemistry principles (KFT, LFT), histopathology processor workings, and a compilation of stains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

## Community and Interaction

Residents are encouraged to join a dedicated Telegram group for pathology residency, where the speaker will initiate [[pathology_image_review | slide]] and morphology discussions, post interesting cases, and answer queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Instagram is also available for general connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Realities and [[career_prospects_for_pathology_graduates | Career Prospects]] in Pathology

### Branch Acceptance and Perception

*   **Patient Interaction**: Pathology largely lacks direct patient interaction. If treating patients directly brings happiness, pathology might not be suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Pathologists act as a crucial backbone, making treatment possible, but often don't receive direct credit from patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
*   **Societal Perception**: Many non-medical individuals, including family and relatives, may not fully grasp the importance of paraclinical branches like pathology, often prioritizing clinical branches identified by a stethoscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Residents should be prepared for this disparity in understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

### [[career_prospects_for_pathology_graduates | Job Prospects]]

*   **Government Sector**: Jobs often involve a delay due to forms, applications, and state correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. A teaching experience (e.g., senior residency) of 3 years or more is typically required for government jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Private Sector**: Offers a huge spectrum depending on the state and whether one wants to open their own lab or work in an existing private lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.
    *   Opening a lab in saturated areas like central Delhi is difficult due to large chains and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
    *   Opening a lab in periphery areas can be more economical and practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Salary**: There's a wide range (e.g., 1 lakh to 3-4 lakhs per month) depending on expertise, experience, and practice location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. Additional fellowships in specializations (e.g., renal path) can increase pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Saturation**: Basic saturation exists in every medical branch, not just pathology, as many doctors prefer metropolitan cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. Ample jobs are available after obtaining an MD in pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

### [[work_life_balance_and_daily_routine_during_pathology_residency | Work-Life Balance and Daily Routine]]

*   **Residency vs. Post-Residency**: Pathology residency is often demanding and hectic, frequently requiring work until late evenings (7-8 PM, or even 10-12:30 AM in some hospitals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. This contrasts with the common misconception that it's a "chilled out" branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
    *   Example: Speaker worked 9 AM to 9 PM for 3 years, with departments open until 10-10:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.
    *   Clinical friends might leave by 4 PM, while pathology residents stay much later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
*   **Hectic Workload**: High patient influx and sample load, especially in prominent institutions like Tata or AIIMS Delhi, lead to very busy residencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
    *   Heavy workload during residency contributes to becoming a better pathologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
    *   Departments might have extensive academic activities (seminars, journal clubs, slide seminars), extending daily hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
    *   Grossing often continues until noon, with slide writing starting at 4 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.
*   **Post-Residency Work-Life Balance**: The desired 9-to-5 or 9-to-6:30 PM [[work_life_balance_and_daily_routine_during_pathology_residency | work-life balance]] is more achievable after residency, often in government or private medical colleges or private labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. In the "real pathology world," hematology and clinical pathology often form the core, with doctors working in shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

### Choosing a College/Hospital for Residency

*   **Personal Preference**: Consider the desired branch, state of residence, and [[work_life_balance_and_daily_routine_during_pathology_residency | work culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.
*   **Workload**: Tata Mumbai and AIIMS Delhi are known for very hectic work hours due to high patient and sample loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. Delhi colleges might offer slightly better work timings due to more residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.
*   **Academics**: If a department lacks strong academic activity, self-study is crucial. Continuously read *Robbins* and recent articles (e.g., one article per week) to stay updated on IHC markers, genetic analysis, and genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. First-year residents, often in grossing rooms, might find it hard to attend academic sessions actively, making personal study even more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>.

## Conclusion

Pathology residency is a challenging but rewarding phase. The initial struggle and hectic workload build a strong foundation for a successful career with potential for a better [[work_life_balance_and_daily_routine_during_pathology_residency | work-life balance]] later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>. Continuous learning and upskilling through courses and self-study are important after residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.

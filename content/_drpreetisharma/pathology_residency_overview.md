From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

This session aims to orient individuals currently enrolled in [[pathology_residency_challenges_and_worklife_balance | Pathology residency]] or working in the field, often referred to as "pink and blue" professionals [00:00:27]. It is the first live session specifically for pathologists [00:00:34].

## Speaker's Background
The speaker completed their MBBS and MD from Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, spending 13 years there from 2007 to 2019, including senior residency [00:01:51]. They now work with a private lab in Delhi [00:02:31].

## Residency Session Goals
The discussion is designed to:
*   Orient everyone who has taken up residency on what needs to be done from first, second, and third-year perspectives [00:01:02].
*   Provide information on [[recommended_study_resources_for_pathology_residents | recommended study resources]] [00:01:18].
*   Discuss the upcoming app for [[pathology_residency_challenges_and_worklife_balance | Pathology residency]] [00:01:21].
*   Address the importance of [[paper_writing_and_case_reports_in_pathology | paper writing]] [00:01:22].
The session is interactive, encouraging queries from residents and pathologists [00:01:30].

## [[paper_writing_and_case_reports_in_pathology | Paper Writing]] and [[paper_writing_and_case_reports_in_pathology | Case Reports]] in Residency
Based on the speaker's experience as a resident, it is important to focus on writing articles and case reports [00:03:08].
*   **Original Articles**: These require cumulative effort over several years, like the speaker's 6 years combining PG and Senior Residency (SShip) [00:03:22]. They don't happen overnight [00:03:30]. Senior residency often provides more time for this [00:03:45].
*   **Case Reports**: Writing [[paper_writing_and_case_reports_in_pathology | case reports]] is faster than original articles and requires less research [00:03:54]. They don't need to be "one in a million" cases; a series of four to five cases can also be compiled to offer a new perspective [00:04:07].
*   **Reviews**: These are like writing a mini-book and are often undertaken during senior residency [00:04:28]. The speaker's favorite review was on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, stemming from an interest in genetics [00:04:36].

The speaker also completed a rigorous 4-5 month online course in genetics recently, which covered genomics and precision oncology [00:05:01].

## [[recommended_study_resources_for_pathology_residents | Recommended Study Resources]] for First-Year Residents
First-year residents, often called "new kids on the block" or "babies," might struggle with basic microscope adjustments and cell identification initially [00:06:49]. Focus areas for first-year residents include:
*   **Normal Histology**: Studying normal histology of different organs is crucial before diving into pathology [00:08:10].
    *   **Book Recommendation**: Veters is personally preferred for its user-friendliness [00:08:27]. It is advised to compare different books to find what suits individual learning styles [00:08:51].
    *   **Visual Learning**: Utilize Google or YouTube for images and videos of structures like blood vessels to get eyes accustomed to them [00:09:29].
    *   **Microscope Usage**: Prioritize low power (4X or 10X) for diagnosis, as 80% of pathology diagnoses are made at these magnifications [00:09:42]. Use high power (40X) initially for details, but then view the same field at low power to develop a holistic approach [00:09:59].
*   **Hematology**:
    *   **Book Recommendations**: Wintrobe's is a good resource [00:10:25]. WHO is useful for leukemia and lymphomas [00:10:29]. Vnes is also suggested [00:10:34]. For absolute basics like identifying normal neutrophils or RBCs, Dr. T.J. Singh's book can be referred to [00:10:47]. Larger books can be used for more advanced topics like leukemias and anemias later [00:11:09].
*   **General Pathology**:
    *   **Book Recommendation**: Robins is the main textbook for theory and is highly recommended [00:13:47]. The speaker uses Robins as the starting point for all lectures [00:13:49].
*   **Systemic Pathology**:
    *   **Book Recommendations**: Aeran is preferred for general pathology, and Fletcher is recommended for tumors [00:12:55]. Sternberg is also an option, though not personally preferred by the speaker [00:13:06].
*   **FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology)**:
    *   **Book Recommendation**: Orel is the preferred book for FNAC, especially relevant for organs like thyroid, salivary gland, and breast where FNAC plays a crucial diagnostic role [00:16:58].
*   **Transfusion Medicine/Blood Banking**:
    *   **Book Recommendation**: Makroo is suggested for blood banking as it is concise and includes cases and questions after each chapter, covering everything from basic blood groups to APH [00:18:11].

## Pathology Residency App (PrepLadder)
An app for [[pathology_residency_challenges_and_worklife_balance | Pathology residency]] is being developed with PrepLadder [00:19:03].
*   **Content**: It will cover entire Robins (General Path, Systemic, Hematology) [00:15:12]. Systemic pathology will integrate information from Fletcher and Aeran, including buzzwords, keywords, viva questions, and [[differential_diagnosis_in_pathology | differential diagnosis]] [00:16:38]. Hematology will include basics from multiple books and Robins, integrated with WHO updates for classifications like AML and MDS [00:17:40]. Transfusion medicine will be covered, primarily based on Makroo [00:18:00].
*   **Practical Aspects**: The second half of the app will focus on practical topics like Clinical Pathology (urine, stool, semen analysis), basic biochemistry principles (KFT, LFT), histopathology processing, and a compilation of stains [00:20:41]. Weekly additions are planned based on feedback [00:21:32].
*   **Launch**: The tentative launch time is around May 2024 [00:16:04]. It will be available as a standalone pathology app [00:19:07].

## Community Engagement
A dedicated Telegram group has been created exclusively for [[pathology_residency_challenges_and_worklife_balance | Pathology residency]] members [00:06:08]. The link is in the video description [00:06:21]. This group will be used for:
*   Slide and morphology discussions [00:06:37].
*   Posting interesting daily cases with quick questions and audio descriptions [00:19:55].
*   Allowing residents to ask questions and share insights [00:49:57].

## Realities of Pathology as a Career
There are certain realities to consider when choosing pathology:
*   **Patient Interaction**: Pathologists typically have no direct patient interaction [00:22:16]. While they are a "strong backbone" in patient treatment through their reports, they don't receive the same direct credit as clinicians [00:22:29].
*   **Societal Perception**: Non-medical individuals or even some family members might not understand the importance of paraclinical branches like pathology, correlating a doctor's identity with wearing a stethoscope [00:23:08].
*   **[[career_prospects_and_choices_in_pathology | Career Prospects]]**:
    *   **Government Jobs**: These involve delays due to forms, seat availability, and require teaching experience (e.g., senior residency of 3+ years) [00:23:54]. These delays are common across all medical branches [00:24:30].
    *   **Private Practice**: Offers a huge spectrum depending on the state and whether one opens their own lab or works in an existing private lab [00:24:44]. Opening a lab in a saturated metropolitan area can be difficult due to existing chains and funding requirements, but it's more economical in peripheral areas [00:25:01].
    *   **Salary**: There's a wide range, from 1 lakh to 3-4 lakhs per month, depending on expertise (e.g., additional fellowship in a specialization like renal path), years of experience, and the practicing state [00:26:15]. Peripheries might pay more due to higher demand for pathologists [00:26:49].
    *   **Saturation**: While basic saturation exists in every medical branch, the portrayal of no jobs in pathology is inaccurate; ample jobs are available after MD completion [00:27:17].
*   **Choosing a College**: Personal preferences regarding location are key [00:29:13]. Institutions like Tata Mumbai and AIIMS Delhi are premium and provide excellent exposure but come with hectic work hours [00:29:03].
*   **[[pathology_residency_challenges_and_worklife_balance | Work-Life Balance]] during Residency**: Pathology residency is often very hectic, not a "9 to 4" job as some might believe [00:29:43]. It can involve working until 7-8 PM, or even 9-10 PM daily [00:29:57]. Some departments have academic activities (seminars, journal clubs) that extend hours [00:33:13]. Despite long hours, pathologists typically don't have 24-hour shifts or many night duties, except for emergency lab work [00:30:18]. A more hectic residency generally leads to becoming a better pathologist [00:30:35]. The ideal [[pathology_residency_challenges_and_worklife_balance | work-life balance]] (e.g., 9-5) usually comes *after* residency, when one can choose job profiles in government or private labs with fixed shifts [00:36:35].
*   **Academics in Departments**: If a department lacks strong academic activities, residents must take responsibility for their own learning by reading Robins and recent articles (e.g., one per week) to stay updated on immunohistochemical markers and genetic analysis [00:46:01].

## Post-Residency and Continuous Learning
After MD, individuals enter a "wish zone" where they can choose to take a break, work, or pursue further studies [00:40:54]. Continuous learning is encouraged through certificate courses and online programs [00:42:57]. For example, the speaker pursued a one-year course in hepatopathology to strengthen an area where their residency provided less exposure [00:41:59]. These courses allow upscaling at one's own pace and convenience [00:42:52].

Pathologists, especially postgraduate residents, are considered highly knowledgeable due to their constant engagement with textbooks [00:49:08]. The field encourages a give-and-take of knowledge between experienced professionals and residents [00:49:38].

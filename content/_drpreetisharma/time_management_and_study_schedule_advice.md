This article provides [[time_management_and_exam_anxiety | time management]] and study schedule advice for FMG students preparing for the December 2024 FMG exam, specifically focusing on a [[60day study timetable breakdown | 60-day plan]]. This strategy is applicable for both first-time examinees and those who previously scored below 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## General Strategy and Targets

The plan emphasizes two core elements: Theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

*   **Daily MCQs**: Aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If currently practicing fewer, gradually increase by 15-20 MCQs daily to reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Study Hours**: Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This is crucial for completing the syllabus and enabling multiple [[techniques_and_advice_for_effective_study_and_revision | revisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Revision Focus**: Success in the exam largely depends on the number of [[techniques_and_advice_for_effective_study_and_revision | revisions]] and daily MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Study Source**: Adhere to a single source per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Students should choose faculty or notes they understand best, mixing and matching if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Video Lectures**:
    *   For stronger subjects (scoring above 80% in Q-bank), refer to rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   For weaker subjects or topics (scoring less than 80% in Q-bank), utilize main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   Specific subjects like Pathology and Microbiology should be studied using only rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For Pathology, allocate 4 days for 19 hours of content, and for Microbiology, 3 days for 16 hours of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Watch at 1.5x to 1.75x speed (or even 2x for Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## [[creating_and_following_a_study_timetable | 60-Day Study Timetable Breakdown]] (July 24th - September 21st)

The [[60day study timetable breakdown | 60-day timetable]] is structured into four integrated subject blocks to facilitate learning and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This covers 58 days of study, with 2 days reserved for Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Block 1 (Foundation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

*   Surgery: 6 days (integrated with Anatomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days (integrated with Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
*   Radiology: 2 days (follows Surgery and Orthopedics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

### Block 2 (Basic Sciences & Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

*   Pharmacology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
*   Medicine: 6 days (builds on basic sciences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 2 days (overlaps with Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   Physiology: 1 day (focus on extra topics via Rapid Revision/LRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   Dermatology: 1 day (correlates with Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

### Block 3 (Standalone & Tougher Subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   **GT 1**: September 8th (after approximately 15 subjects are finished) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Dedicate the entire day to taking and reviewing the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **GT 2**: September 21st (at the end of the 60-day plan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule: Time Boxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>

To achieve 10 hours of daily study, the day should be divided into structured study and break sessions.

*   **Morning Routine (1 hour)**: Start the day with an hour for personal routine, including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)**: 3 hours of focused study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This trains for the long sitting hours required in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM)**: 30-minute break. This is for relaxation (e.g., closing eyes, listening to music, talking to family) and *not* for social media or digital screens, to avoid eye strain after video lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. By lunchtime, 5.5 hours of study are completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM)**: 1.5-hour break, including lunch (30 minutes) and an hour for relaxation, a power nap, or personal leisure, including social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)**: 1-hour break, a mixture of relaxation (20 minutes) and social interaction/media (30-40 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM)**: 2 hours of study (time decreases as the day progresses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Nightly Quick Review (9:00 PM onwards)**: Create a custom module of 30 mixed questions from subjects already completed that day. This casual test (approx. 30 minutes) helps stay in touch with past subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Wind Down & Sleep (until 11:00 PM - 11:30 PM)**: Allocate time for personal activities, social media, or watching a web series. Aim for 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Mindset for [[managing_study_schedules_and_targets | Managing Study Schedules and Targets]]

*   **No Past Guilt, No Future Anxiety**: Focus entirely on the present 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Erase prior dates and anxieties about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Consistency and Vigilance**: Adhere to the schedule as consistently as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Embrace Humility**: Tough times are a test and will pass. Embrace the journey with humility, as it builds character and leads to greater heights in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Clinical skills and humility are what truly matter in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

After the 60-day plan, a detailed revision plan (45 days, 25 days, 15 days) will be provided, adjusting based on the official exam date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The "Weekly Wednesday Wisdom" series is a recurring educational initiative designed to provide students with a structured approach to studying key medical topics, particularly pathology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Schedule and Structure
The sessions are held every Wednesday at 11 AM on the same channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. A timetable for topics is provided in advance, initially covering up to March, with subsequent schedules for April and May to be released later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. The series aims to maintain continuity, progressing through topics in sequence rather than introducing new, unrelated subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Target Audience and Purpose
This series is primarily aimed at students preparing for exams such as NEET PG, FMGE, and INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The overarching goal is to help students complete their syllabus before the May INI CET Exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. All class lectures are available until the July NEET PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The sessions are designed to keep students on track with their studies by providing clear targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>.

## Study Approach and Preparation
Students are encouraged to follow a structured approach for each session:
*   **Pre-session reading:** Before attending a session, students should read the assigned chapter from their chosen main videos or rapid revision materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This preparation ensures better understanding and engagement during the live quiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Post-session review:** After the session, it's advised to quickly review the discussed topic, especially focusing on images, for about 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. Images are typically found at the end of rapid revision sections in study apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Homework:** Small homework assignments, such as learning [[List of PAS positive and diastase sensitive/resistant things|PAS positive]] substances, will be given to reinforce learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Time management:** Students are advised to allocate dedicated time (e.g., three to four hours every Monday) to prepare for the Wednesday class, rather than cramming the night before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>. This helps in better retention and assessment of recall after 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>.

## Resources
*   **PDFs:** Annotated PDFs of the sessions will be provided later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
*   **Polls/Quizzes:** Session questions will be converted into polls for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision Videos:** For students with immediate exams, focusing on Rapid Revision videos, attending live sessions, and attempting Q-banks is recommended instead of watching lengthy main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
*   **Telegram Channels:**
    *   A channel for notifications and relevant information: "Pathology by Dr. Pri" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.
    *   A group for discussion and finding study partners: "Pathology by Preeti" (followed by surname) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.

The series emphasizes a [[Daily study targets and kick start morning sessions|structured approach to daily study targets]] and discipline, ensuring students cover essential topics for their exams. The instructor mentions that topics covered are relevant to all exams, with specific emphasis on INI CET, NEET PG, and FMGE where applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The series is presented as a continuation of previous [[60day study timetable breakdown|timetable planning]] and [[Timetable for FMGE preparation|FMGE timetable planning]] for students.

Sheathed microfilaria are a type of parasitic worm larva that can be identified microscopically based on the presence or absence of a sheath and the arrangement of nuclei in their tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:04">[03:22:04]</a>.

## Differentiation of Sheathed Microfilaria

Three primary types of sheathed microfilaria are commonly encountered: *Loa loa*, *Brugia malayi*, and *Wuchereria bancrofti* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:59">[03:00:59]</a>. These can be differentiated by examining the tail end for the presence and arrangement of nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10">[03:35:10]</a>.

*   ***Wuchereria bancrofti***
    *   Characterized by having **no nuclei at the tail tip** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:17">[03:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>. The nuclei end before the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:17">[03:46:17]</a>.
*   ***Brugia malayi***
    *   Identified by the presence of **two nuclei at the tail tip** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   ***Loa loa***
    *   Distinguished by a **continuous line of nuclei** extending right till the end of the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:09">[04:09:09]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations and Related Diseases

These microfilaria cause various forms of filariasis, which can lead to significant clinical symptoms. [[discussion_of_medical_content_like_microscopy_and_classifications | Microscopic investigations]] are key to their [[identification_and_significance_of_various_parasitic_eggs | identification and significance of various parasitic eggs]].

### Wuchereria bancrofti
*   Causes lymphatic filariasis, leading to **elephantiasis**, a condition characterized by swollen limbs due to lymphatic obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:15">[04:36:15]</a>.
*   Severe lymphatic obstruction can cause lymphatic channels to burst, resulting in lymph entering the urine, known as **chyluria**. This makes the urine appear milky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:56">[04:56:56]</a>.

### Onchocerca volvulus
While *Onchocerca volvulus* is an unsheathed microfilaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>, it is often discussed in contrast to the sheathed types due to its significant clinical impact and parasitic nature, falling under [[various_parasitic_life_cycles_and_their_hosts | various parasitic life cycles]].
*   Causes **onchocerciasis**.
*   **Clinical Features**:
    *   **Leopard skin or dermatitis**: Characterized by very dark, discolored skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. It is frequently seen in the black population and is associated with black flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:15">[05:36:15]</a>.
    *   **River blindness (sclerosing keratitis)**: A severe form of blindness where the eye appears to be covered by a sheath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:17">[05:56:17]</a>.
*   **Vector**: Black flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **Treatment**: The drug of choice for river blindness is Ivermectin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

### Loa loa
*   Commonly known as the **African eye worm** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>, due to the worm being visibly present in the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.
*   Causes **Calabar swelling**: A localized, temporary swelling and redness in the hands or other areas, representing a hypersensitivity reaction to the *Loa loa* parasite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

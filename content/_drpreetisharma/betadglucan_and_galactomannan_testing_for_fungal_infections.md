During the COVID-19 pandemic, specific tests for [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | fungal infections]] gained prominence, such as [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | black fungus]] [01:07:14]. Two important diagnostic markers are Beta D-Glucan and Galactomannan [01:07:36].

## Beta D-Glucan Testing

Beta D-Glucan is a normal component of the cell wall of [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | fungus]] [01:07:43]. It is used as a diagnostic marker for a wide range of [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | fungal organisms]] [01:08:06].

### Organisms Tested

Beta D-Glucan testing can be positive for many [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | fungal organisms]], including:
*   [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | Candida]] [01:08:06]
*   [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | Aspergillus]] [01:08:06]
*   [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | Histoplasma]] [01:08:06]
*   [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | Fusarium]] [01:08:06]
*   Dermatophytes [01:08:11]
*   [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | Pneumocystis jirovecii]] [01:08:11]

### Negative Results

Beta D-Glucan testing will be negative for specific [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | fungal organisms]] [01:08:18], which can be remembered by the mnemonic "BMC" [01:08:20]:
*   [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | Blastomyces]] [01:08:29]
*   [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | Mucor]] [01:08:34]
*   [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | Cryptococcus]] [01:08:38]

## Galactomannan Testing

Galactomannan is a specific marker that is particularly found in [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | Aspergillus]] [01:07:50]. While it can be positive for other [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | fungal organisms]], it is primarily used for the diagnosis of [[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | aspergillosis]] [01:08:50].

This guide focuses on [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | FMGE exam preparation tips]] specifically for students with approximately 10 days remaining until the January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This period is crucial and often referred to as "make or break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The session emphasizes "do's and don'ts" to maximize preparation in these final days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Do's and Don'ts for the Last 10 Days

### Subject Management and Coverage
-   **Assess Completed vs. Leftover Subjects**: Make a list of what you have already covered and what remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
-   **No New Major Topics**: Do not start anything entirely new in subjects you have already studied (e.g., rare topics in pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
-   **Cover All 19 Subjects**: It is crucial to have at least some knowledge of all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Aim to answer at least 50% of questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
    -   **Approach for Leftover Subjects**: For untouched subjects like Orthopedics, Anesthesia, or Forensics, utilize short LRR (Last Revision) sessions (e.g., 3-hour long sessions) or crash courses available on platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    -   **Short Subjects**: Prioritize subjects like ENT, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, and Skin, which can be covered quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Focus on their LRR notes/videos and previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Allocate about 2.5 days for these eight subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
    -   **Volatile/Giant Subjects**: Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM are considered volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. For these, revert to LRR sessions and previous year topics, rather than main videos or rapid revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
        -   *Specific Advice for Pharmacology and Microbiology*: These subjects are notoriously difficult to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. The mindset should be to study them once to pass and then not revisit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. Even just LRR videos (around 4 hours) and 150-200 PYQs will help secure at least 7-8 out of 15 questions, which is better than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.
    -   **Clinical Subjects**: For subjects like Medicine, Surgery, OBGYN, Pathology, and Physiology, focus only on previous year topics and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Daily Timetable and Routine
-   **Normalize Sleep Cycle**: Ensure you are alert during daytime exam hours by adjusting your sleep schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Aim for a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Avoid sleepless nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
-   **Avoid Experimentation**: Do not take new medications or change your routine just before the exam, as side effects are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
-   **Scanning Machine Mode**: In the last nine days, become a "scanning machine," quickly reviewing all previously read material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
-   **Divide Your Day into Four Slots**:
    1.  **Study Pattern (Theory & MCQs)**: Allocate 60% of your study time to MCQs and 40% to theory (specifically LRR PDFs/notes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
    2.  **Images**: Dedicate one hour daily to quickly scan through images, especially before going to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
    3.  **Sanity Break**: Allocate 30 minutes for an outdoor activity, a light walk, or something away from books (e.g., social media if it helps you relax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. This helps prevent mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
    4.  **No Pomodoro Technique**: Discontinue the Pomodoro technique. Practice sitting for 3 to 3.5 hours straight without distractions to mimic exam conditions and build focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) and MCQs
-   **Purpose of GTs**: If you choose to give a GT, do so for time management and identifying silly mistakes, not for the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
-   **Avoid Panic from Low Scores**: A low GT score (below 150) can cause significant panic and anxiety, hindering further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. If you cannot handle the pressure positively, it might be better to avoid GTs in the last 9 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
-   **MCQ Analysis**:
    -   If an MCQ is correct, do not read the explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
    -   If an MCQ is wrong, superficially read the explanation to determine if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap. Briefly review the topic if it's a knowledge issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
-   **Bouncer Questions**: Expect 20-30 "bouncer" questions in any exam or GT that you may not have encountered before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Do not let these questions demotivate you, as they are not the sole determinant of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
-   **Daily MCQ Quantity**: Aim for at least 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Gradually increase the number if currently doing less (e.g., add 10-20 questions per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
-   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**:
    -   **FMGE PYQs**: Solve the last five years of FMGE PYQs without fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
    -   **NEET PG PYQs**: If time permits, review the last three years of NEET PG questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. NEET PG papers often align with previous year topics rather than exact questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
    -   **INI CET**: If all else is done and time is still available, go through the most recent INI CET paper's recall session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
    -   **Avoid Rote Memorization of PYQs**: Do not just memorize answers to PYQs, as questions are rarely copied directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Instead, focus on understanding the underlying "previous year topics" and solving related MCQs from a Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

### Anxiety and Motivation Management
-   **Positivity is Key**: Surround yourself with positive people (family, good friends, teachers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Avoid those who brag about their scores or spread illogical rumors about exam difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
-   **Block Negative Thoughts**: One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. Focus on what you can do in the next three hours, not on future possibilities like alarm failures or computer issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
-   **Forgetting is Normal**: It is impossible to memorize all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. If you forget something, quickly pick it up and revise, don't let it lead to depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
-   **Mindset for Competitive Exams**: Success in competitive exams is a mixture of knowledge and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Mental stability and avoiding negativity are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
-   **Survival Mode**: In the last 9 days, view studying as a "survival mode." Do not think about whether you enjoy studying a subject; just get it done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

### Last Day and Exam Day Strategies
-   **Last Day Revision**: Focus on highly volatile subjects and weaker areas that you tend to forget (e.g., biochemistry cycles, microbiology classifications, pharmacology drugs, PSM schemes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Use PYQs and LRR notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.
-   **Exam Day Psychology**: Expect one paper to be tough and the other easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. If Paper 1 is difficult, do not discuss it during the break; mentally disconnect and focus on Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. Your overall passing score of 150+ will be a combination of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.

## Additional Support
-   **Daily Targets (OTD)**: Daily study targets for Path and Micro, focusing on 2-3 important topics that can be reviewed in 30 minutes, will be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.
-   **Image Sessions**: Recorded "Top 50 Images" sessions for Path and Micro will be made available for rapid review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
-   **Post-Exam Promise**: If you clear the exam with 150+ marks, an interview session will be conducted for every student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.
-   **Queries**: For any unanswered questions, leave comments below the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.

This article provides strategies for [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | FMG students]] with approximately 10 days remaining until the [[fmge_december_2024_exam_preparation | January 20th exam]]. The focus is on crucial "dos and don'ts" for this "make or break" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## General Principles for the Last 10 Days

This period is critical and requires specific [[medical_exam_preparation_strategies | medical exam preparation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### "Make or Break" Period
All previous studies, Q-bank work, and past year questions culminate in the effectiveness of these final 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Prioritize Scanning, Not Deep Study
At this stage, the goal is to become a "scanning machine," reviewing everything previously read without introducing new major topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

## Subject Management

It is acknowledged that most students have not finished all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Addressing Unfinished Subjects
*   **Do not study anything "new" in subjects you have already covered extensively** (e.g., rare pathology topics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Do not leave any subject untouched.** Aim to know "little by little" about all 19 subjects, enough to answer at least 50% of questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

### Categorizing Subjects
A recommended [[60day_study_timetable_for_fmge | subject management]] approach for the last nine days:

1.  **Short Subjects:** Dedicate approximately 2.5 days to these eight subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>:
    *   Head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>
    *   Psychiatry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
    *   Radiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
    *   Orthopedics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
    *   Anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>
    *   Forensics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>
    *   Dermatology (Skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>
    *   ENT (now considered a short subject) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>

2.  **Volatile/Giant Subjects:** These subjects are difficult to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>:
    *   Anatomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>
    *   Biochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>
    *   [[microbiology_test_preparation_strategies | Microbiology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>
    *   Pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>
    *   PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>
    These are subjects no one remembers well, and a quick cramming approach is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

3.  **Clinical Subjects:** These include Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, Pathology, Physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Recommended Study Resources
*   **LRR (Last Minute Revision) Sessions:** Watch the 3-hour LRR YouTube sessions or crash courses for subjects you haven't studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Even for giant subjects, focus on LRR videos and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision (RR) Notes:** Use if you are a fast reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs) and Topics:** Crucial for all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Focus on understanding the topics from which PYQs are asked, rather than memorizing answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
    *   Complete FMG's last five years' PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
    *   If time permits, review three years of [[neet_pg_2025_preparation_strategies | NEET PG]] questions (e.g., 2023, 2022, 2021 recall sessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
    *   If still more time, review the IAI CET November exam paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
    *   If unable to solve papers independently, listen to video recall sessions at 1.5x or 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

## Effective Study Practices

### Normalizing Sleep Cycle
*   Adjust your sleep schedule to be alert during the daytime, specifically from 9 AM to 11 AM, to match exam timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Aim for a minimum of 6 hours of sleep to ensure brain function and concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   Avoid sleepless nights or taking new medications before the exam, as reactions are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) and MCQ Practice
Grand Tests are important for [[mcq_examination_tips | MCQ examination tips]] and strategy.

#### Purpose of GTs
*   It's generally recommended not to give a GT in the last 9 days if a low score would cause panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   If you choose to take a GT, **focus only on time management and catching silly mistakes, not the score** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Practice completing 300 questions within the given time, with 20 minutes left for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   GTs will contain 20-30 "bouncers" (new/difficult questions) to prevent overconfidence; don't let these discourage you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. Your success is determined by known topics and avoiding silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

#### Analyzing MCQs
*   If an MCQ is correct, **do not read the explanation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   If an MCQ is wrong, superficially read the explanation to determine if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. If a knowledge gap, quickly read 5-10 lines on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

#### Daily MCQ Quantity
*   Previous successful students (scoring 150-200) did at least 150+ MCQs daily in the last 7-10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   Aim to increase daily MCQ count by 10-15 questions if you are currently doing less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   Custom modules from platforms are good for targeted MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.

#### Previous Year Questions (PYQs) vs. New Questions
*   Only PYQs are insufficient; focus on MCQs related to previous year *topics* from Q-banks, as questions are no longer copied and pasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

### Daily Study Structure
Divide your day into four time slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

1.  **Study Pattern (Theory & MCQs):**
    *   Allocate 60% of your study time to MCQs and 40% to theory (e.g., LRR PDFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
    *   MCQ practice inherently covers theory through explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

2.  **Images:** Dedicate 1 hour daily to rapidly scan images related to subjects studied that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

3.  **Sanity Break:** Allocate 30 minutes daily for an activity away from books, such as a light walk or watching reels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This helps prevent mental exhaustion and keeps life feeling normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Avoid converting this into a 3-4 hour break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

#### Productive Study Hours
*   Aim for a minimum of 12-14 productive study hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   Productive hours mean full concentration without distractions like phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   If you can complete your daily targets in 8-9 hours, that's fine; don't feel pressured by others' study durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

### Avoiding Common Mistakes
*   Do not compare yourself to others who claim high revision counts or scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   Ignore rumors about exam difficulty or pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Do not leave any subject untouched, even if you feel you have not studied it enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.
*   Do not stop studying because you are feeling exhausted or forgetful; this is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

## Mental Preparation and Anxiety Management

### Cultivating Positivity
*   Surround yourself only with people who give positive vibes: parents, siblings, good friends, and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   Avoid those who boast about their preparation or spread negativity/illogical rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   One negative thought can lead to one incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

### Ignoring Rumors and Negative Influences
*   Disconnect from any negative thought processes and rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
*   A wasted day can impact multiple subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Managing Exam Day Mindset
*   Do not worry about logistical issues on exam day (e.g., alarm, reaching center, computer working) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. Block these thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   Remember that [[medical_exam_preparation_strategies | competitive exams]] are a mixture of knowledge and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.
*   One paper of the FMG exam will likely be easy, and one will be tough; do not let a tough Paper 1 demotivate you for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. Disconnect from Paper 1 during the break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

## Specific Subject Advice

*   **Pharmacology and [[microbiology_test_preparation_strategies | Microbiology]]:** These subjects are generally difficult to remember and cause anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. Approach them with the mindset that you only need to study them once to pass and then never again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Focus on LRR and PYQs for these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
*   **PSM, Anatomy, Biochemistry:** These are also volatile subjects that are hard to master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. Again, focus on LRR and PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
*   **Learning is not about enjoying the subject right now, it's about survival.** Study whatever needs to be studied to pass, even if it feels boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.

## Final [[revision_strategy_for_fmge | Revision Strategy]] and Exam Day

### Last Day Revision
*   Focus primarily on PYQs and LRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.
*   Prioritize volatile subjects and topics you tend to forget (e.g., biochemistry cycles, microbiology catalysts, nerve supplies, pharma drugs, biostatistics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.

### Sustained Focus
*   The Pomodoro technique (20 min study, 10 min break) is no longer applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.
*   Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch without distractions to simulate exam conditions, maintaining alertness and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.
*   Work in "boxes" of 3-hour study sessions, focusing on the immediate task rather than future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.

From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

This session focuses specifically on students appearing for the NEET PG exam on March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Students preparing for FMGE were advised that their session was held earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Key Questions Addressed
Two main questions were frequently asked by students: when will the "kick start morning session" begin, and when will the daily targets commence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Daily Targets
Daily targets for Pathology and Microbiology will begin shortly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. These targets will be provided in the form of a G-sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The topics should be covered from Rapid Revision (RR) videos or from any other source the student is already following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Students following [[Daily targets for NEET PG 2024 | daily targets]] for Pathology and Microbiology can save the dedicated 4-day slots in the timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:07">[02:06:07]</a>. Daily targets involve studying Pathology and Microbiology for 40-40 minutes each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:27">[02:06:27]</a>. For interns, these daily targets allow studying Pathology and Microbiology even during duties like inserting a cannula or making a death certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. Topics for daily targets will be updated three to four days in advance to allow for planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:57">[03:19:57]</a>.

## Kick Start Morning Sessions
The "Kick Start Morning" sessions are early morning sessions (historically 7:30 AM, but flexible) designed to encourage early rising and productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These sessions will focus on MCQ-based discussions, not just theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Kick Start Morning sessions will only begin after students have completed one full round of Pathology and Microbiology from their Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This ensures that students are not listening to the material for the first time, preventing wasted time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The approach will involve students reading five topics, then discussing them quickly in a morning session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. If extra material is needed beyond Rapid Revision for Path and Micro, it will be covered in the Kick Start Morning sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:32">[02:31:32]</a>.

## Video Sources: Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision
If a student has already covered 85-90% of the syllabus once, it is advised to opt for Rapid Revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, for certain "deadly," "bulky" subjects that yield many questions or "crooked questions," main videos should still be referred to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Subjects recommended for main videos:
*   Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   OBGY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
*   PSM (due to atypical questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
*   Anatomy (if weak, as RR might be "further torture") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>

For other subjects, Rapid Revision is generally sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>. However, Rapid Revision alone is never 100% sufficient; it must be complemented with a QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:57">[03:33:57]</a>. Relying solely on LRR or 4-5 hours of LRR videos is not recommended for core study, but it is excellent for revision in the last month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:02">[04:04:02]</a>.

## Previous Year Topics (PYTY / PYQs)
Focus on Previous Year Topics (PYTY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Students do not need to search for these, as they are widely available on platforms like Instagram and in PYTY books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

For NEET PG, focus on the last five years of PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:07">[03:46:07]</a>. For INI CET, the last three years of PYQs are relevant, as the exam pattern has overlapped more with NEET PG since it came under INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:55">[03:54:55]</a>.

For FMGE, watching PYQ discussion sessions (e.g., PrepLadder's 2-hour videos covering 5 years of FMGE PYQs) is more efficient than solving from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

[!CAUTION]
Only relying on PYQs will not guarantee a good rank in NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:21">[03:26:21]</a>. PYQ *topics* along with Rapid Revision are helpful, but not PYQs alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)
Allocate half a day for Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The effective time for giving the exam is 3-3.5 hours, and the rest of the half-day should be used for quick analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### GT Analysis Strategy
*   Do not read explanations for correct answers, as you are already revising notes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Focus on analyzing incorrect answers: determine if it was a silly mistake, an unknown topic, a new concept, or insufficient time/effort in analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   Avoid being overly "statistic-driven" (e.g., focusing only on how many incorrect or time taken) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   The true purpose of a GT is to analyze why something was wrong and where it came from (fact-based, rote, concepts, clinical questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This analysis helps tailor future preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Frequency of GTs
*   Fortnightly (every two weeks) is recommended if GTs are approached positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   If GT results cause significant demotivation or depression, reduce frequency to once every three weeks until a positive mindset is developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   Approach GTs as opportunities to pick out mistakes, practice time management, and assess completion of the exam within the given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   GTs are designed to be slightly tougher than the main exam to provide an extra push for study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

## Last Round Revision (LRR)
The LRR for NEET PG will be conducted in January and February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. NEET PG students are encouraged to attend FMGE LRR sessions (held in November/December) for main subjects, as they will cover FMGE PYQs and provide passive revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>.

## Study Plan & Timetable
A comprehensive study timetable has been created, covering three rounds of revision until the last day before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>. This timetable is designed to be "comfortable" and accounts for various factors like backlogs, anxiety, and unforeseen emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:57">[01:51:57]</a>.

Today (before the timetable starts tomorrow) is the last day to settle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a>. If nothing else is to be studied, take a baseline Grand Test today with the promise not to judge results, analyze incorrect answers, and then sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>.

### Round 1 (Until January 10th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>
This round is slightly liberal with days to allow for completion and question practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
*   **Medicine:** Integrate 1.5-2 hours of Medicine study daily alongside other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. This helps finish Medicine without tension and allows daily integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.
*   **Anatomy:** 5 days (can be reduced to 3 if using RR, but 5 days if main videos are used) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:29">[01:42:29]</a>.
*   **Orthopedics:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:34">[01:58:34]</a>.
*   **Biochemistry:** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:26">[02:26:26]</a>.
*   **ENT:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:43">[02:28:43]</a>.
*   **Psychiatry:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>.

*   **Anesthesia:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:04">[03:47:04]</a>.
*   **PSM:** 5 days (it's always less no matter how much you read) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:04">[03:57:04]</a>.
*   **Surgery:** 6 days (can be 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:06">[04:01:06]</a>.
*   **Radiology:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:54">[04:07:54]</a>.
*   **OBGY:** 6 days (due to bulk of questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:07">[04:12:07]</a>.
*   **Ophthalmology (Ophth):** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:49">[04:18:49]</a>.
*   **Forensic Medicine & Toxicology (FMT):** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:10">[04:20:10]</a>.
*   **Pediatrics (Pedia):** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:01">[04:25:01]</a>.
*   **Pharmacology (Pharmak):** 4 days (can be 2, but extra day for GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:07">[04:27:07]</a>.
*   **Pending Days:** These are buffer days for backlogs or Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. Medicine can be covered on these days if other subjects are finished early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

### Round 2 (Starts January 11th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>
This round is for revision, with shorter durations for subjects.
*   **Medicine:** Revise the entire subject in 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:44">[02:09:44]</a>.
*   **ENT/Ophth:** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:16">[02:14:16]</a>.
*   **Short Subjects (multiple):** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:50">[02:21:50]</a>.
*   **Physiology:** 1 day (not 2 as previously) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>.
*   **Pharmacology:** 3 days (due to its volatile nature, needs extra revision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:03">[02:49:03]</a>.
*   **Pediatrics:** 2 days (more than enough if Medicine is covered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:32">[02:58:32]</a>.
*   **Surgery:** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:47">[03:16:47]</a>.
*   **OBGY:** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:59">[03:18:59]</a>.

### Round 3 (Starts February 8th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:20">[03:33:20]</a>
This is the final phase, with highly condensed days.
*   Most subjects are reduced to 1-2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:04">[03:37:04]</a>.
*   Short subjects (ENT, Ophth, Physio) to be finished in less than a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:57">[03:53:57]</a>.
*   Focus heavily on previous year topics, LRR videos, and volatile subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   Medicine: Revise in 3 days (last revision for the exam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:04">[04:14:04]</a>.
*   Pharmacology: Revise in 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:35">[04:19:35]</a>.
*   PSM: Revise in 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>.
*   Volatile subjects (Anatomy, Biochemistry) should be prioritized in the last week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Microbiology will be covered through LRR and daily targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

### Internship Schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:12">[02:09:12]</a>
Interns should follow the same subject sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:01">[02:14:01]</a>.
*   Add one extra day to each subject's allocation to account for less study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:24">[02:41:24]</a>.
*   Source: Rapid Revision + Q Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>.
*   Finish short subjects (Psychiatry, Radiology, Ortho, Anesthesia, Forensic, Skin) quickly, especially during light posting periods, for a confidence boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>.

## Customization and Mindset
The timetable is a tentative outline; individual customization is necessary based on syllabus coverage and study patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.

[!TIP]
*   Don't over-rely on statistics or numerical scores for self-worth; focus on the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Confront "nightmare" subjects (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology) by studying them thoroughly from main videos or notes, spending adequate time (4-5 days), and practicing questions to overcome fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:01">[04:01:01]</a>.
*   Avoid the "self-blame cycle" for past exam results or current struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>. View a bad exam as a single bad day, not a predictor of future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>.
*   Be practical: acknowledge that sick days, emergencies, anxiety, and comparisons with peers will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. The timetable has buffer days built in to accommodate these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>.
*   The goal is to say, "I had read my best, I had done my best" regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:37">[01:59:37]</a>.

## QBank Strategy
*   Along with notes, aim to solve 100-150 MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>. This target should be built up slowly (e.g., increasing by 5-10 questions daily from 70-80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.
*   Questions should be from the subject being studied on that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>.
*   Solving PYQs, one-liners, or topic-wise questions may lead to covering more than 150 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>.
*   There are no separate days allocated for QBank; it must be integrated with subject study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:02">[03:54:02]</a>.
*   For bulky subjects (Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, PSM, Anatomy, Pharmacology), aim to cover the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:50">[03:36:50]</a>.
*   For short subjects, the RR QBank is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:02">[03:54:02]</a>. NEET PG Essence is a recommended QBank book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:44">[03:28:44]</a>.

## Breaks
*   Avoid the Pomodoro Technique (20-30 min study, 10 min break) when only 2-3 months are left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:02">[05:54:02]</a>.
*   Train the mind for longer stretches of vigilance, similar to exam conditions (2.5-3 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   A 15-minute break after a long stretch is generally good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:30">[06:42:30]</a>. What is done during the break is personal, but avoiding social media is often advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:03">[06:49:03]</a>.

## Integrated vs. Subject-Wise Study
The provided timetable follows a subject-wise approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:01">[07:05:01]</a>. Integrated system-wise timetables often lead to neglecting important general subjects (e.g., General Pathology, General Microbiology, Forensic, Biochemistry) not tied to specific body systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Daily medicine study and Grand Tests help with integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

## Other Study Resources
*   **Crash Courses/BTR (Beat the Rush):** These should be run side-by-side with the main study plan, not as a sole source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:02">[07:54:02]</a>. They help compile and condense information, but don't replace in-depth study if time allows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
*   **Review Books/Standard Textbooks:** No time for these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. Stick to main videos for weak topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   **Electron Microscopic Images:** Important for INI CET (often rare images), less so for NEET PG (usually standard images) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Rapid Revision images should be sufficient for NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **Note-taking:** Focus on main buzzwords and understanding rather than writing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

## Final Advice
*   Do not mix INI CET and NEET PG preparation completely; they have similarities but are distinct exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   The primary lesson from INI CET (if applicable) is to be practical and avoid relying solely on 4-6 hour LRR videos as the only source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   Believe in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Doubting oneself ("is it possible?") already loses half the battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   Focus on what can be done from today forward with full honesty and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   History should not repeat itself; do not waste time on past disappointments when the future holds potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

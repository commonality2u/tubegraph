This guide outlines a comprehensive [[planning_strategy_for_neetpg_2025 | planning strategy]] for students preparing for the NEET PG exam, specifically those appearing on March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Daily Targets and Subject Approach
The preparation involves structured [[daily_targets_and_timetable_planning_for_neet_pg | daily targets]] and a strategic approach to subject content.

### Daily Targets for Pathology and Microbiology
*   [[daily_targets_and_timetable_planning_for_neet_pg | Daily targets]] will commence tomorrow, providing a structured way to cover Pathology and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Topics will be listed on a Google Sheet, primarily derived from Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   If you are not using Rapid Revision, you should refer to your current study source for the given topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Students have the option to dedicate four days to Path and Micro or follow [[daily_targets_and_timetable_planning_for_neet_pg | daily targets]] of 40 minutes each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. This flexibility allows for individual customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

### Kickstart Morning Sessions
*   These early morning sessions (e.g., 7:30 AM) are designed to encourage waking up early and maximizing the study day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   Kickstart Morning sessions will begin *after* students complete their first round of Rapid Revision videos for Pathology and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   The sessions will focus on MCQ-based discussions rather than just theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   The platform for these sessions will be YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
*   Topics for 3-4 days will be updated in advance to help students, especially interns, plan their study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

## Study Resources: Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision
The choice between main videos and rapid revision (RR) depends on your current knowledge base:
*   If you have covered 85-90% of the material once, opt for Rapid Revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Main Videos are recommended for**:
    *   Final year subjects: Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, and PSM, as these subjects yield many complex questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   Anatomy: If you are weak in this area, Rapid Revision might not be sufficient and could cause more difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
    *   Pharmacology: If you lack confidence with Rapid Revision, main videos are advised to overcome this "scare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.
    *   Any "scary" subject from your personal list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision (RR) is suitable for**:
    *   Subjects you are strong in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.
    *   Pathology and Microbiology, especially when complemented with a QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.
*   Do not switch your study source if you have already completed a subject from one source (e.g., KSM notes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.

## Previous Year Topics (PYTs) and Grand Tests

### Previous Year Topics (PYTs)
*   Focus on PYTs, as they are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   You don't need to search for them; many resources (e.g., Instagram, PrepLadder) provide them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.
*   PYQs alone are not sufficient for a good rank; they must be combined with Rapid Revision and QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.
*   For NEET PG, consider solving PYQs from the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.
*   For INI CET, focus on the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.
*   For FMGE, use video discussions of five-year PYQs to cover them efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   Allocate half a day for a grand test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   Spend approximately 3.5 hours on the exam itself, and use the rest of the half-day for quick analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Analysis Strategy**:
    *   Do not read explanations for correct answers; review them in your daily notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   Focus on explanations for incorrect answers to understand *why* you got them wrong (silly mistake, new topic, lack of time, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
    *   Avoid being solely driven by statistics (number of incorrect answers, time spent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   The primary goal of GTs is to identify mistakes and manage time, not to predict your final rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Frequency**:
    *   Fortnightly (every two weeks) is recommended for students who can maintain a positive mindset towards GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   If GT scores cause significant demotivation, consider taking them once every three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   Take a baseline grand test without self-judgment today, analyze incorrect answers, and then start the new timetable tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## LRR (Last Revision Round) Sessions
*   LRR sessions for NEET PG will be conducted in January and February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   NEET PG students should also attend the FMGE PYQ sessions, as they cover relevant content and help complete FMGE PYQs without extra effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.

## Timetable Structure (Three Rounds)
A detailed timetable is provided, spanning three revision rounds until the exam.

### Round 1 (Till January 10th)

*   Surgery and OBGY: 3 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:32">[03:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:07">[03:19:07]</a>.

### Round 3 (Starting February 8th)
*   This is the final phase, less than a month before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:30">[02:33:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   Focus on previous year topics, LRR videos, and volatile subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:49">[03:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:52">[03:03:52]</a>.
*   Short subjects (ENT, Ophth, Physio, etc.): Less than a week for all six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:38">[02:47:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:22">[02:53:22]</a>.
*   Medicine: 3 days for final revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:35">[03:12:35]</a>.
*   Pharmacology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:28">[03:18:28]</a>.
*   PSM: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:05">[03:21:05]</a>.
*   Other subjects: 1-2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:29">[03:25:29]</a>.
*   Volatile subjects (Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology) should be covered in the last week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:18">[03:28:18]</a>. Microbiology will be covered in LRR and [[daily_targets_and_timetable_planning_for_neet_pg | daily targets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

## Interns' Strategy
*   Follow the same subject sequence as the general timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>.
*   Rely only on Rapid Revision videos and a QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>. Avoid main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:20">[02:28:20]</a>.
*   Add an extra day to each subject's allocation to account for less study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:27">[02:40:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:59">[02:44:59]</a>.
*   Finish short subjects quickly (e.g., Psychiatry, Radiology, Ortho, Anesthesia, Forensic, Skin) in 7-8 days during a light posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:08">[02:59:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:59">[03:09:59]</a>.
*   For Pathology and Microbiology, follow the [[daily_targets_and_timetable_planning_for_neet_pg | daily targets]] (40 minutes daily), as this helps cover them while working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:42">[03:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## Question Bank (QBank) and MCQs
*   Solve 100-150 MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>.
*   Practice questions from the subject you are currently studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a>.
*   There are no separate days for QBank; it must be integrated into the daily subject study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:19">[03:54:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:53">[03:55:53]</a>.
*   For bulky subjects (Medicine, Surgery, Gynecology, PSM, Anatomy, Pharmacology), use a comprehensive QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:58">[03:36:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:27">[03:39:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:50">[03:45:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:12">[03:46:12]</a>.
*   For short subjects (Path, Micro), use the Rapid Revision QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:50">[03:53:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:09">[03:54:09]</a>.

## Maintaining Motivation and Mindset
*   It's normal to feel demotivated or experience dips in motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>.
*   Focus on what you *can* do going forward, rather than past results or ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:50">[04:59:50]</a>.
*   Overcome "nightmare" subjects (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology) by confronting them through main videos and extensive QBank practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:59">[04:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:30">[04:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:23">[04:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:43">[04:24:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
*   Confidence comes from solving questions; increase your daily question count to boost it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   If you are consistently studying 10-11 hours per day with good output, you are on the right track; do not push for more hours to avoid mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:25">[04:44:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:48">[04:48:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:16">[04:52:16]</a>.
*   It's crucial to take action rather than just knowing what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

## Specific Advice
*   **Study Breaks**: For effective study, aim for two long stretches of 2.5-3 hours each, training your mind to stay vigilant for extended periods, similar to exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. After these stretches, take a 15-minute break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Timetables**: Avoid purely integrated timetables (e.g., system-wise) that might neglect foundational subjects or non-systemic topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. The suggested timetable ensures broader coverage with daily medicine integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Crash Courses/BTR**: These can be supplemental for compilation and revision, but should not replace in-depth study if time permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. Integrate them into your routine alongside notes, MCQs, and GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Review Books**: Avoid using external review books at this stage; stick to your main video notes or Rapid Revision notes for weak topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Writing Notes**: Focus on main buzzwords and understanding rather than writing down everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

The [[role_of_culture_media_in_microbiology | use of culture media]] is a fundamental [[microbiological_techniques_and_tests | microbiological technique]] for the [[diagnosis_and_identification_of_bacterial_infections | diagnosis and identification of bacterial infections]] [00:00:29]. This article outlines various [[overview_of_bacterial_culture_media | culture media]] and the [[characteristics_of_specific_bacterial_cultures | specific characteristics]] exhibited by different bacteria, crucial for their identification [00:00:35].

## Gram-Positive Bacteria

### Staphylococcus aureus
*   **Fermentation:** Shows Mannitol fermentation [00:02:06].
*   **Salt Tolerance:** Grows well in the presence of salt [00:02:24].
*   **Culture Media:** Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA) [00:02:37]. Other salt agars like Loot Lamps Salt Agar are also applicable [00:02:42].
*   **Appearance:** Mannitol fermentation on MSA gives a yellow color [00:03:05].
*   **Indicator:** Phenol red [00:03:30].
*   **General Rule for Fermentation:** Most fermentations (Mannitol, Lactose, Sucrose) result in a yellow color change, with specific indicators varying [00:04:02].

### Streptococcus pyogenes
*   **Growth on Blood Agar:** Shows a wide zone of hemolysis [00:05:05] and pin-point colonies [00:05:14]. This is often remembered by the mnemonic "Pi Pi Y" (Pin-point colonies, wide zone of hemolysis) [00:05:37].
*   **Transport Media:** Pike's media [00:05:57]. The name "Pike's" aligns with the "Pi Pi Y" mnemonic for *Pyogenes* [00:06:06].
*   **Selective Media:** PNF media [00:06:36], Crystal Violet Blood Agar [00:06:49].
*   **Liquid Media Appearance:** Tends to show granularity in liquid media [00:07:05].

### Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus)
*   **Camp Test:** *S. agalactiae* is Camp test positive [00:07:43].
    *   **Principle:** The Camp test shows enhanced hemolysis at the junction of *S. agalactiae* (horizontal line) and *Staphylococcus aureus* (vertical line) streaks on blood agar [00:10:28].
    *   **Other Camp Test Positive Organism:** *Listeria* [00:08:29]. *Listeria* is characterized by tumbling motility [00:09:05].

### Enterococcus
*   **Morphology:** Spectacle-shaped organism [00:12:18].
*   **Culture Media:** Bile Esculin Azide Agar [00:12:29].
*   **Appearance:** Produces a black color on Bile Esculin Azide Agar due to bile esculin hydrolysis [00:12:47]. This is linked to the "BBB" mnemonic (B for bile esculin, B for black, B for bilobility/spectacle shape) [00:12:52].

## Gram-Negative Bacteria

### Neisseria (meningitidis and gonorrhoeae)

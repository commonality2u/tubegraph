Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a syndrome characterized by the development of various tumors and other findings across multiple organ systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Genetic Basis
Tuberous Sclerosis is associated with mutations in two main genes:
*   **TSC1 gene** (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, located on chromosome 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, encodes the protein Hamartin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **TSC2 gene** (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, located on chromosome 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, encodes the protein Tuberin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations
TS can affect various organs, leading to a range of symptoms and findings, often involving hamartomatous tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>:

### Neurological Findings
*   **Intellectual disability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
*   **Seizures** and **Epilepsy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, often due to cortical tubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **CNS Tumors:** Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Cardiac Involvement
*   **Rhabdomyoma:** This is the most likely cardiac tumor in a patient suffering from intellectual disability and seizures, strongly correlating with Tuberous Sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Rhabdomyoma is a hamartomatous tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, which is why a skeletal muscle tumor (rhabdomyoma) can occur in the heart (cardiac muscle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   **Microscopic appearance:** Rhabdomyomas are characterized by "spider cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. These cells have a central nucleus with radiating cytoplasmic strands, resembling a spider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. The white area in spider cells is due to glycogen, which is positive for PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) staining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
    *   **Prevalence:** Rhabdomyoma is the most common primary benign cardiac tumor in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Other Organ Involvement
*   **Dermatological Findings:**
    *   **Ash leaf spot:** Hypopigmented lesions on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   **Shagreen patch:** Thickened, leathery skin appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   **Angiofibroma** on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Pulmonary Findings:** Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, a tumor involving lymphatic channels, blood vessels, and smooth muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. LAM is a hamartomatous tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Renal Findings:** [[renal_pathology_and_cancers | Angiomyolipoma (AML)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, which is also a hamartomatous tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Normally, muscle and fat are not expected in the kidneys, but they appear in this hamartomatous condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Other Cardiac Tumors
While Rhabdomyoma is key in TS, other cardiac tumors include:
*   **Secondary/Metastatic Tumors:** These are the most common malignant cardiac tumors overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Primary Cardiac Tumors:**
    *   **Adults:**
        *   Benign: Myxoma (most common) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, typically found in the left atrium as a jelly-like mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Microscopically, it features lepidic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
        *   Malignant: Angiosarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   **Children:**
        *   Benign: Rhabdomyoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
        *   Malignant: Rhabdomyosarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Cardiac Valvular Tumor:** Papillary Fibroelastoma (PFE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, which appears like a sea anemone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

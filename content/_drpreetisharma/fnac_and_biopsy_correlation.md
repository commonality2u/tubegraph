Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) and biopsy are both diagnostic procedures used in pathology. While FNAC is a less invasive initial assessment, biopsy provides more detailed histological information. The findings from both techniques often correlate, providing a comprehensive diagnostic picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Diagnostic Process
In cases such as a neck swelling, an FNAC may be performed first, followed by a biopsy for further confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Correlative Findings

### Granulomatous Lymphadenitis
In a case of neck swelling leading to a diagnosis of granulomatous lymphadenitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>:

*   **FNAC Findings:** The FNAC image prominently displayed a multi-nucleated giant cell, which is very characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Additionally, many cells with elongated, slipper-shaped nuclei were observed, identified as epithelial cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The presence of multi-nucleated giant cells and slipper-shaped epithelial cells suggested the presence of a granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Biopsy Findings:** The biopsy picture on higher power confirmed what was seen on FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. It also showed giant cells and elongated, slipper-shaped epithelial cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Furthermore, the biopsy revealed a lymphocytic collar, characterized by many tiny blue dot-like cells at the periphery, surrounding the granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Components of a Granuloma:** A granuloma typically consists of giant cells, epithelioid cells, and a lymphocytic collar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Epithelioid cells, even without giant cells, surrounded by a lymphocytic collar can also indicate a granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Caseous Necrosis
If a lymph node gross image showed caseous necrosis (a cheesy appearance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, an FNAC from this material would appear pink and granular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Necrosis is characterized by dirty, granular material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Intestinal Biopsy
An [[mcq_on_intestinal_biopsy_findings | intestinal biopsy]] was presented for a 14-year-old patient showing specific histopathological findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The biopsy revealed an arborizing polyp pattern, where muscle tissue extends between round epithelial glands, resembling the branches of a tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This specific pattern, sometimes called a "Christmas tree polyp," is characteristic of a hamartomatous polyp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

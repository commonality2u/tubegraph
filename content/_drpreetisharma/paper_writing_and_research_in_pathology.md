Engaging in paper writing and research is a valuable aspect of [[pathology_residency_overview | pathology residency]]. It's an opportunity to contribute to the medical field and develop crucial academic skills. The process is cumulative, requiring sustained effort over time rather than quick bursts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Types of Publications

As a resident, focusing on different types of publications can help build experience and expertise:

### Original Articles
Original articles typically involve more extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The speaker aimed to write two to three original articles during their residency and senior residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This effort spans several years, often throughout postgraduate (PG) and senior residency (s-ship) periods, totaling around six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. It's common not to write many articles during PG due to time constraints, with more opportunities arising during senior residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Case Reports
Case reports are generally faster to write than original articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. They don't necessarily need to be "one in a million" cases; a series of four to five cases can also be compiled to offer a new perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The speaker offers to guide residents through the process of writing these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Reviews
Reviews are typically undertaken during senior residency as they are comprehensive, akin to writing a mini-book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The speaker mentions a personal favorite review on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis due to an interest in genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Academic Engagement and Journals

Beyond writing, active engagement with academic resources is crucial for [[resources_and_study_strategies_for_pathology_residents | pathology residents]].

### Importance of Journals
Reading recent articles is a very important part of academics, particularly for Journal Clubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. A recommended aim is to read one article per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. This helps in staying updated on new immunohistochemical markers, genetic analyses, and emerging genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

The speaker will provide a list of recommended websites and journals for pathologists via Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

### Academic Activities in Departments
Some departments have very well-established academic activities, including daily seminars and slide seminars, while others do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

> [!INFO] Self-Responsibility for Academics
> If a department lacks strong academic activities, it becomes the resident's responsibility to manage their own learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. This includes consistently reading Robins and recent journal articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. Even in departments with academic activities, first-year residents might be too exhausted from grossing to fully absorb lectures, often studying on their own afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

### Lifelong Learning
Learning doesn't stop after residency. One can pursue additional certificate courses or fellowships in specialized areas to upscale skills and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. For example, if a resident identifies a weaker area, like liver pathology due to limited exposure in their department, they can later pursue a course in that specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. The availability of online courses and webinars makes such continued learning more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. This self-paced learning is a personal choice after completing the MD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.

## Overview
[[Gram positive bacilli | Gram positive bacilli]], particularly *[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae | Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]*, are bacilli that represent an exception to the general rule that bacilli are typically Gram-negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The mnemonic "McDonald's" is used to remember [[Gram positive bacilli | Gram-positive bacilli]], where 'D' stands for Diphtheriae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations
*   **Sore Throat and Membrane**: A child presenting with sore throat, low-grade fever, and a thick membrane covering the tonsils and pharynx is highly indicative of *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This characteristic thick membrane is known as a pseudomembrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Bull's Neck**: Another classical sign is a "bull's neck," caused by extensive lymphadenopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Complications**: The most common complication of diphtheria is myocarditis, which can present with fat deposition in the heart, leading to a "tiger and tabby cat appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

## Diagnostic Features

### Microscopy and Staining
*   **Gram Stain**: *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* appears as purple-colored, long, [[Gram positive bacilli | gram-positive bacilli]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **Arrangement**: They exhibit a characteristic "Chinese letter" or "cuneiform" arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
*   **Granules**: The bacteria possess large, bulbous ends containing "Volutin granules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. These are also known as Babes-Ernst granules, bipolar granules, or metachromatic granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
    *   **Albert Stain**: Volutin granules are visualized using Albert stain, which involves a sequence of toluidine blue, iodine, and malachite green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. On Albert stain, the bacterial body appears green, while the granules stain purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Metachromasia**: The purple color of the granules from a blue stain (toluidine blue) is an example of metachromasia, where a stain gives a different color under the microscope than its inherent color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. Toluidine blue is famously a metachromatic stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a> and is also a special stain for mast cells and basophils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
    *   **Composition**: These granules contain polymetaphosphate, serving as an energy reserve for the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

### Sample Collection
For throat diphtheria, the sample for culture should be taken from *underneath* the pseudomembrane, as the membrane itself consists of dead cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Culture Media
*   **Enriched Media**: Loeffler's serum slope is an enriched culture medium that allows for rapid growth (6-8 hours), making it useful for early diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Selective Media**:
    *   **Potassium Tellurite Agar**: This selective medium turns black due to the reduction of tellurite by the bacteria, producing black colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. However, it takes longer to grow (48 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. It is considered the best culture medium for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.
    *   **Tinsdale Agar**: Another selective medium for *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

### Toxin Detection and Susceptibility Tests
*   **Elek Gel Precipitation Test**: This test determines the toxigenicity of the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
    *   It involves placing a strip impregnated with antitoxin on a culture medium where bacterial colonies are grown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
    *   The formation of precipitant lines indicates the presence of toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. If lines are present, the bacteria are toxigenic; if not, they are non-toxigenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Schick Test**: An intradermal test used to determine a patient's susceptibility to diphtheria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
    *   It is a Type III hypersensitivity reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
    *   A positive test (redness) means the patient is susceptible to the infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
    *   A negative test means the patient is immune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.

### Virulence Factors
*   **Diphtheria Toxin**: This is a potent toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> that acts by decreasing protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Its mechanism of action involves ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. This is known as an ADP phosphoribosyltransferase activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Treatment
*   **Droplet Precautions**: Essential for all cases due to droplet spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>.
*   **Antibiotics**: Penicillin and Erythromycin are relevant antibiotics and should be administered in all cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.
*   **Diphtheria Antitoxin (DAT)**:
    *   Typically given intramuscularly (IM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.
    *   Dosage varies: 20,000-40,000 units for pharyngeal disease, 40,000-60,000 units for nasopharyngeal disease, and 80,000-120,000 units (crossing 1 lakh) for extensive disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. An average range of 20,000 to 120,000 international units is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.
    *   For neck disease or disease lasting more than three days, half the dose is given IM and half intravenously (IV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. This split administration is crucial for severe infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

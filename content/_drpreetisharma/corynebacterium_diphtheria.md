## Overview
Corynebacterium diphtheria is a gram-positive bacillus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>. It is part of the [[gram_positive_bacilli_overview | Gram Positive Bacilli Overview]] group, often remembered by the mnemonic "McDonald's" (Mycobacteria, Clostridium, Diphtheria, Nocardia, Actinomyces, Listeria, Bacillus, and Lactobacillus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations
Corynebacterium diphtheria is known for causing diphtheria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:46">[10:04:46]</a>.
Classical symptoms include:
*   Sore throat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:33">[08:47:33]</a>
*   Low-grade fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:33">[08:50:33]</a>
*   Thick throat membrane covering the tonsils and pharynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:33">[08:50:33]</a>
*   Pseudo membrane formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>
*   Bull's neck due to lymphadenopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:09">[11:21:09]</a>, which is a common clinical feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:59">[11:47:59]</a>.

When collecting a sample from the pseudo membrane, it's important to remove the membrane and take the sample from underneath, as the membrane contains dead cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:11">[10:53:11]</a>.

The most common complication of diphtheria is myocarditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:11">[34:44:11]</a>. Diphtheria myocarditis can show fat deposition in the heart, leading to a "tiger and tabby cat appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:26:07">[34:26:07]</a>.

## Characteristics of Corynebacterium Diphtheria
Diphtheria spreads via droplet infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:11:46">[39:11:46]</a>.
On Gram stain, it appears as long, purple-colored rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:19">[25:56:19]</a>.
A classic appearance is the "Chinese letter" or "cuneiform arrangement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:18">[26:21:18]</a>.
[[corynebacterium_diphtheria_characteristics | Corynebacterium diphtheria]] also has bulbous ends containing large granules known as Valtan granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:09">[26:44:09]</a>. These are also called Babes-Ernst granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:19">[26:54:19]</a>, bipolar granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:05">[27:07:05]</a>, and metachromatic granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:05">[27:10:05]</a>. These granules contain polymetaphosphate, an energy source for the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:05">[30:33:05]</a>.

### Staining and Metachromasia
The Albert stain is used to visualize these granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:19:39">[27:19:39]</a>.
The chemicals used in Albert stain are toluidine blue, iodine, and malachite green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:15">[27:39:15]</a>.
With Albert stain:
*   The bacteria appear green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:07">[28:09:07]</a>.
*   The Valtan granules appear purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:09">[28:16:09]</a>.
This phenomenon is called metachromasia, where a stain (like toluidine blue) looks one color in the bottle (blue) but yields a different color under the microscope (purple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>. Toluidine blue is also a special stain for mast cells and basophils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:52">[29:50:52]</a>.

### Virulence Factors
[[corynebacterium_diphtheria_characteristics | Diphtheria toxin]] is a potent toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:30">[09:51:30]</a>.
It causes decreased protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:48">[16:40:48]</a> via ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:08">[17:46:08]</a>. This mechanism is also shared with *Pseudomonas* toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:31">[17:15:31]</a>.

## Culture Media
Two types of culture media are important for [[corynebacterium_diphtheria_characteristics | Corynebacterium diphtheria]]:
1.  **Enriched Culture Media**: Loeffler's serum slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:03">[31:17:03]</a>. It takes approximately 6-8 hours for bacteria to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:25:21">[31:25:21]</a>. This media is used for early diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:03">[32:18:03]</a>.
2.  **Selective Culture Media**:
    *   Potassium Tellurite Agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:40">[31:41:40]</a>. Tellurite gives a black color to the colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:23">[31:53:23]</a>. Growth takes approximately 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:07">[32:05:07]</a>. This is considered the best culture media for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:23:25">[32:23:25]</a>.
    *   Tinsdale Agar is another selective media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:22">[32:38:22]</a>.

## Diagnostic Tests
There are two main tests to assess diphtheria:
1.  **Elek Gel Precipitation Test**: This test determines the toxigenicity of the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>.
    *   A strip containing antitoxin is placed on a culture media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:14">[22:18:14]</a>.
    *   If the bacteria produce toxin, a reaction occurs with the antitoxin, forming precipitant lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:36">[22:42:36]</a>.
    *   Presence of lines indicates the bacteria are toxigenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Schick Test**: An intradermal test to determine patient susceptibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>.
    *   A positive Schick test (redness) indicates the patient is susceptible to diphtheria infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:08">[25:07:08]</a>.
    *   A negative Schick test means the patient is immune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:27">[25:18:27]</a>.
    *   The Schick test is a Type III hypersensitivity reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>.

## Treatment
Treatment for diphtheria involves:
*   **Droplet precautions**: Always maintained due to the spread via droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:14:04">[39:14:04]</a>.
*   **Antibiotics**: Penicillin and erythromycin are relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19:04">[39:19:04]</a>.
*   **Diphtheria Antitoxin (DAT)**:
    *   Usually given intramuscularly (IM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:08">[38:22:08]</a>.
    *   In cases of neck disease (bull's neck) or disease duration more than three days, half the dose is given IM and half intravenously (IV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>.
    *   Dosage ranges from 20,000 to 120,000 International Units, depending on the severity and type of disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00:23">[41:00:23]</a>. For pharyngeal disease, it's 20,000-40,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:00">[39:47:00]</a>; for nasopharyngeal disease, 40,000-60,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:00">[40:11:00]</a>; and for extensive disease, it can cross 100,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>.

## Other Corynebacterium Species
*   **Corynebacterium minutissimum**: Causes erythrasma (red rash) and shows a coral red color under Wood's lamp examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   **Corynebacterium ulcerans**: Can cause respiratory symptoms or lung disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.
*   **Corynebacterium jeikeium**: Known for causing endocarditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.
*   **Corynebacterium urealyticum** and **Corynebacterium jeikeium** are lipophilic (require lipids for growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. Most other Corynebacterium species are non-lipophilic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.
*   **Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis**: Primarily affects sheep, with rare human involvement in the lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.

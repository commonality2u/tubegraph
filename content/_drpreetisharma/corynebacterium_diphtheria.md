[[systemic_pathology_and_bacteriology | *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*]] is a [[Gram positive bacilli | gram-positive bacillus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. It is included in the "McDonald's" mnemonic for [[Gram positive bacilli | Gram Positive Bacilli]], representing the 'D' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

## Clinical Features

The classical presentation of [[corynebacterium_diphtheriae_characteristics_and_testing | diphtheria]] includes a sore throat, low-grade fever, and a thick membrane covering the tonsils and pharynx (pseudomembrane) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. The presence of this pseudomembrane is a key diagnostic feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. Another common clinical sign is a "bull's neck," caused by lymphadenopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

### Complications
The most common complication of [[corynebacterium_diphtheriae_characteristics_and_testing | diphtheria]] is myocarditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a>. This condition can lead to fat deposition in the heart, resulting in a "tiger-striped" or "tabby cat" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:29:00">[34:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>.

## Microbiology and Virulence Factors

### Morphology
*Corynebacterium diphtheriae* exhibits a unique "Chinese letter" or "cuneiform" arrangement when stained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>. It also possesses prominent "bulbous ends" containing large granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:00">[26:39:00]</a>.

### Granules
These granules are known by several names:
- Valtan granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>
- Babes-Ernst granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>
- Bipolar granules (present at two ends of the bacteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>
- Metachromatic granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>

Metachromatic staining is a property where a stain appears one color in the bottle but a different color under the microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>. Toluidine blue is a classic example of a metachromatic stain, appearing blue in the bottle but staining granules purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>. These granules store energy in the form of polymetaphosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>.

### Staining
Albert stain is used to visualize these granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>. The Albert stain involves three chemicals: toluidine blue, iodine, and malachite green (mnemonic: TIM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>. With Albert stain, the bacteria appear green, and the granules stain purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>.

### Toxin
*Corynebacterium diphtheriae* produces a potent diphtheria toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This toxin functions by decreasing protein synthesis through ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.

## Culture Media
Two main types of culture media are used for *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*:

1.  **Enriched Culture Media:**
    *   **Loeffler's serum slope:** Contains eggs, mineral salt solution, Fiersite green, and asparagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:00">[31:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:22]</a>. It is used for early diagnosis as growth appears in 6-8 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:00">[32:05:00]</a>. The medium often has a greenish hue due to its components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:00">[33:33:00]</a>.
2.  **Selective Culture Media:**
    *   **Potassium tellurite agar:** This media produces black colonies because tellurium is a metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>. However, growth takes 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Tinsdale agar:** Another selective medium for *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.

## Diagnostic Tests

### Elek Gel Precipitation Test
This test is used to determine the **toxigenicity** of the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>.
- A culture medium is prepared with a strip containing antitoxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:00">[22:18:00]</a>.
- If the cultured bacteria produce toxin, it reacts with the antitoxin on the strip, forming visible precipitant lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>.
- The presence of these lines indicates a toxigenic *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>.

### Schick Test
The Schick Test is an intradermal test used to assess the **susceptibility** of a patient to [[corynebacterium_diphtheriae_characteristics_and_testing | diphtheria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>.
- It is a Type III hypersensitivity reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.
- **Positive Schick test:** Indicated by redness at the injection site, meaning the patient is susceptible to the infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>.
- **Negative Schick test:** No reaction, meaning the patient is immune to [[corynebacterium_diphtheriae_characteristics_and_testing | diphtheria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:00">[25:18:00]</a>.

## Treatment
Treatment for [[corynebacterium_diphtheriae_characteristics_and_testing | diphtheria]] involves both antibiotics and antitoxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:39:00">[37:39:00]</a>.
- **Antibiotics:** Penicillin and erythromycin are relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19:00">[39:19:00]</a>.
- **Diphtheria Antitoxin (DAT):** The dosage varies depending on the severity and location of the disease, typically ranging from 20,000 to 120,000 International Units (IU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:00">[40:30:00]</a>.
    - For pharyngeal disease, 20,000-40,000 IU is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:00">[39:47:47]</a>.
    - For nasopharyngeal disease, 40,000-60,000 IU is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:54:00">[39:54:00]</a>.
    - For extensive disease, especially involving the neck or if the disease has been present for more than three days, the dosage can be 80,000-120,000 IU, often administered as half intramuscular (IM) and half intravenous (IV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:43:00">[40:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:49:00">[40:49:00]</a>.

### Prevention
Due to [[corynebacterium_diphtheriae_characteristics_and_testing | diphtheria]] spreading by droplet infection, droplet precautions are necessary for all patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:11:00">[39:11:00]</a>.

Tuberous Sclerosis is a syndrome associated with intellectual disability and seizures, which can correlate with cardiac tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This condition also presents with various other clinical manifestations across different organ systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Genetics
Tuberous Sclerosis is linked to mutations in two main genes:
*   **TSC1 gene** located on chromosome 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This gene codes for the protein **hamartin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **TSC2 gene** located on chromosome 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This gene codes for the protein **tuberin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations
A mnemonic to remember the findings of Tuberous Sclerosis is **ASHLEAF** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Dermatological Findings
*   **Ash-leaf spot**: A hypopigmented lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Shagreen patch**: Characterized by thick, leathery skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Angiofibroma** on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Cardiac Manifestations
*   [[cardiac_tumors | Rhabdomyoma]]: This is the most likely [[cardiac_tumors | cardiac tumor]] in a patient with intellectual disability and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. In children, Rhabdomyoma is the most common benign [[cardiac_tumors | primary cardiac tumor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Pulmonary Manifestations
*   **Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)**: This condition involves lymphatic vessels, blood vessels, and smooth muscle components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Neurological Manifestations
*   **Epilepsy**: A common finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Cortical tubers**: Seen in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   [[brain_tumor_case_study | Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)]]: This is a [[brain_tumor_case_study | CNS tumor]] that can occur in Tuberous Sclerosis patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The presence of these brain abnormalities explains the intellectual disability and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Renal Manifestations
*   **Angiomyolipoma (AML)**: Occurs in the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This is distinct from leukemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Associated Tumors
Many of the tumors associated with Tuberous Sclerosis, such as Rhabdomyoma, LAM, and Angiomyolipoma, are **hamartomatous tumors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This explains why skeletal muscle tumors (Rhabdomyoma) are found in the heart, and muscle and fat (Angiomyolipoma) are found in the kidneys, where they are not typically expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Histopathological Features
### Rhabdomyoma (Cardiac Tumor)
*   **Spider cells**: These cells are characteristic of rhabdomyoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **PAS positive**: The white areas within spider cells are PAS positive due to the presence of **glycogen** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

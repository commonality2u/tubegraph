Microscopy is a fundamental technique in [[basic_pathology_and_microbiology_concepts | microbiology]] and pathology for observing microorganisms and cellular structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Different types of microscopes offer unique advantages for various diagnostic and research purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Light Microscope
The light microscope is a common type used to observe samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Light Source**: It uses transmitted light, meaning light passes through the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Components** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:
    *   **Condenser**: A structure present below the stage that focuses light onto the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   **Stage**: The platform where the specimen slide is placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
    *   **Objective Lens**: Located near the object (specimen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Common magnifications include 4x, 10x, 40x, and 100x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   **Eyepiece Lens (Ocular Lens)**: The lens through which the observer looks, typically providing 10x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Total Magnification**: Calculated by multiplying the eyepiece magnification by the objective lens magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A typical maximum magnification for a light microscope is 1000x (10x eyepiece * 100x objective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Fluorescent Microscope
A fluorescent microscope looks similar to a light microscope but includes additional components like dichroic mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Light Source**: Utilizes ultraviolet (UV) light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Principle**: Dichroic mirrors convert short-wavelength light into longer-wavelength light, allowing fluorescently stained specimens to emit visible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Applications and Stains**:
    *   **TB (Mycobacterial)**: Auramine-rhodamine stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. *Note: Rhodamine (or Rhodanine) is specifically for copper staining in Wilson's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.*
    *   **Malaria**: Acridine orange stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   **Fungus**: Calcofluor white stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Electron Microscope
The electron microscope appears enclosed, resembling a "space rocket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: It operates by using electrons, not light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Environment**: Requires a vacuum to be maintained inside, which is why it is fully enclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Applications**: Viruses, which are too small to be seen with a normal light microscope, can be observed using an electron microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>.

## Dark Field Microscope
*   **Application**: Used for the diagnosis of syphilis, particularly when examining samples for *Treponema pallidum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>. This is often associated with clinical histories such as those involving truck drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

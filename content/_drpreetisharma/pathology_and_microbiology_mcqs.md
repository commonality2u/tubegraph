This article summarizes key pathology and microbiology concepts discussed in an active recall session, focusing on case-based questions and fill-in-the-blank exercises.

## Session Overview
This session is designed for [[Pathology study techniques and mnemonics | active recall]], testing knowledge after rapid revision and notes, often using a "fill in the blanks" approach to aid retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The session covers a mixed bag of topics in [[General Pathology and Immunology Topics | pathology]] and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Question 1: DiGeorge Syndrome
A 3-month-old male infant presents with severe muscle spasms and seizures, recurrent infections, and feeding difficulties. Physical examination reveals a dysmorphic face and cleft palate. Chest x-ray shows an absent thymic shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

**Diagnosis**: DiGeorge Syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

**Cause of Seizures**: Hypocalcemia due to decreased calcium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Catch-22 Mnemonic
DiGeorge Syndrome is associated with the Catch-22 mnemonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>:
*   **Deletion**: 22q11 deletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> (specifically 22q11 deletion for INI CET students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>).
    *   *Note*: A deletion of 11q22 affects chromosome 11 and is associated with Ataxia Telangiectasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Embryological Problem**: Affects the development of the thymus and parathyroid glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
    *   **Thymus not developed**: Leads to T-cell deficiency, resulting in recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. An absent thymic shadow is seen on chest X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   **Parathyroid not developed**: Leads to decreased parathyroid hormone, causing decreased calcium (hypocalcemia) and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Cleft Lip/Palate**: Patient presents with facial dysmorphism and cleft palate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

*   **Acute ITP**:
    *   **Age**: Occurs in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
    *   **History**: Often follows a viral infection (e.g., minor cold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
    *   **Platelet Count**: Around 50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
    *   **Prognosis**: Self-limiting, resolves within 6 months as antibodies clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. No active treatment needed.
*   **Chronic ITP**:
    *   **Age**: Occurs in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
    *   **History**: No viral history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.
    *   **Platelet Count**: Very low (e.g., 5,000-10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

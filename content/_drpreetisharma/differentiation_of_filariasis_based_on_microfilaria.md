Filariasis is a group of parasitic diseases caused by filarial worms. Identification of the specific type of filariasis often relies on the microscopic examination of microfilariae in blood or tissue samples, differentiating them based on features like the presence or absence of a sheath and the arrangement of nuclei in the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51">[02:51]</a>.

## Sheathed Microfilariae

The presence of a sheath, an orange-colored covering around the microfilaria, helps narrow down the possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[03:22]</a>. Three common sheathed microfilariae are:
*   *Wuchereria bancrofti* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04">[03:04]</a>
*   *Brugia malayi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a>
*   *Loa loa* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01">[03:01]</a>

These can be remembered by the mnemonic "LBW" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01">[03:01]</a>. Differentiation among these is based on the nuclei at the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35">[03:35]</a>.

### *Wuchereria bancrofti*

*   **Sheath:** Present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04">[03:04]</a>
*   **Tail Nuclei:** No nuclei at the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16">[03:16]</a>, appearing as if they have "vanished like magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Elephantiasis:** Characterized by a swollen limb due to lymphatic obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>. Lymphatic obstruction is the cause of elephantiasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44">[04:44]</a>.
    *   **Chyluria:** If lymphatic channels burst, lymph (chyle) mixes with urine, making the urine appear milky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>.

### *Brugia malayi*

*   **Sheath:** Present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a>
*   **Tail Nuclei:** Typically, two distinct nuclei are present at the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00">[04:00]</a>.

### *Loa loa*

*   **Sheath:** Present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01">[03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34">[06:34]</a>
*   **Tail Nuclei:** A continuous line of nuclei is seen right till the end of the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07">[04:07]</a>.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Also known as the "African eye worm" as the worm can be visibly seen in the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20">[06:20]</a>.
    *   **Calabar swelling:** A localized swelling and redness, typically on the hands, caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to the parasite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38">[06:38]</a>.

## Unsheathed Microfilariae

*   **Onchocerca volvulus** (Enko circa) is an unsheathed microfilaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>.
    *   **Sheath:** Absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>.
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   **Leopard skin or dermatitis:** Characterized by very black skin, often seen in the black population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25">[05:25]</a>.
        *   **River blindness:** Causes blindness due to sclerosing keratitis, where the eye appears entirely covered by a sheath-like structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56">[05:56]</a>.
        *   **Vector:** Transmitted by black flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42">[05:42]</a>.
        *   **Treatment:** Ivermectin is the drug of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12">[06:12]</a>.

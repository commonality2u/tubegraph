[[key_features_of_various_bacterial_toxins | Cholera toxin]] is produced by *Vibrio cholerae*, along with zonula occludens toxins (CODZOT), which contribute to the characteristic rice water stools seen in infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

## Cholera Toxin Fragments and Their Roles

[[key_features_of_various_bacterial_toxins | Cholera toxin]] consists of two main fragments: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>
*   **Fragment B (Binding)**: This fragment is responsible for binding to the intestinal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Specifically, it binds to the GM1 ganglioside on the surface of these cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
*   **Fragment A (Action)**: This fragment is responsible for the toxin's primary mechanism of action once inside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

## Intracellular Mechanism

Fragment A of the [[key_features_of_various_bacterial_toxins | cholera toxin]] primarily acts by activating adenylate cyclase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This activation leads to a significant increase in the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. The elevated cAMP levels disrupt normal ion and fluid transport in the intestinal cells, leading to excessive fluid secretion and the characteristic diarrhea associated with cholera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

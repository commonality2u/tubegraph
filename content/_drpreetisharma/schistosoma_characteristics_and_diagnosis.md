Schistosoma is a genus of trematodes. The discussion highlights key characteristics, modes of transmission, affected body regions, and diagnostic features of different *Schistosoma* species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>.

## General Characteristics
*   **Family** The organism belongs to the trematode family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.
*   **Mode of Transmission** *Schistosoma* is transmitted via skin penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. The infective form is the cercaria larva, which enters through the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.
*   **Adult Worms** Unlike some other trematodes, *Schistosoma* has separate sexes for its adult worms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
*   **Eggs** *Schistosoma* eggs are characterized by having spines and projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a>.

### Species-Specific Characteristics
Three main *Schistosoma* species are discussed, differentiated by their localization in the body and egg morphology:

*   **Schistosoma hematobium**
    *   **Localization**: Causes hematuria, as it localizes in the veins of the urinary bladder and pelvic plexus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
    *   **Egg Morphology**: Has a terminal spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

*   **Schistosoma mansoni**
    *   **Localization**: Localizes in the veins of the large intestine, specifically the rectosigmoid region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.
    *   **Egg Morphology**: Characterized by a lateral spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. A mnemonic for this is "man Sony sleeping lately" to remember its lateral spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

*   **Schistosoma japonicum**
    *   **Localization**: Localizes in the veins draining the ileocecal region (small intestine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.
    *   **Egg Morphology**: Has a rudimentary spine, meaning it's often not visible or looks round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis can involve identifying the characteristic eggs, which vary by species based on their spine location (terminal, lateral, or rudimentary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

## Treatment
The treatment for *Schistosoma* infection is Praziquantel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.

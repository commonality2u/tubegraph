This article outlines a detailed study plan and strategy for students preparing for the NEET PG exam on March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. It addresses key questions regarding daily targets, study schedules, and effective revision methods.

> [!NOTE] This session is specifically for students appearing for NEET PG on March 3rd, not for [[fmge_december_2024_exam_preparation_strategy | FMGE]] students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Daily Targets & Kick Start Morning Sessions

**Daily Targets (Pathology and Microbiology)**
Daily targets for Pathology (Path) and Microbiology (Micro) will be implemented immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. These targets will be provided in a topic-wise sheet, primarily aligning with topics listed in your Rapid Revision (RR) videos for Path and Micro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. If you are using another source, simply refer to those topics from your preferred material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. These daily targets are designed to help you cover these subjects consistently, even for short durations (e.g., 40 minutes daily), potentially saving dedicated days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

**Kick Start Morning Sessions**
"Kick Start Morning" sessions are early morning sessions, typically around 7:30 AM, designed to encourage students to wake up early and begin their day productively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These sessions will begin after students have completed one round of Path and Micro using their Rapid Revision (RR) videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The goal is to avoid wasting time by listening to material for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. These sessions will focus on MCQ-based discussions, not just theory, to integrate concepts effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Study Material: Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision

Choosing between main videos and rapid revision (RR) depends on your prior preparation:
*   If you have covered 85-90% of the syllabus at least once, prioritize Rapid Revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   However, for certain subjects, referring to main videos is still recommended given the time available until March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

**Subjects to Refer from Main Videos:**
*   **Third-year subjects:** Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, PSM. These are bulky, deadly, and yield many questions, often atypical ones, requiring in-depth information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Anatomy:** If you are weak in Anatomy, relying solely on RR can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Scary Subjects:** For subjects that are "nightmares" or cause lack of confidence (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology for some), consider using main videos to kill the "scare" and build a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

> [!TIP] Do not switch sources if you have already studied a subject thoroughly from another platform; stick to what you have already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

## Previous Year Topics (PYTs) & Questions (PYQs)

Focus on Previous Year Topics (PYTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. There are many helpful resources and compilations available online (e.g., Instagram posts, PYTG notes) so you don't need to search for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

**How many years of PYQs?**
*   **NEET PG:** Aim for at least five years of PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
*   **INI CET:** Focus on the last three years of INI CET PYQs, as NEET PG and INI CET have increasing overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
*   **FMGE:** Instead of solving question banks from scratch, watch dedicated PYQ discussion sessions (e.g., 2-hour videos on PrepLadder) which cover five years of questions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Relying *only* on PYQs will not guarantee a good rank; they are important but not the sole solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. Focus on PYQ *topics* alongside Rapid Revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

**Frequency & Time Allocation:**
*   Ideally, take one Grand Test every two weeks (fortnightly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   If GTs cause significant demotivation, reduce frequency to once every three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   Allocate half a day for a Grand Test. The 3.5 hours for the exam, and the remaining half-day for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

**GT Analysis:**
*   Do not spend too much time on explanations for *correct* questions, as you are already revising notes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Focus primarily on analyzing *incorrect* answers:
    *   Identify if it was a silly mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    *   Determine if you didn't know the topic or if it was new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
    *   Analyze *why* you got it wrong (e.g., factual, rote, conceptual, clinical questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   Avoid being overly "statistic-driven" (e.g., focusing only on how many incorrect or how much time taken) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The main purpose is to analyze mistakes and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Consider taking a baseline Grand Test today if you have nothing else to study. Do not judge yourself by the score; analyze incorrect answers and then rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Last Revision Round (LRR)

LRR for NEET PG will be conducted in January and February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. It aims to be finished by January so there's ample time for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Attending FMGE LRR sessions (in November/December) is also beneficial for NEET PG students, as they cover FMGE PYQs which can be done immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] LRR is excellent for end-month revision when complemented with Rapid Revision, but relying *only* on LRR (e.g., 4-6 hours per subject) from the beginning is not sufficient for a good rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

## Timetable for NEET PG 2024 Preparation

The timetable is structured into three rounds, covering the period until March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. It is designed to be "comfortable" and includes buffers for backlogs, Grand Tests, and unforeseen circumstances like illness or anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Question Practice

*   **Daily MCQ Target:** Aim to solve 100-150 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Start by gradually increasing from your current number (e.g., 5-10 questions more daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **Subject-wise Practice:** In Round 1, solve questions subject-wise or topic-wise as you study them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **QBank Usage:**
    *   **Bulky Subjects:** For subjects like Medicine, Surgery, Gynaecology, PSM, Anatomy, and Pharmacology, try to cover the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.
    *   **Short Subjects:** For shorter subjects, refer to the RR QBank and LRR sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **No Separate QBank Days:** QBank practice is integrated into the daily study schedule; there are no dedicated days for QBank alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

## Advice for Interns

Interns should follow the same subject sequence in the timetable but **add one extra day** to each subject due to limited study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
*   **Source:** Focus *only* on Rapid Revision notes/videos and QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. Do not refer to main videos for every subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.
*   **Short Subjects:** Prioritize finishing short subjects quickly (e.g., Psych, Radio, Ortho, Anesthesia, Forensic, Skin). Utilize lighter posting periods during internship to cover these subjects, aiming to complete 5-6 subjects in 7-8 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. This provides a significant confidence boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
*   **Path/Micro Daily Targets:** Follow the daily targets for Path and Micro consistently, even during work (e.g., 40 minutes while working) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

## Mindset and Motivation

*   **Confidence:** Don't let exam results or past performance define your current potential. Focus on present efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. Increase question practice to build confidence, as numbers often provide this assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.
*   **Address Weaknesses:** Confront your "nightmare subjects" (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology). Instead of avoiding them, dedicate sufficient time (e.g., 4-5 days) to study them thoroughly from notes/main videos and practice questions to overcome the fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.
*   **Action Over Complaining:** You likely already know your weak areas and what you need to do to improve. The challenge is taking action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Practicality:** The timetable is designed to be realistic, accounting for bad days, emergencies, anxiety, and backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
*   **Breaks:** For effective studying, gradually increase study stretches to 2.5-3 hours to simulate exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. After a long stretch, a 15-minute break is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. Avoid excessive short breaks (like Pomodoro) at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.
*   **Daily Output:** If you are consistently achieving 10-11 hours of pure study output per day, that is excellent; do not feel pressured to increase it or exhaust yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Your attitude should be: "I have these many days in hand, this is my situation now, tell me what to do, and I will do it with full honesty and dedication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. Don't waste more time dwelling on past bad results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

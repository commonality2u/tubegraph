## Clinical Presentation of Gardia lamblia Infection
A 28-year-old individual presenting with persistent watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and dehydration may suggest a parasitic infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Standard stool examinations may not always reveal trophozoites in such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## The String Test (Entero-test)

The string test is a diagnostic procedure primarily used for identifying [[giardia_lamblia_and_string_test_procedure | Gardia lamblia]] infections, particularly when stool examination is inconclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. [[giardia_lamblia_and_string_test_procedure | Gardia lamblia]] commonly resides in the duodenum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Procedure
1.  A patient swallows a capsule containing a coiled string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
2.  The capsule travels through the digestive tract to the duodenum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
3.  One end of the string remains outside the patient's mouth, typically secured with tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
4.  After a specified period, the string is carefully pulled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
5.  Any contents collected on the string from the duodenum are then examined under a microscope to identify [[giardia_lamblia_and_string_test_procedure | Gardia lamblia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

The string test is specifically designed for diagnosing small intestinal infections by collecting duodenal contents, primarily for [[giardia_lamblia_and_string_test_procedure | Giardia lamblia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Differentiation from other "String Tests"
It is important to distinguish the clinical string test used for [[giardia_lamblia_and_string_test_procedure | Gardia lamblia]] from other "string tests" performed in a microbiology laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Laboratory string tests are conducted on cultures or plates, for instance, for organisms like *Vibrio cholerae* (associated with rice water stools) and *Klebsiella* (often *Klebsiella pneumoniae*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

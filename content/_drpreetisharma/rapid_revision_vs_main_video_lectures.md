When preparing for exams like NEET PG, students often deliberate between using full-length main video lectures and shorter rapid revision videos. The choice largely depends on the student's current preparation level, available time, and learning style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Choosing Your Learning Material

### General Guidance
Main video lectures are primarily for initial understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>. Once you have a foundational grasp of a subject, subsequent revisions should focus on actively recalling information from your notes rather than re-watching lengthy videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>. Repeatedly watching videos after the first review can lead to overconfidence without actual [[active_recall_and_study_techniques | active recall]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. If you encounter a topic you don't understand during revision, you can refer back to the specific part of the main video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.

### For Freshers and First-Time Exam Takers
If you are taking the exam for the first time or are currently in your internship, a subject-wise approach is recommended for your first read or revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:08">[06:07:08]</a>. A system-wise approach might lead to missing general concepts across subjects like General Pathology, General Microbiology, General Pharmacology, General Surgery, or Biochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

If your basic concepts are not strong, begin with [[rapid_revision_versus_main_videos | rapid revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>. If you get stuck on a particular topic, pause the [[rapid_revision_versus_main_videos | rapid revision]] video, quickly refer to the corresponding main video for that specific topic, and then return to [[rapid_revision_versus_main_videos | rapid revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>. This way, you don't waste time on regret and maintain momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[29:46:00]</a>.

### For Repeaters or Those with Completed Syllabus
If this is your second, third, or fourth revision and you have already completed your entire syllabus, then a system-wise study approach can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:04">[05:32:04]</a>.

### For Interns and Working Doctors
Interns and working doctors will find it challenging to cover main videos due to time constraints, as main videos typically require 12 hours or more of daily study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. For this group, it is strongly advised to rely heavily on [[rapid_revision_versus_main_videos | rapid revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>. If you encounter a topic you don't understand within the [[rapid_revision_versus_main_videos | rapid revision]] content, you can fall back to the main videos for that specific point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.

## Subject-Specific Recommendations

### Pathology and Microbiology
For NEET PG students, it is recommended to opt for [[key_pathology_concepts_and_revisions | rapid revision]] videos for Pathology (approximately 20 hours) and Microbiology (approximately 15 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. If you have previously used [[rapid_revision_techniques_and_subject_prioritization | Rapid Revision 5.0]], stick to it and only check the PDF file for topics added in [[rapid_revision_techniques_and_subject_prioritization | Rapid Revision 6.0]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. If you are new to the videos, go directly for [[rapid_revision_techniques_and_subject_prioritization | Rapid Revision 6.0]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

Rapid revision notes are often sufficient, and you generally won't need to revert to main notes for Pathology and Microbiology after completing the rapid revision videos and main Q Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. The content is similar, just more consolidated in rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>.

### Ophthalmology (Ophthal) and ENT
These subjects can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>. If you previously did main videos for Ophthalmology a long time ago, shifting to [[rapid_revision_versus_main_videos | rapid revision]] is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>. If you struggle significantly with Ophthalmology, consider doing main videos; otherwise, [[rapid_revision_versus_main_videos | rapid revision]] followed by extensive MCQ solving is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>.

### Anatomy
If Anatomy is overwhelming or intimidating, consider studying it alongside allied subjects like Orthopedics, Surgery, and Radiology. These subjects will repeatedly reinforce anatomical concepts, aiding in retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>.

### Medicine
Medicine is an extensive subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. Instead of dedicating a large block of days to it, it is suggested to study Medicine for 1 to 1.5 hours daily alongside other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. This approach makes it less overwhelming and provides daily "clinical exposure" for NEET PG preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This requires discipline, so if consistent daily study is an issue, allocate separate dedicated days for Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

### Physiology
It is advised to study Physiology later in your revision cycle, perhaps even towards the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. Many Physiology concepts integrate with other subjects like Pathology and Medicine, making it easier to cover once you have studied other clinical topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.

## Number of Revisions
The exact number of revisions required depends on the exam date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>. The first reading should be comprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>. Subsequent revisions should progressively narrow down the material, moving from [[rapid_revision_techniques_and_subject_prioritization | rapid revision]] to filtered topics and eventually focusing only on [[rapid_revision_techniques_and_subject_prioritization | volatile topics]] in the last 10-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Volatile Topics
> Maintain a personal notebook of volatile topics and Grand Test (GT) mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. This "20th notebook" should only list topics and references (e.g., "incubation periods: read from [[rapid_revision_versus_main_videos | Rapid revision]]", "Hepatitis B graph: read from [[rapid_revision_versus_main_videos | Rapid revision]]"), not extensive re-written text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Avoid relying on others' volatile topic lists, as what one person forgets differs from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. This personalized list will be crucial for quick review in the final days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## Question Bank Usage
If you've completed one round of revision, your daily 1-hour custom module should include all subjects, functioning as a mini-Grand Test of about 50 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. Alternatively, you can alternate between clinical subjects and first/second-year subjects for your custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.

For first-time learners, it's advisable to do the full Q Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. If you've already done one round of revision, then an [[active_recall_and_question_bank_usage | RRQ bank]] can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>.

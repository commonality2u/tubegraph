[[active_recall_and_effective_study_methods | Active recall]] is a study method that involves testing oneself to see how much information can be remembered after reading notes or undergoing [[Rapid Revision Techniques for FMGE | rapid revision]] and Q-bank sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The core idea of [[active_recall_and_effective_study_methods | active recall]] is to ask oneself questions and fill in blanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This approach makes recalling information significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

> "active recall means you've read everything you've done your rapid revision you've done your notes your you know Q bank and now you need to test yourself you need to be able to see that how much of it are you able to recall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

## Implementation in Study Sessions
The session itself is structured as an [[active_recall_and_effective_study_methods | active recall]] exercise, often termed "fill in the blanks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
In this method, information is hidden, and students are prompted to recall and provide the missing details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This active engagement helps in better retention and understanding of topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Examples of Active Recall in Practice
*   **Case Studies and Diagnostic Challenges** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>:
    *   For a patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of DiGeorge syndrome, students are asked to identify the cause of seizures and recall the "Catch-22" mnemonic, including the specific chromosome deletion (22q11) and affected organs (thymus, parathyroid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. They must also recall the associated T-cell deficiency leading to recurrent infections, hypocalcemia, dysmorphic facies, cleft palate, and cardiac abnormalities like Tetralogy of Fallot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   Identifying [[Case studies and diagnostic challenges | koilocytes]] in Pap smears involves recalling their characteristic features (razinoid nucleus, perinuclear halo) and linking them to HPV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This also extends to recalling the roles of HPV proteins (L1 for vaccine, E4/E5 for koilocyte formation, E6/E7 for inactivating tumor suppressor genes p53 and retinoblastoma gene) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Genetic Disorders**:
    *   For Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), students are prompted to recall the defect (NADPH oxidase, *CYBB* gene mutation), inheritance patterns (X-linked recessive and autosomal recessive), and diagnostic tests (NBT, DHR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
    *   In the context of DNA repair defects, students must recall the specific syndromes associated with nucleotide excision repair (Xeroderma Pigmentosum) and mismatch repair (HNPCC/Lynch syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. They also need to recall the mnemonic "BIG FACTS" for autosomal recessive conditions like Bloom syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Ataxia-telangiectasia, and Xeroderma Pigmentosum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
*   **Microbiology and Parasitology**:
    *   For *Schistosoma* species, students are asked to recall the mode of transmission (skin penetration), infective form (cercaria larva), separate sexes of adult worms, and spinous eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. They also differentiate species based on egg morphology (terminal spine for *hematobium*, lateral spine for *mansoni*, rudimentary spine for *japonicum*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.
    *   Recalling the characteristic appearance of *Malassezia furfur* (spaghetti and meatball or banana and grapes appearance) in KOH mounts and its requirement for olive oil in culture media due to its lipophilic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.

## Benefits of Active Recall
The "fill in the blanks" format directly engages the brain in retrieving information, which is more effective for long-term retention than passive reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This method helps to:
*   Test understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   Enhance recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   Strengthen memory pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>

This approach is highly recommended for exam preparation, especially for subjects like pathology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

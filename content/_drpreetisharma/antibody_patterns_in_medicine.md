Antibody patterns are crucial for diagnosing various medical conditions, especially autoimmune diseases. These patterns are typically identified using [[Immunofluorescence and Pathology Imaging Techniques | immunofluorescence]] techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) Patterns
Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) patterns are frequently encountered in diagnostic pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. A mnemonic "HAPPENS" can help remember the common patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>:

*   **Homogenous Pattern** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>
    *   Appearance: Appears uniformly green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
    *   Associated with: Antibodies against dsDNA, histone, and other nuclear components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Peripheral Pattern** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>
    *   Appearance: More green at the periphery, resembling DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
    *   Associated with: Anti-dsDNA antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Nucleolar Pattern** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>
    *   Appearance: Seen as one distinct dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
    *   Associated with: Antibodies against RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Speckled Pattern** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>
    *   Appearance: Characterized by numerous small dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
    *   Significance: It is the most common pattern and is non-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
    *   Seen in: [[Autoimmune hepatitis and diagnostic challenges | SLE]], Sjogren's syndrome, and other [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia diagnosis | autoimmune]] diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Centromeric Pattern** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>
    *   Associated with: Anti-centromeric antibodies, often seen in CREST syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

## Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA) Patterns
ANCA patterns are detected using [[Immunofluorescence and Pathology Imaging Techniques | immunofluorescence]] and help differentiate various vasculitides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:41">[02:00:41]</a>.

*   **C-ANCA (Cytoplasmic ANCA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>
    *   Appearance: Shows green fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:59">[02:10:59]</a>. The nucleus remains distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:02">[02:10:02]</a>.
    *   Other Name: PR3-ANCA (Proteinase 3 ANCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>.
    *   Specific for: [[Classification systems in medical fields | Wegener Granulomatosis]] (now Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:21">[02:12:21]</a>.
*   **P-ANCA (Perinuclear ANCA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:08">[02:13:08]</a>
    *   Appearance: Green fluorescence concentrated around the nucleus, forming a perinuclear boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>.
    *   Other Name: MPO-ANCA (Myeloperoxidase ANCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:36">[02:13:36]</a>.
    *   Seen in:
        *   [[Classification systems in medical fields | Microscopic Polyangiitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:45">[02:14:45]</a>
        *   Churg-Strauss Syndrome (now Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>
        *   [[Classification systems in medical fields | Ulcerative Colitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:58">[02:15:58]</a>
        *   Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:11">[02:16:11]</a>
        *   Can also be positive in [[Classification systems in medical fields | Crohn's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:01">[02:17:01]</a>.

While C-ANCA is very specific to [[Classification systems in medical fields | Wegener Granulomatosis]], P-ANCA is less loyal and can be seen in various conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>.

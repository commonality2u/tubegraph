Effective preparation for the [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | FMGE exam]] requires a balanced approach to theory and practice questions (MCQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Given the exam date on January 20th, candidates have approximately two months and an additional week for preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Integrating MCQs with Theory

It is crucial to practice MCQs concurrently with theory, rather than attempting to complete all theory before moving to questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Every day, as you study theory, MCQs must be done side-by-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Sources for Questions

For question practice, candidates should utilize:
*   **A Q-bank of choice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It is recommended to use any existing subscription or platform you are already familiar with, rather than purchasing new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Focus on understanding the *topics* from previous years, not just rote memorization of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. For example, if "apoptosis" has appeared multiple times, study the apoptosis topic thoroughly from your pathology notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This can be done via apps or [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | FMGE solutions]] textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### PYQs from Other Exams
It is beneficial to attempt PYQs from NEET PG and AIIMS/INI CET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>. Focus on the last three years for NEET PG and recent exams for AIIMS/INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.

## Daily MCQ Targets

Aim for **100+ MCQs per day** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This target can be achieved by solving questions related to the theory chapters you are studying daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. If you find it difficult to reach 100 questions immediately, start with 50 and gradually increase by 5-7 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Within a week to a half, you should be able to reach the 100-mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

### Focus on Topics, Not Just Numbers
Do not get too bogged down by the number of questions per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. The focus should be on finishing topics, and the number of questions solved will naturally follow, whether it's 10 or 100 for a particular topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.

## The Role of Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision (RR)

Given the limited time, the primary focus should be on [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | Rapid Revision]] videos and notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Use Main Videos Strategically**: Refer to main videos *only* to clarify concepts that are unclear or to resolve doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. For example, if a concept in microbiology isn't clear from RR, open the main video, watch for 10 minutes to clarify, then return to RR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Avoid starting with Main Videos**: Do not attempt to cover all subjects from 70-80 hour main videos at this stage, as it's not practical within 65 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.
*   **Pathology and Microbiology**: For subjects like Pathology and Microbiology, [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | Rapid Revision]] is considered sufficient for the [[fmge_january_2024_exam_strategy | FMGE January 2024 Exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. Daily targets for these subjects will be provided during the second round of [[revision_techniques_for_fmge_exam | revision]] after December 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

Grand Tests are essential for improving [[time_management_and_study_techniques_for_fmge | time management]] and identifying areas of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
*   **Minimum GTs**: Aim to take at least **five Grand Tests** before the January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   **Purpose of GTs**: The primary goals of GTs are:
    1.  **Time Management**: Learn to manage time effectively during the exam, ensuring you can attempt all questions and revisit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. Maintain a pace of approximately 45-50 seconds per question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
    2.  **Analysis of Incorrect Questions**: Focus analysis on questions you got incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Read explanations from your chosen source (app, solution book) for these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   **Analysis of Correct Questions**: There's no need to read lengthy explanations for correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Briefly review your notes for the topic to reinforce the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Scores in GTs**: Do not get disheartened by GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Platform GTs are often designed to be slightly tougher (5-10 marks less than actual exam) to encourage continued study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. A score of 150+ in GTs suggests you could aim for 170-180 in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
*   **Avoiding GTs in Last 15 Days**: It's acceptable not to give GTs in the last 15 days before the exam to avoid unnecessary tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. However, continue solving other questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

## Revision Strategy and Notes

*   **Make Your Own Notes Concise**: During [[revision_techniques_for_fmge_exam | revision]], highlight only the most important 5 words per page in your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. This ensures that on the last day, you only need to read the highlighted words for quick review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
*   **Accept Forgetting**: It's normal to forget things, even for experienced faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. This is a human tendency; accept it and continue the cycle of reading, forgetting, and re-reading until the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   **Image-Based Questions (IBQs)**: IBQs are important and can help you answer questions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. While their number fluctuates, they are consistently part of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.
*   **Mixed Bag Questions**: Expect a mix of one-liner and clinical questions in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

## Dedicated Study Hours

Students should aim for **at least 10-12 effective hours of study per day** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. If you sit for 12 hours, expect an output of 10 effective hours, accounting for distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Daily Routine and [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | Study Schedule]]

*   **No Breathing Space**: Post-Diwali, there is no more breathing space for relaxation; it's time to get back to studies immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Medicine as a Daily Subject**: Do not dedicate a block of days solely to Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Instead, dedicate **1 to 1.5 hours daily** to Medicine starting from November 23rd, continuing until January 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This ensures continuous engagement with the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This approach is eased by having covered 40-50% of medicine topics in pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects**: Keep volatile subjects like Biochemistry, Anatomy, and Pharmacology closer to the exam date, dedicating two days each for their [[revision_techniques_for_fmge_exam | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Aim for at least six hours of sleep for proper mental functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. The adequate number of hours is when you wake up feeling 100% focused and not tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

## Dealing with Stress and Negativity

*   **Maintain Positivity**: Avoid falling into negative loops or listening to rumors about exam difficulty or pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. Focus on your daily tasks and believe that things will fall into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Self-Motivation**: External motivation is temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. True dedication comes from within, driven by your personal goals and the desire to change your life after January 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.
*   **Self-Belief**: Recognize your achievements, such as reaching MBBS, and stop self-doubting your abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>. You have the logical and reasoning abilities to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.
*   **Physical and Mental Health**: Dedicate 30-40 minutes daily to physical activity like walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. For mental health, practices like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help keep your heart rate normal and manage anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

## Customizing the [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | Time Table]]

*   **Flexibility**: The provided [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | time table]] serves as a general guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. You can adjust the order of subjects based on your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage Prior Preparation**: If you have already completed [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | Rapid Revision]] for all 19 subjects, you have an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. Use this by either finishing subjects faster or utilizing the extra time for additional questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
*   **Higher Scores**: For those aiming for 200+ scores, try to reduce the allocated days for subjects in the time table (e.g., a 4-day subject in 2.5-3 days) to free up 10 extra days for an additional round of [[revision_techniques_for_fmge_exam | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.
*   **Existing Schedules**: If you are already following another [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | time table]] that is working for you, stick to it and incorporate good points from this guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Difficult Subjects**: If you are particularly scared of subjects like Pharma, Anatomy, Biochemistry, or Microbiology, consider tackling them early in the week to get them out of the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.

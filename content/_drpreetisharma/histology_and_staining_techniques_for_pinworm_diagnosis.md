[[enterobius_vermicularis_identification | Enterobius vermicularis]], commonly known as pinworm, is a parasitic helminth that can be identified through [[microbiological_and_histological_examination_techniques | histological examination]] and [[types_of_staining_techniques_for_diagnosing_infections | specific staining techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. While often an incidental finding, it can occasionally be associated with [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | pathological conditions]] such as appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

## Histological Identification of Worms
When examining tissue samples, particularly from the appendix, the presence of *Enterobius vermicularis* can be identified by distinct morphological features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

Key identifying features of the adult worm include:
*   **Lateral Cuticular Alae** The most crucial feature is the presence of two lateral cuticular alae, which appear as pointed projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   **Location** Worms are typically found within the lumen of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Associated Histology** In the appendix, alongside the worm, one can observe the organ's normal histology, including the lining, goblet cells, and dense lymphoid aggregates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Diagnosis of Enterobius Eggs
The diagnosis of *Enterobius vermicularis* largely relies on the identification of its characteristic eggs.

### Egg Morphology
*   **Plano-Convex Shape** The eggs are classically described as plano-convex, appearing flat on one side and convex on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   **Tadpole Larva** Inside the egg, a tadpole larva is typically visible as a line-like structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

### Diagnostic Technique
*   **Cellulose Tape Method** The most common method for collecting *Enterobius* eggs is the cellulose tape method, also known as tape preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This technique is used to collect eggs from the perianal region, where adult female worms migrate to lay them, often causing pruritus (perianal itching) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Staining and Visualization
Eggs can be visualized using various [[key_staining_techniques_in_microbiology | staining methodologies]]:
*   **Ultraviolet Light** Under ultraviolet light, the plano-convex *Enterobius* egg presents a specific appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Pap Stain** When stained with a Pap stain, the plano-convex egg and the internal tadpole larva are clearly discernible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis: Acute Appendicitis vs. Periappendicitis
In the context of appendectomy specimens, it is crucial to differentiate between true [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | acute appendicitis]] and periappendicitis, especially when inflammation is present. [[Medical imaging in pathology and microbiology | Imaging]] can show an enlarged appendix, but histological examination is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

*   **Acute Appendicitis** The definitive histological criterion for diagnosing acute appendicitis is the presence of neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate within the muscularis propria (muscle layer) of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. Neutrophils are characteristic cells of acute inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   **Periappendicitis** If inflammation (e.g., neutrophilic infiltrate) is observed only in the serosa (outer layer) of the appendix, it indicates periappendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This implies that inflammation has extended onto the appendix from a surrounding source, rather than originating within the appendix itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. A common cause in females is acute salpingitis, an inflammation of the fallopian tube that can extend to the appendix serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **Perforation Appendix** In cases of perforated appendicitis, a proper muscle layer would not be discernible due to tissue destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

The primary purpose of exam preparation sessions is to impart knowledge and help ease students' nerves, especially as an exam like the FMG is approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Last-Minute Study Strategies

In the very few days remaining before an exam, it is advised to focus on specific, concise review materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Avoid Main Videos:** Students should not watch main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision Videos:** Even [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | rapid revision videos]] might not be the most efficient use of time at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on LRR Sessions:** Concentrating on specific, concise sessions like "LRR" (Last Minute Revision) is recommended for subjects like pathology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Once a session is completed, there is no need to revise it again immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Passive Learning:** If self-study becomes difficult, passive learning, such as attending classes or listening to lectures, is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Managing Exam Anxiety and Mindset

[[managing_exam_day_stress_and_anxiety | Keeping nerves calm]] is one of the most critical aspects of preparation, more so than just mugging up previous year questions or revision materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Breathing Exercises:** Before starting study sessions, taking deep breaths can help in staying calm until the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Calming Down:** Students must work to calm themselves down before they can effectively study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Avoid Unnecessary Stress:** Students should not pressure themselves unnecessarily, especially if they have already studied well and know the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Confidence vs. Overconfidence:** While confidence is good, overconfidence should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Focus on Positives:** It's important to focus on straightforward questions and positive aspects rather than dwelling on challenging or negative ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   **Exam Day Focus:** During the exam, maintaining a full focus on the current question will lead to automatic recall of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.
*   **Shared Experience:** Many students feel anxious or that they've forgotten everything, which is a common experience before exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. Attending short sessions can help realize that others share similar feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.
*   **Mindset is Key:** In the final days, mindset is crucial. A composed state helps clear the exam, whereas panic can lead to forgetting what has been studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

## Session Guidelines

For effective learning during review sessions:
*   **Avoid Fast Playback:** It is advised not to watch sessions at 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The speaker maintains a fast pace to cover material efficiently, suitable for a revision stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Hold Miscellaneous Doubts:** Students should hold their general doubts (e.g., "is this for FMG or NEET?", "should I read or not?") until the end of the session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Exam-going students can leave once the core content is finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Stay Concentrated:** The aim is to provide concentrated material for exam-going students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Final Days Planning

*   **Daily Sessions:** Engaging in daily short sessions helps maintain momentum and reduces tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Study:** Students should study dedicatedly, creating a timetable and allocating time for sleep, rest, and outdoor walks for relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.
*   **Pre-Exam Tips:** One day before the exam, a short session will be held for good luck, general tips, and [[time_management_and_study_hours_for_exams | time management]] advice, without focusing on new study material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.
*   **Review LRR PDFs:** For questions on topics previously covered in LRR sessions, students should refer to the LRR PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. Specifically, November and December LRR for FMG students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.

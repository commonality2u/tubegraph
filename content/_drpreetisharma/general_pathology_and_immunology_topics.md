General Pathology and Immunology are crucial subjects for medical examinations like NEET PG, FMG, and INI CET, often overlapping in content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. While [[pathology_and_microbiology_mcqs | Pathology and Microbiology]] share many common topics, INI CET may have a slightly separate set of topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Core General Pathology Chapters
A "General Path Mega Quiz" will cover four main chapters:
*   Cell Injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   Inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   Genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   Neoplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

## Immunology
Immunology is considered a separate and important topic, distinct from the core general pathology chapters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It will be covered in a dedicated session, especially before the INI CET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Specialized Pathology Topics for INI CET
For the INI CET, specific and often procrastinated topics in Pathology and Microbiology will be covered, including:
*   Flow Cytometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>
*   Immunohistochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>
*   Electron Microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>
*   Meningitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>
*   Culture Media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>
*   Microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>
*   Bacterial Genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>

## Study Aids and Resources
*   **Pathology Stains A to Z Series:** A planned series will cover [[pathology_study_techniques_and_mnemonics | pathology stains]] alphabetically, with quick 30-second explanations for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Drug of Choice Diaries:** This involves daily flashcards and quizzes on Telegram to help remember pharmacology-related drugs of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Main Videos & Rapid Revision:** For comprehensive preparation, main videos are recommended for 2025 aspirants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:3:37">[01:3:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:3:42">[01:3:42]</a>. Rapid Revision videos cover about 85% of microbiology content, with the remaining 15% needing to be covered through Q-bank practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Q-Bank Practice:** Essential for covering the remaining 15% of microbiology content not fully covered in rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. It helps in understanding "tricky" questions and specific details not present in core notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

### Preparation Strategy
Students are advised to practice as many Q-bank questions as possible from any available Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. When facing challenging questions, it's recommended to spend an extra 20-30 seconds to solve them correctly rather than panicking, as time can be recovered from easier questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>.

## Future Plans
*   **Hematology:** The Hematology section is planned to be completed before May 19th, after General Pathology and Immunology are wrapped up in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This will involve sitting for 2-3 hours for weekly or bi-weekly classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>.
*   **Ultra Rapid Revision Phase Two:** After INI CET, a second phase of ultra-rapid revision will commence, potentially involving more classes per week to cover more content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

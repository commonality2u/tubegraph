Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a DNA virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> commonly associated with various conditions, including cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis
A cervical Pap smear may reveal characteristic cellular changes, such as the presence of koilocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. A koilocyte is identified by a shriveled, "raisinoid" nucleus and a perinuclear halo, which appears as whitening around the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The E4 and E5 proteins of HPV are responsible for the formation of koilocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Types of HPV and Associated Conditions
HPV types are categorized based on their risk of causing cancer:
*   **Low-risk HPVs** These include types 6 and 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. They typically cause warts, also known as condyloma accuminatum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   **High-risk HPVs** These include types 16 and 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. They are commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Mechanism of Carcinogenesis
HPV causes cancer through the inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Specifically, two viral proteins, E6 and E7, are responsible for this oncogenic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>:
*   **E6 Protein** E6 inactivates the P-53 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, a tumor suppressor gene often referred to as the "policeman" of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   **E7 Protein** E7 inactivates the RB gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, another critical tumor suppressor gene referred to as the "governor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

By suppressing these key tumor suppressor genes (P-53 and RB), HPV promotes uncontrolled cell growth, leading to cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## HPV Vaccine
The L1 capsid protein of HPV is utilized for the preparation of HPV vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

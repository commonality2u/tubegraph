This article provides essential tips and strategies for students preparing for the [[FMGE January 2024 preparation strategy | FMGE January 20th exam]], focusing on the crucial last 10 days leading up to it. It is specifically tailored for FMG students, not for [[NEET PG preparation strategy | NEET PG]] or IAI students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Overall Approach: Do's and Don'ts

The last 10 days are a "make or break" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Your plan of action should focus on specific [[strategies_for_the_last_10_days_before_the_exam | strategies for the last 10 days]] to maximize your chances of success.

### Key Do's

*   **Prioritize Remaining Subjects**: It's common not to have finished all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Make a list of completed and leftover subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. For unfinished subjects, do not study new, extensive material. Instead, focus on 3-hour LRR (Last-minute Rapid Revision) sessions or crash courses available on platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The goal is to know enough to solve at least 50% of questions from any subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Normalize Sleep Cycle**: Ensure you are alert during the exam hours (morning hours) by normalizing your sleep cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Aim for a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **Strategic Grand Tests (GTs)**: If you choose to take GTs, focus on time management and catching silly mistakes, rather than the score itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. If your score is low, avoid panic and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. You can also create custom MCQ sets (e.g., 300 MCQs) to simulate the exam pattern and practice time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Effective MCQ Practice**:
    *   If an MCQ is correct, do not read the explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   If an MCQ is wrong, superficially read the explanation to understand if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Quickly review 5-10 lines on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   Expect 20-30 "bouncer" questions in any grand test or actual exam; do not let them deter you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Focus on the questions you *do* know and avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Maintain Positivity**: Surround yourself with people who give positive vibes (parents, siblings, good friends, teachers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Avoid negative people or those spreading illogical rumors about the exam's difficulty or pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

### Key Don'ts

*   **Don't Study Anything Entirely New** (for subjects you've already covered): Avoid diving into rare topics of subjects you've already studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Don't Leave Any Subject Completely**: You must know at least a little about all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Don't Over-rely on GT Scores**: Do not let a low GT score demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The target score of 150+ is for the actual exam, not the GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Don't Experiment with Medications**: Do not take new medications or experiment with your routine right before the exam, as you don't know the side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   **Don't Think About Future Outcomes**: Focus only on the next few hours of study, not what will happen in 5 days or on exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>.

## Subject Management in the Last 9 Days

For [[effective_time_table_creation_for_fmge | effective time table creation]], divide subjects into categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>:

1.  **Short Subjects**: Allocate approximately 2.5 days for subjects like ENT, Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, Dermatology, and Ophthalmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Focus on LRR sessions (e.g., YouTube's 3-hour LRR) and all previous year questions (PYQs) and topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
2.  **Volatile Subjects ("Giants")**: These include Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. No one can truly memorize all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Focus on LRR sessions and PYQ topics. Even for difficult subjects like Pharmacology, aim to solve 7-8 out of 15 questions, which is better than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
3.  **Clinical Subjects**: This category includes Medicine, Surgery, OBGYN, Pathology, and Physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. For these, also prioritize PYQ topics and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

The overall goal is to become a "scanning machine," quickly reviewing everything you have already read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

## Daily Schedule Division

Divide your day into four main time slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>:

1.  **Study Pattern (Theory and MCQs)**: This will take the majority of your day. Divide your study time into 60% for MCQs and 40% for theory. When doing MCQs, explanations serve as theory revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
2.  **Images**: Dedicate one hour daily to image revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. At the end of the day, quickly scan through all photos related to the subjects you studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. A dedicated [[pathology_image_revision_for_fmg_exam | Pathology image revision for FMG exam]] session or similar for other subjects can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
3.  **Sanity/Break Time**: Allocate 30 minutes daily for personal sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Ideally, engage in an outdoor activity like a light walk, or simply step away from your books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Avoid converting this into a longer break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

### Study Hours and MCQ Quantity

*   **Study Hours**: Aim for a minimum of 12-14 hours of *productive* study daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Productive means full concentration, keeping the phone aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. If you can complete your daily targets in fewer hours (e.g., 8-9 hours), that's an advantage; don't feel pressured by others' study durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **MCQ Quantity**: Based on previous successful students, aim for at least 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Gradually increase your daily MCQ count by 10-15 questions if you start at a lower number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Focus on MCQs related to previous year *topics*, as questions themselves are no longer simply copied and pasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

## Addressing Common Concerns

*   **Forgetting Subjects**: It's normal to feel like you're forgetting things, especially volatile subjects like Pharmacology or Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. This is common; everyone experiences it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. The solution is to quickly pick up and revise the forgotten material, focusing on LRR and PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Anxiety and Exhaustion**: Mental exhaustion and depression can lead to increased sleepiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. The goal is to remain mentally stable and avoid negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
*   **GT Scores**: If your GT score is between 130-150, analyze where you are making mistakes: silly mistakes (requiring more MCQ practice) or knowledge gaps (requiring revision of LRR notes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.
*   **Last Day Revision**: On the day before the exam, focus on volatile subjects and topics you tend to forget (e.g., Biochemistry cycles, Microbiology catalysts, Anatomy nerve supplies, Pharmacology drugs, Biostatistics formulas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. This is where [[effective_study_resources_and_platforms_for_fmge | concise resources]] like LRR and PYQs are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

## Exam Day Strategy

*   **Paper Variation**: Be mentally prepared for one paper to be super easy and the other super tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. Do not let a tough Paper 1 demotivate you for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.
*   **Break Time**: During the break between papers, disconnect from Paper 1 and do not discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. Focus entirely on preparing for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.
*   **Sustain Focus**: Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch without breaks or distractions to build stamina for the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.

By following these tips, especially focusing on PYQ topics, LRR videos, and managing your mental state, you can effectively prepare for the [[FMGE December 2024 exam preparation | FMGE December 2024 exam]] (or the January 2024 equivalent) and aim to cross the 150+ score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Remember, the exam is a test of mindset as much as knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

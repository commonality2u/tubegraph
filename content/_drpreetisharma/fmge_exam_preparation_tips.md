The period leading up to the FMGE exam can be stressful, with common feelings of panic and palpitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. However, maintaining a positive mindset and adhering to specific strategies can significantly aid performance.

## Before the Exam

### Last-Minute Study
*   **Wrap-up Time** It is advisable to conclude all studying by 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM on the evening before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This allows time to settle down, ease the mind, and get a good night's sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, which is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Volatile List** If you have a personal list of volatile topics, focus on reading through that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Image Scan** If you have no specific list, scan through images from subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Orthopedics, and Radiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. These subjects often feature classical spotter images that can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Late Night Study** Do not study after 8:00 PM the night before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>. Trying to cover vast subjects like Medicine late at night is not advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>. If you have some LRR (Last-minute Rapid Revision) videos, these can be viewed till 8:00 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>.

### Pre-Exam Checklist
*   **Admit Card and ID Proof** Ensure your admit card is ready, and you have a valid ID proof. Verify that the name on your ID matches the name on the admit card exactly, with no spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Photograph** As per email instructions, you do not need to paste a photograph on the admit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **Accessibility** Keep your ID in an easily accessible place to avoid misplacing it on exam morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Exam Centre** Confirm the location of your exam center well in advance; do not wait until the morning of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## On Exam Day

### Arrival at the Centre
*   **Timely Arrival** Entry for Paper 1 starts at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Arrive well before the deadline to allow time to settle down and get your heart rate back to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. For Paper 2, you will already be at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### During the Break (Between Papers)
*   **Avoid Discussion** Do not engage in discussions or chat with others between Paper 1 and Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Receiving information about questions you might have missed or answered incorrectly can negatively impact your mindset for the second paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Energy** Eat or drink something light and energy-giving to sustain you for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## During the Exam

### Managing Paper Difficulty
*   **Balanced Papers** Typically, one paper is relatively easier, and the other is more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Don't be disheartened if Paper 1 feels tough; Paper 2 might be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Present** Practice a "switch on, switch off" mode for each question. Focus solely on the current question, attempt it, and then switch off from it before moving to the next. Do not dwell on past mistakes or future questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **No Negative Marking** Since there is no negative marking, attempt every question, regardless of perceived difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Bouncer Questions** Expect 10-20 "bouncer" questions in each paper that are exceptionally difficult, obscure, or seem outside the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. These are not designed to be solved by everyone, even experts might find them challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Do not let these questions demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. Smile, mark an option (A, B, C, or D), and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Your focus should be on the other, solvable questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

### Avoiding Mistakes
*   **Silly Mistakes** The biggest mistake is to make silly errors on easy questions while focusing on difficult ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Silly mistakes often occur due to panic and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Human error is inevitable, but prevent it from being compounded by panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
*   **Reading Questions** Read every question and all options thoroughly, even if you think you know the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. This prevents missing twists or nuances in the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.
*   **Time Management** While aiming for 50 seconds per question, don't panic if a lengthy question takes longer. One-liner questions will balance out the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Lag** It's normal for the first 15 minutes of the exam to feel a bit slow as you settle in. Don't worry if you solve fewer questions initially; your pace will pick up and cover the lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>.
*   **Gut Feeling** Your first gut feeling or intuition is often correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. Do not overthink or second-guess your answers, especially in the last few minutes. Avoid changing many answers in a panic-driven re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.

## Mental Preparation and Mindset

### Cultivating Positivity
*   **Affirmations** Instead of negative thoughts, constantly affirm that the paper will be easy and you will avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   **Count Blessings** Focus on all the good things that have happened and will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. Believe that nothing bad can happen to you and that tomorrow is "your day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   **Believe in Yourself** Recognize your hard work and achievements. Your previous successes in answering questions correctly demonstrate your knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
*   **Faith and Belief** Lean on whatever gives you faith â€“ God, the universe, energy, parents' blessings, or teachers. This belief provides security and helps ward off negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.
*   **Fight for Success** Recognize that you are a fighter who has overcome many struggles. The exam is just one small challenge compared to your journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

### Managing Anxiety and Self-Doubt
*   **Normal Anxiety** It's normal to feel panicked, with an increased heart rate and palpitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Negativity** From now until the end of the exam, commit to not thinking anything negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Negative self-talk ("I've forgotten everything," "Nothing will be alright") can lead to self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Overthink** Overthinking creates problems in exams. Trust your initial analysis of a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.
*   **Confidence vs. Overconfidence** Aim to be "super confident" until 8:30 AM on exam day, believing your preparation, strategy, teachers, and sources were the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>. Once you start the exam, maintain a sane and practical approach, reading every question and option carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>.
*   **Ignore External Opinions** Do not worry about what others (outside your true supporters) will say if you don't clear the exam. Your true friends, teachers, and parents will always stand by you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. One exam does not define your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

### Goal Setting
*   **Minimum Target** The bare minimum target is to cross 150 marks. Every mark beyond that is a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. Achieving this target requires sanity and avoiding self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.
*   **Doctor Status** Recognize that you are already a doctor for all practical purposes; the exam is merely a formality for legal validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>.

This article provides essential tips and strategies for the [[FMGE exam preparation strategies | FMGE exam]], focusing on last-minute preparations, exam day logistics, and maintaining a positive mindset.

## Last-Minute Study and Mindset
The final hours before the exam are not for academic teaching but for mental preparation and ensuring readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Panic, increased heart rate, and palpitations are normal at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Evening Before the Exam
*   **Wrap-up Study:** Continue revising what you are currently studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Stop Early:** Aim to wrap up your studies by 7:00 or 7:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Relax and Sleep:** Settle yourself down, ease your mind, and get a good night's sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Last-Minute Study Content (if studying until 7:30-8 PM)
If you are still studying, consider these options:
*   **Volatile List:** Read your own personal list of volatile topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Image Scanning:** If you don't have a list, scan through images from subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Orthopedics, and Radiology, as they often feature classical spotter images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. These can be particularly helpful in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Avoid New Topics:** Do not attempt to study new or extensive subjects like Medicine hours before the exam, as they cannot be finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

## Exam Day Logistics
Ensure all necessary preparations are made to avoid stress on the day of the exam.

### Pre-Exam Checklist
*   **Admit Card:** Ensure your admit card is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Valid ID Proof:** Have a valid ID proof where the name matches the name on your admit card without any spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Photograph:** Be aware that you do not need to paste a photograph on the admit card, as per email instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** Keep your ID and admit card in a well-accessible place to prevent them from getting lost in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Exam Centre Location:** Know the exact location of your exam centre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Reaching the Exam Centre
*   **Timely Arrival:** Entry for Paper 1 starts at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Arrive well in advance to allow time for your heart rate to normalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Paper 2 Entry:** You will already be at the centre for Paper 2, so being late is not a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## During the Exam Strategy
Effective strategies during the exam can significantly impact performance.

### Between Papers
*   **Avoid Discussion:** Do not chat or message anyone between Paper 1 and Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **No Recalls:** Absolutely avoid discussing Paper 1 questions or checking recall sessions in between papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Knowing you answered something incorrectly can negatively impact your mindset for the second paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Recall sessions can be done the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Nutrition:** Focus on eating or drinking something light that provides energy for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Managing Exam Difficulty
*   **Balanced Papers:** Typically, one paper will be a little easier, and the other will be a little more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Don't be discouraged if Paper 1 feels tough; Paper 2 might be easier, allowing you to balance your score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **"Switch On/Switch Off" Mode:** For all 300 questions, focus only on the current question. Once done, "switch off" from it and move to the next. Do not dwell on previous questions or worry about future ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This "on/off" method should be applied for each question within approximately 50 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **No Negative Marking:** Since there's no negative marking, you should attempt all questions, whether the paper is easy or tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Handling "Bouncer" Questions
*   **Expect Tough Questions:** Expect 10-20 "bouncer" questions per paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These are designed to screen and might be so obscure that even experts struggle with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Do Not Dwell:** Do not focus on these difficult questions. They are not meant for everyone to solve, and even toppers don't get full marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Maintain Motivation:** These "bouncers" can lower your motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If you encounter a series of tough questions, take a deep breath, pick an option, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Core:** Concentrate on the other questions where you can avoid silly mistakes, as these are more important for your score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### General [[MCQ examination tips | MCQ Examination Tips]]
*   **Read Carefully:** Even if a question seems familiar or from a recently studied topic, spend time reading the entire question and all options (approx. 20 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Avoid the regret of missing a crucial twist in the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   **Time Management:** Some questions will be one-liners and quick, while others will be lengthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Don't worry if a lengthy question takes more than 50 seconds; the overall paper is balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **Initial Lag is Normal:** It's normal to have a slight lag in speed during the first 10-15 minutes (2-4 questions less) as you settle into the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This pace will pick up later and be covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   **First Gut Feeling:** Your first gut feeling for an answer is often correct, especially when you are not under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Do not overthink or second-guess your answers, particularly in the last minutes, as this can lead to changing correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Rule Out Options:** If you cannot directly identify the correct answer, try to rule out incorrect options to arrive at the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Silly Mistakes:** Some silly mistakes are human error and unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Don't let panic or anxiety amplify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Even highly confident students should avoid silly mistakes due to overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

## Mental Preparation and Confidence
A positive and sane mindset is crucial for success.

### Cultivating a Positive Mindset
*   **Avoid Negativity:** Do not entertain negative thoughts about the exam or your preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Manifest Positivity:** Repeatedly tell yourself, "Paper is going to be easy, I don't have to do my silly mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Count Your Blessings:** Focus on your hard work, rapid revisions, notes, LRR, images, and previous year's questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Believe in Yourself:** Have faith in your hard work and the support of your parents and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Go into the exam with the mindset that "tomorrow is my day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Combat Self-Doubt:** Reject thoughts of self-doubt, poor preparation, or bad memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Believe in your abilities, as demonstrated by your successful answers in previous sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Maintaining Sanity
*   **Passing Score:** The bare minimum target is to cross 150 marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Sanity is the most important factor in achieving this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Promise Positivity:** Promise yourself to think only positively until the end of the exam (around 4:30-5:00 PM tomorrow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Confidence vs. Overconfidence:** Be super confident until you reach the exam hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Once you sit down, maintain a sane and practical approach, reading every question and option carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

### External Perceptions
*   **Ignore Judgment:** Do not worry about what others (friends, colleagues, strangers) might say if you don't clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Focus on True Supporters:** Your teachers and parents know your hard work and will stand by you regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Broader Perspective:** Remember that there is more to life than just one exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This exam is a small challenge, a formality, compared to the challenges of saving lives as a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

This exam is just a legal process to get a final doctor's name in front of yours; it does not define your actual worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

The final 10 days before the [[FMGE January 2024 Exam Strategy | FMGE January 2024 Exam]] are crucial and can "make or break" a student's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This period requires a focused approach on specific "Dos and Don'ts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Do's

### Subject Management & Study Strategy
*   **Cover all subjects:** Do not leave any of the 19 subjects untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>. Aim to know "little by little" about every subject, enough to answer at least 50% of questions from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Address leftover subjects:** For subjects you haven't studied, watch 3-hour LRR (Last Minute Revision) sessions or crash courses from any platform, focusing on being able to solve about 50% of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on previous year topics and LRR:**
    *   For short subjects (Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, Dermatology, ENT, Ophthalmology), dedicate about two and a half days to LRR sessions and all previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.
    *   For "giant" volatile subjects (Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, PSM), focus on LRR videos and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.
    *   For clinical subjects (Medicine, Pathology, Physiology), use PYQs and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.
*   **"Scanning machine" approach:** Review everything you've already read by quickly scanning through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.
*   **Pharma/Micro strategy:** These subjects are volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>. Approach them with the mindset that you only need to manage and pass them for now, focusing on LRR and PYQs, without expecting to memorize everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize PYQs:** Complete FMG's last five years' PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>. If time permits, review three years of NEET PG recall sessions (2020, 2021, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>. If even more time, review the recent IAI CET exam paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>. If you can't solve them yourself, listen to YouTube recall sessions at 1.5x or 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on previous year *topics*:** Don't just memorize PYQ answers; understand the underlying topics. For example, if "Apoptosis" is a previous year topic, solve all related MCQs from your Q bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>.

### Time Management & Daily Routine
*   **Normalize sleep cycle:** Since the exam is during the day, adjust your sleep to be alert in the morning hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Get a minimum of 6 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.
*   **Daily schedule division:** Divide your day into four slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>:
    1.  **Study (Theory & MCQs):** This takes up most of your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. Aim for minimum 12-14 hours of productive study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. Allocate 60% of study time to MCQs and 40% to theory (from LRR PDFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.
    2.  **Images:** Dedicate one hour daily to images. Quickly scan images from subjects you studied that day before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.
    3.  **Sanity break:** Allocate 30 minutes for an outdoor activity, a light walk, or anything away from books (even social media, but be disciplined) to avoid mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.
*   **MCQ Quantity:** Aim to solve a minimum of 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>, ideally trying to cross 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a>. If you're doing 100 today, aim for 120 tomorrow, gradually increasing by 10-15 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.

### Grand Tests & MCQs
*   **Grand Test (GT) Purpose:** If giving a GT, focus on [[Time management and study techniques for FMGE | time management]] (can you finish 300 questions in the given time?) and identifying silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. Do *not* focus on the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.
*   **Reviewing MCQs:**
    *   If an MCQ is correct, do not read the explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
    *   If an MCQ is wrong, superficially read the explanation to understand if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap. If a knowledge gap, quickly read 5-10 lines on that topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Analyze GT performance:** If scores are low (e.g., 130-150), quickly analyze if mistakes are due to silly errors (practice more MCQs) or knowledge problems (re-read LRR notes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:00">[42:53:00]</a>.
*   **Practice sustained focus:** Train yourself to sit for 3 to 3.5 hours straight without breaks or distractions, mimicking exam conditions. This helps with alertness and attention span <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>.

### Mental State & Anxiety Management
*   **Positivity:** Surround yourself with positive people (parents, siblings, good friends, teachers) who give positive vibes. Avoid those who boast about scores or spread illogical rumors about exam difficulty/pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid negative thoughts:** One negative thought can lead to one incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39:00">[24:39:00]</a>. Block unnecessary thoughts about exam day logistics (alarm, reaching center, computer issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>.
*   **Combat forgetting:** It's normal to forget; no one can memorize all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>. If you forget something, quickly pick it up and revise it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>.
*   **Mindset is key:** Competitive exams are a mixture of knowledge and mindset. How you approach the exam, your mental stability in the last 10 days, and avoiding negativity are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>.
*   **"Survival mode":** Do not think about whether you enjoy studying a subject. The goal is to survive and pass the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>.
*   **Daily targets:** Focus on completing daily targets. If you finish in 8 hours instead of 12, that's an advantage, not a reason for FOMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>.

## Don'ts

*   **Don't start anything new:** Avoid studying entirely new topics in subjects you have already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   **Don't take Grand Tests if it causes panic:** If a low score will cause severe anxiety and hinder studying, it might be better not to take GTs in the last 9 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **Don't get fixated on new GT questions:** Every GT will have 20-30 "bouncer" questions you haven't seen. Don't let these dictate your preparation or confidence; your pass/fail depends on known topics and avoiding silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:08:00">[42:08:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid self-medication:** Do not take medications to stay awake or alter your routine right before the exam, as you don't know the side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>.
*   **Don't rely solely on memorized PYQs:** PYQs are no longer copied and pasted. Focus on understanding the previous year *topics* instead of just memorizing answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Pomodoro technique:** In the last days, transition from short study bursts to longer, sustained study periods (3-3.5 hours) to build stamina for the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>.
*   **Don't overthink the future:** Focus only on what you need to do in the next three hours, working in "boxes" without worrying about your condition after 5 days or on exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:18:00">[54:18:00]</a>.

## Exam Day Strategy
*   **Expect varied paper difficulty:** One paper (Paper 1 or Paper 2) will likely be tough, and the other will be easier. Don't get demotivated by a tough Paper 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[39:48:00]</a>.
*   **Disconnect during break:** After Paper 1, do not discuss it. Forget it like a bad dream and focus entirely on Paper 2 to avoid carrying over negative thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>. Your overall passing score of 150 will be a combination of both papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27:00">[41:27:00]</a>.

Students performing well (170-190+ in GTs) should stick to their current strategies, as they are clearly working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:00">[37:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:54:00">[46:54:00]</a>.

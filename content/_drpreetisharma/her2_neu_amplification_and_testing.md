Her2 Neu, also known as EGFR2 or ErbB2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, is an important marker in [[breast_cancer_pathology_and_genetics | breast cancer pathology and genetics]]. Its positivity in tumors is primarily due to gene amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Testing for Her2 Neu Amplification

Testing for Her2 Neu amplification is crucial for [[molecular_classification_in_breast_cancer | molecular classification in breast cancer]] and treatment decisions.

### Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Immunohistochemical staining for Her2 Neu typically yields a brown color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This brown coloration is caused by the Dab (diaminobenzidine) stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

IHC results are scored as follows:
*   **0 or 1+**: Indicates no Her2 amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **3+**: Signifies definite Her2 amplification, allowing for the initiation of treatment with Trastuzumab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **2+**: Represents an equivocal situation where it is unclear if Her2 is amplified or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. In such cases, further analysis is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)

FISH is the investigation of choice to test for Her2 gene amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

In FISH analysis:
*   Normal individuals typically show two red signals for Her2 (on chromosome 17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Gene amplification is indicated by the presence of multiple red signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

FISH analysis is specifically performed when immunohistochemistry results in a 2+ equivocal score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

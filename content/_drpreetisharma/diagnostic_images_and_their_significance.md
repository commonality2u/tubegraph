This article provides an overview of various diagnostic images and their significance in [[visual_pathology_markers_and_their_clinical_relevance | pathology]], as discussed in a session focused on [[pathology_image_review_for_fmg_exam | FMG exam preparation]]. It covers different types of findings, from cellular and histological features to gross organ appearances and specialized stains, all crucial for [[differential_diagnosis_in_pathology | differential diagnosis]].

## Cellular and Molecular Findings

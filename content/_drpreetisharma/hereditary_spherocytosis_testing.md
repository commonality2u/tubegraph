When examining a peripheral smear showing spherocytes, the initial instinct might be to consider hereditary spherocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, the most common cause of spherocytes is [[autoimmune_hemolytic_anemia_diagnosis | autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Hereditary spherocytosis is typically suspected when a specific clinical picture is presented, especially alongside a family history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

Hereditary spherocytosis is often considered in a patient presenting with:
*   Jaundice, indicating red blood cell breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Splenomegaly, suggesting the spleen is breaking down red blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
*   A classical family history of similar complaints, indicating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

For instance, a 16-year-old boy with jaundice and splenomegaly, whose elder brother and mother have similar complaints, would lead one to consider hereditary spherocytosis due to the clear family history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Diagnostic Testing

### Screening Test
In earlier days, **osmotic fragility testing** was performed as a screening test for hereditary spherocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Confirmatory Test
To confirm hereditary spherocytosis, the definitive test is the **EMA test** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. EMA stands for Eosin-5-maleimide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This test involves using a specific stain to detect abnormalities in red blood cell membranes characteristic of the condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Genetic Basis
The most common [[genetic_disorders_and_syndromes_related_to_pathology | genetic disorders and syndromes related to pathology]] mutation seen in hereditary spherocytosis, which is autosomal dominant, involves the mutation of the entire gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis
If hereditary spherocytosis is ruled out, other conditions like G6PD deficiency anemia might be considered, for which G6PD levels in the blood are measured using an ELISA machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

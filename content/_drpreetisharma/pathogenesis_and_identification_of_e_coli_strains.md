*E. coli* is a prototype member of the [[Enterobacteriaceae family and lactose fermentation | Enterobacteriaceae family]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Understanding its various strains and their pathogenic mechanisms is crucial in microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## E. coli Strains and Their Pathogenesis

Different strains of *E. coli* cause distinct clinical syndromes:

### Enterotoxigenic *E. coli* (ETEC)
ETEC is commonly associated with traveler's diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. It produces two main toxins:
*   **Heat-labile toxin (LT)**: Increases cyclic AMP (cAMP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This is likened to "labile in the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Heat-stable toxin (ST)**: Increases cyclic GMP (cGMP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This is likened to "stable on the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The virulence marker for ETEC is the colonization factor antigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. A history of travel is a significant indicator for ETEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

### Enteroinvasive *E. coli* (EIEC)
EIEC causes dysentery, characterized by diarrhea with blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Virulence marker**: Virulence marker antigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Diagnostic Test**: The Sereny test (also known as the Anton test) is positive for EIEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This test involves inoculating the bacteria into an animal's eye, leading to purulent keratoconjunctivitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. [[Characteristics and lab diagnosis of Clostridium species | Shigella]] also causes dysentery and can give a positive Sereny test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Enteropathogenic *E. coli* (EPEC)
EPEC is responsible for pediatric infantile diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Virulence marker**: Bundle forming pili, which are plasmid-coded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Lesions**: EPEC causes attachment and effacement (A/E) lesions on the intestinal villi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Enterohemorrhagic *E. coli* (EHEC)
EHEC is known for causing hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Toxin**: It produces verocytotoxin, also known as Shiga-like toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This toxin decreases protein synthesis by affecting the 60S ribosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Specific strain**: The O157:H7 strain is particularly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   **HUS Triad**: HUS is characterized by hemolytic anemia, renal involvement, and thrombocytopenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **Identification**: EHEC O157:H7 is "SMAC negative," meaning it does not ferment sorbitol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### Enteroaggregative *E. coli* (EAEC)
EAEC is associated with persistent diarrhea, defined as diarrhea lasting more than 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Virulence marker**: Enteroaggregative Toxin (EAST1 toxin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.
*   **Appearance**: It shows a "stacked brick appearance" on Hep-2 cell lines due to bacterial aggregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

## [[Laboratory techniques for identifying bacterial pathogens | Laboratory Identification]] of *E. coli*

*E. coli* is generally identified as a gram-negative, rod-shaped, lactose-fermenting bacterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

### Culture Media for [[Culture media preparation and identification | Lactose Fermentation]]

Several culture media are used to identify lactose-fermenting bacteria, including *E. coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

*   **MacConkey Agar**:
    *   **Composition**: Peptone, agar, lactose, neutral red (indicator), and bile salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
    *   **Category**: It is a differential medium (for lactose fermentation), an indicator medium (due to neutral red), and a selective medium (due to bile salts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
    *   **Color**: Lactose fermentation on MacConkey agar produces a pink color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. *E. coli* typically shows a pink color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>, sometimes with a shiny or mucoid appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

*   **CLED (Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient) Agar**:
    *   **Purpose**: Also used for lactose fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
    *   **Indicator**: Bromothymol blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
    *   **Color**: Lactose fermenters turn yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
    *   **Advantage**: CLED is considered better than MacConkey because it is less inhibitory, allowing the growth of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

*   **Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) Agar**:
    *   **Purpose**: Used for lactose fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.
    *   **Appearance**: Lactose fermenting colonies like *E. coli* show a greenish metallic sheen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

*   **Sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) Agar**:
    *   **Purpose**: Used to test for sorbitol fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
    *   **Specific use**: Crucial for distinguishing EHEC O157:H7, as it is SMAC negative (does not ferment sorbitol), unlike other *E. coli* strains which typically ferment sorbitol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

### Summary of Fermentation Colors
Most fermentations on agar (like mannitol, sucrose) typically result in a yellow color, with the notable exception of MacConkey agar, which produces a pink color for lactose fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.

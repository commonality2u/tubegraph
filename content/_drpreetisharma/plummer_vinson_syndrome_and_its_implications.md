Plummer-Vinson Syndrome is a medical condition primarily characterized by difficulty swallowing and iron deficiency anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Synonyms
The condition is also known by other names, including:
*   Paterson-Kelly Syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
*   Brown-Patterson-Kelly Syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
*   Sideropenic Dysphagia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>

## Clinical Features
The classic triad of Plummer-Vinson Syndrome includes:

*   [[insights_into_git_disorders_like_achalasia_cardia | Dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
*   Esophageal webs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>

Additional features may include glossitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Pathophysiology
The [[insights_into_git_disorders_like_achalasia_cardia | dysphagia]] in Plummer-Vinson Syndrome is caused by esophageal webs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. These webs are constrictions or folds of tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> that do not typically show evidence of inflammation or cancer upon mucosal biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Malignant Transformation
Patients with Plummer-Vinson Syndrome are at an increased risk of developing [[explanation_of_medical_conditions_and_classifications | squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

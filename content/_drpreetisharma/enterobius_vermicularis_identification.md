This article discusses the identification of *Enterobius vermicularis*, also known as pinworm, through histopathological images and microbiology techniques, as well as an associated clinical case differentiating acute appendicitis from peri-appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The discussion is part of a series covering an [[Pathology Image Identification | image of the day]] and an [[Parasitology quiz and general pathology quizzes | MCQ of the day]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Histopathological Identification of *Enterobius vermicularis*

The specific finding in the provided image is *Enterobius vermicularis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The organ involved in this case is the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Key Identification Features of the Worm
When identifying *Enterobius vermicularis* in histopathology, the crucial feature to look for is the presence of two lateral cuticular alae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. These are pointed, projecting structures seen on the sides of the worm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The presence of these two lateral cuticular alae is the striking point for identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Clinical Context
*Enterobius vermicularis* in the appendix is often an incidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. While occasionally it can be responsible for causing appendicitis or acute appendicitis, this is not very common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The classical symptom associated with *Enterobius* infection is pruritus or perianal itching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Microbiological Identification of *Enterobius vermicularis* Eggs

### Collection Technique
For diagnosing *Enterobius* eggs, the standard technique is the cellulose tape method or tape preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Egg Characteristics
The eggs of *Enterobius vermicularis* are classically described as plano-convex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Inside these eggs, a tadpole larva can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Appearance Under Different Stains
The plano-convex eggs with the tadpole larva are visible under various staining methodologies:
*   **Ultraviolet (UV) Light:** The eggs show a distinct appearance under UV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Pap Stain:** When stained with a Pap stain, the plano-convex shape and the tadpole larva are clearly discernible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Differentiating Acute Appendicitis and Peri-appendicitis

The discussion also includes an [[Parasitology quiz and general pathology quizzes | MCQ]] scenario involving a 17-year-old girl with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, an enlarged appendix, and histological features of a dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate in the serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Criteria for Acute Appendicitis
For a pathological diagnosis of acute appendicitis, neutrophils (cells of acute inflammation) must be seen specifically in the *muscularis propria* (muscle layer) of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. If the inflammation is not in the muscularis propria, it is not considered acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Understanding Peri-appendicitis
Inflammation seen in the *serosa* layer of the appendix indicates *peri-appendicitis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This means the inflammation is surrounding the appendix, rather than originating within the appendix itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. It suggests that inflammation from a surrounding organ has extended onto the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Common Cause of Peri-appendicitis in Females
In females, one very common cause of peri-appendicitis is salpingitis, which is inflammation of the fallopian tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The inflammation from salpingitis can extend to the serosa of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Therefore, in the given MCQ scenario where inflammation was explicitly noted in the serosa, the correct diagnosis is acute salpingitis, as it represents peri-appendicitis rather than acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Perforation of the appendix would also not show a proper muscle layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

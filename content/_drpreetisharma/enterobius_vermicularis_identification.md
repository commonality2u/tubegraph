*Enterobius vermicularis*, commonly known as the [[histology_and_staining_techniques_for_pinworm_diagnosis | pinworm]], is a parasite often discussed in [[Parasitology quizzes and case studies | case studies]] involving an image of the day and multiple-choice questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is frequently associated with the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Histopathological Identification

When examining tissue samples, particularly from the appendix lumen, the key to identifying *Enterobius vermicularis* is the presence of two lateral cuticular alae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. These are pointed projections visible on the organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The presence of these alae is a striking and definitive point for identifying the worm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Histological images may show the appendix's lining, goblet cells, and dense lymphoid aggregates, which are characteristic of normal appendix [[histology_and_staining_techniques_for_pinworm_diagnosis | histology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The *Enterobius vermicularis* worm can be seen within the lumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Microbiological Identification

The eggs of *Enterobius vermicularis* are classically described as plano-convex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Inside these eggs, a tadpole larva can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

The primary technique for collecting *Enterobius* eggs from a patient is the cellulose tape method or tape preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Staining Methodologies for Eggs

The appearance of *Enterobius* eggs can vary under different [[histology_and_staining_techniques_for_pinworm_diagnosis | staining methodologies]]:
*   **Ultraviolet Light** When viewed under ultraviolet light, the plano-convex egg with the tadpole larva has a distinct appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Pap Stain** The same plano-convex egg and tadpole larva are discernible when stained with a Pap stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation and Significance

*Enterobius vermicularis* is most commonly an incidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. While rare, it can occasionally be responsible for causing appendicitis or acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The classical symptom associated with *Enterobius* infection is perianal itching, or pruritus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Differentiating Appendicitis

In cases of suspected appendicitis, histological examination of the appendix specimen is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. For a diagnosis of acute appendicitis, neutrophils (cells of acute inflammation) must be seen in the muscularis propria (muscle layer) of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

If inflammation is seen only in the serosa (outer layer) of the appendix, it indicates peri-appendicitis, meaning the inflammation is surrounding the appendix rather than originating within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This can occur when inflammation from a surrounding organ, such as salpingitis (fallopian tube inflammation) in females, extends onto the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. A perforated appendix would not show a proper muscle layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

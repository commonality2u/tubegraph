DiGeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder commonly associated with the "Catch-22" mnemonic, referring to its key features and genetic cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

A patient with DiGeorge syndrome, such as a three-month-old male infant, may present with severe muscle spasms and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Other signs include recurrent infections and feeding difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. On examination, the face might appear dysmorphic, and a cleft palate may be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. A chest x-ray can reveal an absent thymic shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

The seizures in these patients are caused by hypocalcemia, a decrease in calcium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## Genetics and Etiology

DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by a deletion on chromosome 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Specifically, it involves the deletion 22q11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. This specific deletion affects the TBX1 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

It is important to distinguish this from deletion 11q22, which affects chromosome 11 and is associated with [[ataxia_telangiectasia_and_fanconi_anemia_and_bloom_syndrome | Ataxia Telangiectasia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## Pathophysiology

The deletion on chromosome 22 leads to embryological problems affecting two key organs: the thymus and the parathyroid glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. These organs are not developed properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

*   **Thymus:** An underdeveloped thymus results in impaired development of T-cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. This leads to decreased immunity and recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. The absence of the thymus can also be seen as an absent thymic shadow on a chest X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   **Parathyroid Gland:** The absence or underdevelopment of the parathyroid glands leads to a decrease in parathyroid hormone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. This, in turn, causes hypocalcemia, which is responsible for seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

## Catch-22 Mnemonic

The mnemonic "Catch-22" helps recall the main features of DiGeorge syndrome:
*   **C**ardiac abnormalities: Common cardiac defects include Tetralogy of Fallot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   **A**bnormal facies: Dysmorphic facial features are characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **T**hymic hypoplasia/aplasia: Leading to T-cell deficiency and recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   **C**left palate: This is a commonly observed feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   **H**ypocalcemia: Caused by parathyroid aplasia, leading to seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   **22:** Refers to the deletion on chromosome 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Diagnosis

The deletion of chromosome 22q11 can be tested using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

## Related Associations

The TBX1 gene, which is affected in DiGeorge syndrome, has also been associated with schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

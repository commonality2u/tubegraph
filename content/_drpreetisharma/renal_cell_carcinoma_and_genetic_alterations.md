Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) refers to a group of kidney cancers, with different types associated with distinct histological features and genetic alterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Types of Renal Cell Carcinoma

### Clear Cell RCC (CCC)
*   **Most Common** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   **Appearance**: Characterized by empty clear cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Histology shows all white, empty, clear cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alteration**: Deletion of chromosome 3p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndrome**: [[Kidney and brain pathology | Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Papillary RCC
*   **Histology**: Tall cells arranged in papillae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Associated Bodies**: Typically shows psammoma bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alterations**:
    *   Loss of Y chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   Trisomy 7 and Trisomy 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Associated Conditions**:
    *   Seen in patients with a history of dialysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
    *   Fumarate hydratase (FH) gene mutation can result in papillary RCC, often associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis (which presents with multiple fibroids/leiomyomas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Chromophobe RCC
*   **Genetic Alterations**: Characterized by multiple chromosomal losses, as it "runs away from chromosomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Examples include loss of chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 10, 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndrome**: Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This syndrome is also associated with fibrofolliculomas (skin adnexal tumor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Appearance**: Shows "plant cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. These cells have a proper outline, a dark "resinoid" nucleus, and a peri-nuclear halo (white area around the nucleus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

In a patient's report, it would be indicated by "HbAS" (adult hemoglobin A and sickle hemoglobin S) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Pediatric RCC

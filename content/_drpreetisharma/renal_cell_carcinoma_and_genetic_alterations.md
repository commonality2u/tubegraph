Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is a type of kidney cancer that presents with symptoms such as right flank pain and hematuria (blood in urine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. A flank mass may also be palpable, and a CCT scan often reveals a tumor mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Nephrectomy is performed for diagnosis and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Types of Renal Cell Carcinoma

### Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (CCC RCC)
Clear Cell RCC is the most common type of renal cell carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

*   **Histology**: Characterized by the presence of empty clear cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Histology images show an abundance of white, empty-looking cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alteration**: A deletion on chromosome 3p is typically observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndrome**: It is commonly associated with [[genetic_disorders_and_syndromes_related_to_pathology | Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, which involves a mutation in the VHL gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

### Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma
*   **Histology**: Histology reveals tall cells arranged in papillary structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Papillary tumors often contain [[cardiac_tumors_and_associated_syndromes | psammoma bodies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alterations**: Common genetic alterations include Trisomy 7 and 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Loss of the Y chromosome is also associated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Associated Conditions**:
    *   Often seen in patients on dialysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
    *   Mutations in the Fumarate Hydratase (FH) gene can lead to [[genetic_disorders_and_syndromes_related_to_pathology | Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Carcinoma (HLRCC)]], which presents with numerous leiomyomas along with papillary RCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

### Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma
*   **Histology**: Cells may resemble plant cells, characterized by a proper outline, a dark or "raisinoid" nucleus, and a peri-nuclear halo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.
*   **Special Stain**: It stains blue with Hale's Colloidal Iron stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alterations**: Characterized by multiple chromosomal losses (e.g., chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 10, 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndrome**: It is associated with [[genetic_disorders_and_syndromes_related_to_pathology | Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome]], which also features skin adnexal tumors like fibrofolliculoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.

### Collecting Duct (Bellini Duct) Renal Cell Carcinoma
This type of RCC has the worst prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>. It arises from the collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.

### Medullary Renal Cell Carcinoma
*   **Associated Condition**: Strongly associated with [[genetic_disorders_and_syndromes_related_to_pathology | sickle cell trait]], not sickle cell anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.

### Pediatric Renal Cell Carcinoma
*   **Genetic Alteration**: Associated with TFE3 gene mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, located on chromosome X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. While common in children, it can also occur in older patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. It is distinct from Wilms tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>.

## Other Renal Tumors and Associated Conditions

### Angiomyolipoma (AML)
*   **Composition**: Composed of three elements: angio (blood vessels), myo (muscle), and lipo (fat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndrome**: Associated with [[genetic_disorders_and_syndromes_related_to_pathology | tuberous sclerosis]] (TSC1 and TSC2 genes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>. Tuberous sclerosis also causes [[cardiac_tumors_and_associated_syndromes | cardiac rhabdomyoma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

### Renal Oncocytoma
*   **Nature**: A benign renal tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Composed of oncocytes, which are cells rich in mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.
*   **Gross Appearance**: Characteristically appears mahogany brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>.
*   **Key Feature**: Often shows a central stellate scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>.

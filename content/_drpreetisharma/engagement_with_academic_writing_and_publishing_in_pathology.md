Engagement with academic writing and publishing is an important aspect of a pathologist's career, particularly during and after [[pathology_residency_challenges_and_personal_experiences | residency]]. This includes writing original articles, case reports, and review articles.

## Types of Academic Writing

During [[pathology_residency_challenges_and_personal_experiences | residency]] and senior residency, pathologists can engage in various forms of academic writing:

*   **Original Articles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>: These require significant research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The effort involved in writing original articles is cumulative, often spanning 6 years across postgraduate (PG) and senior residency (S.R.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. It is not an overnight endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. While challenging to write many during PG due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, senior residency often provides more time for such endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Case Reports** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>: Writing case reports is generally faster than original articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. A case report does not necessarily need to be an "out of the world" or "one in a million" case; a series of four to five cases can also be compiled to offer a new perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Guidance is available for the writing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Reviews** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>: Review articles, done when time permits, are akin to writing a mini-book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The speaker completed a review on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis due to a personal interest in genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Personal Academic Development

The speaker has a strong interest in genetics, which led to pursuing an online genetics course lasting approximately four to five months, describing it as very rigorous but highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This course, completed recently in December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, focused on genomics and precision oncology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Academic Engagement for Residents

For residents, especially first-year residents, engaging with academics is crucial even if the department doesn't have a strong academic program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

*   **Self-Study** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>: Residents should take responsibility for their own academics. This includes consistently reading *Robins* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>, which is essential for any academic [[discussion_on_pathology_for_upcoming_exams | discussion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.
*   **Reading Recent Articles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>: A key part of academics is participation in Journal Clubs. Residents should aim to read at least one article per week to stay updated on new immunohistochemical markers, genetic analyses, and genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. Even in departments with academic activities, residents often need to study on their own due to exhaustion from grossing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.

### Post-Residency Continued Learning

After completing MD, pathologists enter a "wish zone" where they can decide their future academic and professional path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. This could involve taking a break from studies to work, or pursuing additional certificate courses to upscale oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. For example, the speaker, realizing a weaker exposure to hepatobiliary pathology during residency, later pursued a one-year course on liver biopsies and hepatopathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. The increasing availability of online courses, Zoom seminars, and webinars makes continued learning more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

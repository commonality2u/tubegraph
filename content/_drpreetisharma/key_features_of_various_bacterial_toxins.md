Bacterial toxins are crucial [[virulence_factors_of_bacillus_anthracis | virulence factors]] that contribute to the [[pathology_and_presentation_of_various_bacterial_infections | pathology and presentation of various bacterial infections]]. This article outlines key toxins from gram-negative bacilli, focusing on their mechanisms of action, associated diseases, and diagnostic features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Enterobacteriaceae Family Toxins

The *Enterobacteriaceae* family, including *E. coli* and *Klebsiella*, are typically gram-negative, rod-shaped, and lactose-fermenting bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. *E. coli* is considered the prototype of this family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### *E. coli* Toxins

*E. coli* produces several key toxins:
*   **Labile Toxin (LT)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** Increases cyclic AMP (cAMP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. (Mnemonic: "Labile in the air" implies increasing cAMP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   **Associated with:** Enterotoxigenic *E. coli* (ETEC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
    *   **Disease:** Traveler's diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
    *   **Virulence Marker:** Colonization Factor Antigen (CFA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Stable Toxin (ST)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** Increases cyclic GMP (cGMP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. (Mnemonic: "Stable on the ground" implies increasing cGMP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   **Associated with:** Enterotoxigenic *E. coli* (ETEC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
    *   **Disease:** Traveler's diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Verocytotoxin (VT) / Shiga-like Toxin (SLT)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** Decreases protein synthesis by affecting the 60S ribosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
    *   **Associated with:** Enterohemorrhagic *E. coli* (EHEC), specifically the O157:H7 strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
    *   **Disease:** Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), characterized by a triad of hemolytic anemia, renal involvement, and thrombocytopenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
    *   **Distinguishing Feature:** EHEC O157:H7 is "SMAC negative," meaning it does not ferment sorbitol, unlike most other *E. coli* strains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

    *   Note: *Clostridium difficile* is a gram-positive organism, which distinguishes it from the gram-negative bacilli discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Other Relevant Toxins & Features

*   **Lactose Fermentation:**
    *   **MacConkey Agar:** Contains peptone, agar, lactose, neutral red (indicator), and bile salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Lactose fermentation yields a pink color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. It is a differential, indicator, and selective medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
    *   **CLED (Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient) Agar:** Contains lactose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. Lactose fermentation yields a yellow color with bromothymol blue as an indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. CLED is preferred over MacConkey because it is "less inhibitory," allowing both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.
    *   **Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) Agar:** Also used for lactose fermentation. Positive result shows a greenish metallic sheen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   **Mucoid Colonies:** Associated with capsulated organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. For example, *Klebsiella* forms mucoid colonies on MacConkey agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, and is a capsulated organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
*   **String Test:**
    *   **Lab:**
        *   For *Klebsiella* (due to mucoid colonies/capsule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
        *   For *Vibrio cholerae* (associated with rice water stools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
    *   **Patient:** For *Giardia lamblia* (parasitology) where the patient swallows a string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

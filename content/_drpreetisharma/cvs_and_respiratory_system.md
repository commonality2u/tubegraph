## Introduction
This article provides an overview of various pathologies related to the Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems, drawing insights from clinical discussions and case studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Cardiovascular System (CVS)

### Cardiac Tumors
The most likely cardiac tumor in a patient with intellectual disability and seizures is a Rhabdomyoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This condition is strongly associated with [[Tuberous Sclerosis and its implications | Tuberous Sclerosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

#### [[Tuberous Sclerosis and its implications | Tuberous Sclerosis]]
[[Tuberous Sclerosis and its implications | Tuberous Sclerosis]] is linked to mutations in two genes:
*   **TSC1**: Located on chromosome 9, encoding the protein Hamartin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **TSC2**: Located on chromosome 16, encoding the protein Tuberin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

A mnemonic for [[Tuberous Sclerosis and its implications | Tuberous Sclerosis]] findings is "ASH LEAF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:
*   **A**sh Leaf Spot: Hypopigmented skin lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **S**haagreen Patch: Thick, leathery skin appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **H**eart: Rhabdomyoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **L**ungs: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a tumor involving lymphatic channels, blood vessels, and smooth muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **E**pilepsy (Brain): Cortical tubers and Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA), explaining intellectual disability and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **A**ngiomyolipoma (Kidney): AML, a tumor of blood vessels, fat, and smooth muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **F**ace: Angiofibroma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

All tumors associated with [[Tuberous Sclerosis and its implications | Tuberous Sclerosis]] (Rhabdomyoma, LAM, AML) are considered Hamartomatous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

    *   Unlike hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, DCM does not show myocardial disarray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

*   **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**:
    *   Associated with myosin heavy chain mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
    *   Grossly, it presents as a "banana-shaped heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

    *   Genetic defect in the Plakoglobin gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
    *   Grossly, the right ventricle shows fatty replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

### Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Complications
*   MI is characterized by coagulative necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Post-MI Complications**:
    *   **Rupture (ventricular, septal, papillary muscle)**: Most likely to occur 3-7 days post-MI, when the body is not yet in full scar/repair mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
    *   **Dressler's Syndrome (Autoimmune Pericarditis)**: A late complication, typically appearing 19-21 days (around 3 weeks) post-MI, as it involves antibody formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

*   **TTC Staining (Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride)**:
    *   Stains normal, viable heart tissue brick red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This is because it reacts with LDH1 (Lactate Dehydrogenase Isoenzyme 1), which is abundant in normal heart tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.
    *   Infarcted (dead) tissue appears pale, as LDH1 is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.
    *   The stain is useful for detecting MI within the first 4 hours, before gross changes in heart color become visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

*   **Reperfusion Injury**:
    *   Occurs when blood flow is restored to ischemic tissue (e.g., after angioplasty for MI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.
    *   Mediated by free radicals, inflammatory cells, and calcium influx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
    *   Leads to "contraction band necrosis" due to sudden calcium overload, causing hypercontraction of muscle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
    *   Granulation tissue is *not* seen in reperfusion injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

### Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)
*   Often asymptomatic and discovered as an incidental finding, typically presenting with a mid-systolic click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   Also known as "Floppy Valve Syndrome" or "Barlow Syndrome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
*   Histologically, it shows myxomatous degeneration, where the valve tissue becomes jelly-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

*   Presents with symptoms like chest discomfort, night sweats, fever, and cough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.
*   Cervical lymphadenopathy is a common finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.

**Corynebacterium diphtheriae** is a Gram-positive bacillus, part of a group of bacteria that are typically Gram-negative, but stand out as exceptions [04:57:00]. It is known for causing diphtheria, a severe disease often associated with a pseudomembrane in the throat and distinct morphological and cultural characteristics [08:50:00].

## Clinical Presentation
Diphtheria typically presents with a sore throat, low-grade fever, and a thick membrane covering the tonsils and pharynx [08:50:00]. A classical sign is a "bull's neck," caused by severe lymphadenopathy [11:21:00]. The pseudomembrane is a key diagnostic feature [10:27:00].

When taking a sample for diagnosis, it's important to collect it from *under* the pseudomembrane, as the membrane itself consists of dead cells [10:59:00].

A common and severe complication of diphtheria is myocarditis, which can present as a "tiger and tabby cat appearance" in the heart due to fat deposition [34:29:00]. Other conditions showing fat deposition in the heart include cell injury and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [34:54:00].

## Gram Staining and Morphology
*C. diphtheriae* are Gram-positive bacilli, meaning they appear purple and elongated on Gram stain [25:54:00]. They exhibit a characteristic "Chinese letter" or "cuneiform" arrangement [26:03:00].

A notable feature is the presence of "bulbous ends" or "big big granules" at the poles of the bacteria [26:39:00]. These are known by several names:
*   Volutin granules [26:49:00]
*   Babes-Ernst granules [26:54:00]
*   Bipolar granules [26:59:00]
*   Metachromatic granules [27:10:00]

### Staining for Granules
These granules can be visualized using **Albert stain** [27:17:00]. The chemicals used in Albert stain are **toluidine blue**, **iodine**, and **malachite green** [27:40:00]. On Albert stain, the bacteria itself appears green, while the Volutin granules appear purple [28:09:00]. This phenomenon, where a stain (like toluidine blue) looks one color in the bottle but appears a different color under the microscope, is called **metachromasia** [28:24:00]. Toluidine blue is also used as a special stain for mast cells and basophils [29:49:00].

The granules contain polymetaphosphate, serving as an energy reserve for the bacteria [30:35:00].

## Culture Media
Two main types of culture media are used for *C. diphtheriae*:
1.  **Enriched Culture Media**:
    *   **Loeffler's serum slope**: This medium allows for early diagnosis as *C. diphtheriae* grows quickly, taking approximately 6 to 8 hours [31:17:00]. It contains eggs, mineral salt solution, and malachite green [32:17:00].

2.  **Selective Culture Media**:
    *   **Potassium tellurite agar**: This medium yields black colonies due to the reduction of tellurite by the bacteria [31:41:00]. However, growth on this medium takes longer, about 48 hours [32:02:00].
    *   **Tinsdale agar**: Another selective medium for *C. diphtheriae* [32:38:00].

For early diagnosis, Loeffler's serum slope is preferred, while for the best culture media, potassium tellurite agar is recommended [32:18:00].

## Diagnostic Tests
Two primary tests are performed to assess *C. diphtheriae*:

1.  **Elek Gel Precipitation Test**:
    *   **Purpose**: To determine the **toxinogenicity** of the bacteria [21:53:00]. This test confirms if the isolated bacteria produces toxins [22:02:00].
    *   **Procedure**: A strip impregnated with antitoxin is placed on a culture medium. *C. diphtheriae* isolates are streaked perpendicularly to the strip. If the bacteria produces toxin, a reaction occurs between the toxin and antitoxin, forming visible precipitant lines [22:06:00].
    *   **Interpretation**: Presence of precipitant lines indicates the bacteria is toxigenic; absence means it is non-toxigenic [23:06:00].

2.  **Schick Test**:
    *   **Purpose**: To assess the **susceptibility** of a patient to diphtheria [23:52:00].
    *   **Mechanism**: It is an intradermal test, similar to a tuberculin test (Mantoux test), which involves injecting antigen/toxin into the skin [23:46:00]. The Schick test is a Type III hypersensitivity reaction [24:21:00].
    *   **Interpretation**:
        *   **Positive Schick test**: Redness at the injection site indicates the patient is susceptible to diphtheria infection (lacks protective antitoxin) [25:07:00].
        *   **Negative Schick test**: No reaction indicates the patient is immune to diphtheria (has protective antitoxin) [25:18:00].

## Treatment
Treatment for diphtheria involves a multi-pronged approach:
*   **Droplet Precautions**: Essential for all patients due to droplet spread [39:14:00].
*   **Antibiotics**: Penicillin and erythromycin are commonly used [39:19:00]. Antibiotics are given to all patients regardless of disease type [39:21:00].
*   **Diphtheria Antitoxin (DAT)**: The dosage varies based on the severity and duration of the disease.
    *   For pharyngeal disease: 20,000 to 40,000 units [39:47:00].
    *   For nasopharyngeal disease: 40,000 to 60,000 units [39:54:00].
    *   For extensive disease: 80,000 to 120,000 units (crossing 1 lakh units) [40:17:00].
    *   The typical range given is 20,000 to 120,000 International Units (IU) [40:30:00].
    *   **Administration**: Usually given intramuscularly (IM) [42:37:00]. However, if there is neck disease (bull's neck) or if the disease has been present for more than three days, half the dose is given intramuscularly and half intravenously (IV) [40:43:00]. For severe infections, the dose is divided between IM and IV routes (e.g., 50,000 units IM and 50,000 units IV for a 1 lakh unit dose) [42:51:00].

## Virulence Factors
The potent toxin produced by *C. diphtheriae* is a key virulence factor [09:51:00]. This toxin works by decreasing protein synthesis [16:36:00]. It achieves this by causing ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF2) [17:46:00]. Other toxins that decrease protein synthesis include Pseudomonas toxin, Shiga toxin, and Shiga-like toxin (produced by *E. coli*) [17:10:00].

*   **[[pathogen_identification_and_characteristics | Corynebacterium ulcerans]]**: Associated with respiratory and lung symptoms [13:12:00].
*   **[[pathogen_identification_and_characteristics | Corynebacterium jeikeium]]**: Known for causing endocarditis [13:32:00].
*   Some *Corynebacterium* species are lipophilic, such as *Corynebacterium urealyticum* and *Corynebacterium jeikeium* [13:58:00].

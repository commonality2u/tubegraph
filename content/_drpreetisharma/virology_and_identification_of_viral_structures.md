Virology is an essential field in [[Pathology and Microbiology | pathology and microbiology]] that involves the study and identification of viruses and their structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Microscopy for Virus Identification

To visualize viruses, which are extremely small, an [[Diagnosis using electron microscopy | electron microscope]] is typically required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:40">[01:59:40]</a>. This type of microscope operates under vacuum, appearing "closed from everywhere like a space shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:41">[01:43:41]</a>. The fixative used for electron microscopy is typically 2 to 2.5% glutaraldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>.

In contrast, [[Light and electron microscopy in microbiology | light microscopes]] use a 10% neutral buffered formalin fixative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:49">[01:43:49]</a>.

## Specific Viral Structures and Associated Diseases

Several viruses can be identified by their distinctive shapes and characteristics under an electron microscope:

### Bullet-Shaped Virus
The **rabies virus** is characterized by its bullet shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:44">[01:59:44]</a>. Rabies is 100% fatal and is associated with the presence of Negri bodies, which are stained using the Seller's stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:48">[01:59:48]</a>.

### Crown-Shaped Virus
The **coronavirus** is recognized by its crown-like appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

### Box-Shaped with Dumbbell DNA
**Poxviruses** are identified by their box shape containing dumbbell-shaped DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:07">[02:00:07]</a>.

### Star-Shaped Virus
A **star-shaped** appearance is characteristic of the **astrovirus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:25">[02:00:25]</a>.

### Rotating Wheel Virus
The **rotavirus** presents as a rotating wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:28">[02:00:28]</a>. This virus is a common cause of diarrhea, primarily due to its virulence marker, NS4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:33">[02:00:33]</a>.

### Bowl of Spaghetti Filaments
The **Ebola virus** is described as looking like a "bowl of spaghetti filaments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:45">[02:00:45]</a>. Ebola virus can be transmitted from bats and wild animals to humans, and then human-to-human transmission can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:53">[02:07:53]</a>. The Zaire Ebola virus is considered the most dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:37">[02:08:37]</a>.

### Spaceship with Aliens
The **adenovirus** is likened to a "spaceship with aliens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. Serotypes 40 and 41 of adenovirus cause infantile diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:11">[02:01:11]</a>.

## Other Viruses and Associated Features

### Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever or "kissing disease," is caused by the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:38">[02:01:38]</a>. The characteristic **Downey cell**, a CD8 T-lymphocyte, appears as a "ballerina skirt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:28">[02:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:24">[02:02:24]</a>. EBV primarily enters B cells via the CD21/CR2 receptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a monospot test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:35">[02:02:35]</a>.

### Parvovirus B19
**Parvovirus B19** causes "slapped cheek appearance" on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:21">[02:03:21]</a>. It is a single-stranded DNA virus and the smallest DNA virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:07">[02:04:07]</a>. In [[Pathology and Microbiology | pathology]], Parvovirus can cause an aplastic crisis, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions like hereditary spherocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:17">[02:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:48">[02:04:48]</a>.

### Molluscum Contagiosum
**Molluscum contagiosum** is associated with **Henderson-Paterson bodies** (also called Downie bodies) which are stained using Flock's stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:53">[02:05:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>.

### Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
**Human Papillomavirus (HPV)** infection of the cervix shows a "dark nucleus and a peri-nuclear halo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:27">[02:06:27]</a>. The characteristic cells are known as **koilocytes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:36]</a>.
*   The L1 capsule is used for vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:44">[02:06:44]</a>.
*   E4 and E5 proteins are responsible for koilocyte formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:50">[02:06:50]</a>.
*   E6 and E7 proteins cause cancer; E6 switches off p53, and E7 switches off the RB gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:53">[02:06:53]</a>.

### Nipah Virus
The **Nipah virus** is transmitted by **fruit bats** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:24">[02:07:24]</a>. It causes encephalitis with high mortality rates (around 70%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:38">[02:07:38]</a>. Human-to-human transmission can occur through secretions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:22">[02:08:22]</a>.

The molecular classification of [[breast_pathology_and_diagnosis | breast cancer]] categorizes tumors based on their genetic profiles. While [[breast_pathology_and_diagnosis | immunohistochemistry]] (IHC) markers like Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), and [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] are commonly used in clinical practice, the fundamental basis for this classification is [[breast_pathology_and_diagnosis | gene profiling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>. IHC acts as a surrogate for [[breast_pathology_and_diagnosis | gene profiling]] due to technical and affordability constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.

## Classification Categories

### Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
*   **Definition:** These tumors are negative for Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), and [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.
*   **Associated Tumors:**
    *   Medullary carcinoma [[breast_pathology_and_diagnosis | breast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>
    *   Metaplastic carcinoma [[breast_pathology_and_diagnosis | breast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>

### [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]]-rich
*   **Definition:** These tumors are positive for [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] and negative for ER and PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.
*   **Associated Tumors:** Apocrine carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

### Luminal A
*   **Definition:** These tumors are positive for ER and PR, and negative for [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.
*   **Proliferation Index (Ki67):** Less than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.
*   **Associated Tumors (often considered "dustbin" for remaining types):**
    *   Tubular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>
    *   Mucinous carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>
    *   Invasive lobular carcinoma (low grade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>

### Luminal B
*   **Definition:** These tumors are positive for ER and PR, and negative for [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. However, they can sometimes be "triple positive" (ER/PR/[[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] positive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.
*   **Proliferation Index (Ki67):** More than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.
*   **Associated Tumors:** Invasive lobular carcinoma (high grade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.

## Ki67 Proliferation Index
Ki67 (also known as MIB-1) is a proliferation marker used to differentiate between Luminal A and Luminal B breast cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. For instance, in Burkitt's Lymphoma, Ki67 is almost 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

## [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] Amplification and Testing
[[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] amplification is a [[genetic_alterations_in_thyroid_cancer | gene amplification]] that can be detected via [[breast_pathology_and_diagnosis | immunohistochemistry]] (IHC) and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

### IHC Scoring for [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]]
*   **0 and 1+:** Negative, low brown color, indicates [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] is not amplified. Trastuzumab (targeted therapy) is not given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.
*   **3+:** Positive, strong brown color, indicates [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] is amplified. Trastuzumab is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
*   **2+:** Equivocal, requires further investigation with FISH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.

### FISH Testing for [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]]
FISH is used when IHC results are equivocal (2+). It measures the ratio of [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] gene copies to chromosome 17 copies (where [[breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_her2_testing | HER2]] is located) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
*   **Amplified:** A ratio of more than 2.2 indicates amplification, and targeted therapy (e.g., Trastuzumab) is administered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
*   **Not amplified:** A ratio of less than 2.2 indicates no amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

## Male Breast Cancer
Male [[breast_pathology_and_diagnosis | breast cancer]] is much less common than in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.
*   **Most Common Mutation:** BRCA2 mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.
*   **Most Common Morphological Type:** Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>.
*   **Equal Incidence in Genders:** Myofibroblastoma (MF tumor) shows equal incidence in males and females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.

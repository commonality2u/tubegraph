This article discusses the [[identification_and_characteristics_of_brain_tumors | characteristics of brain tumors]], focusing on their appearance under microscopy and key [[histology_and_its_correlation_with_specific_renal_tumors | histological]] features.

## Microscopic Features
A very simple [[identification_and_characteristics_of_brain_tumors | brain tumor]] can be appreciated through visual representation, such as a slide instrument or pictorial representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Key features often include:
*   Cells with white space around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   The presence of red-colored material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Blue-colored components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Pink-colored patches with a specific arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, including pink-colored amorphous material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Classical Histological Appearance
Under the microscope, some brain tumors exhibit classic features such as:
*   **Chickenwire blood vessels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   A **fried egg appearance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These are considered very important [[key_pathology_images_and_their_significance | diagnostic features]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

These microscopic findings are critical for the [[identification_and_characteristics_of_brain_tumors | diagnosis of brain tumors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

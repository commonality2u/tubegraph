From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

This session provides a targeted review of key pathology images for the upcoming FMG exam, aiming to help students revise important concepts and alleviate pre-exam stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The session, though labeled "Top 50 Images," covers significantly more, including topics from both pathology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## General Exam Advice and Strategy
*   **Focus on Revision**: At this stage, focus on revision rather than new in-depth study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Utilize Previous Sessions**: Revisit the LRR (Last Revision) sessions from November and December for pathology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This session itself does not require further revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Manage Nerves**: Keeping nerves calm is crucial for exam survival, even more so than just mugging up previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Take deep breaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Passive Learning**: If self-study is difficult due to stress, passive learning (e.g., listening to lectures) is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Session Etiquette**: Avoid miscellaneous doubts during the session; save them for the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The pace will be quick due to the volume of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Sessions
The session concludes with a plan for future sessions, including a continuation of microbiology images tomorrow morning (11 AM) and a quick motivational/tip session on December 19th, one day before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>. Students are encouraged to manage stress and utilize available resources like LRR PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

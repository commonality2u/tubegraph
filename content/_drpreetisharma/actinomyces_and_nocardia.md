[[Gram Positive vs Gram Negative Cocci | Gram-positive bacilli]], including *Actinomyces* and *Nocardia*, are notable exceptions to the general rule that most bacilli are gram-negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. These bacteria, along with others, are often remembered using the "McDonald's" mnemonic for gram-positive bacilli (M for Mycobacteria, C for Clostridium and Bacillus (Anthrax), D for Corynebacterium *Diphtheriae*, N for *Nocardia* and *Actinomyces*, L for *Listeria*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Both *Nocardia* and *Actinomyces* are characterized as gram-positive branching, filamentous rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Distinguishing Characteristics

While both are filamentous gram-positive rods, *Actinomyces* and *Nocardia* have key differences in their aerobic requirements, acid-fastness, and typical habitats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>:

| Feature           | *Nocardia*                                      | *Actinomyces*                                   |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Oxygen Needs**  | Strict aerobe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>           | Strict anaerobe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>        |
| **Acid-Fast**     | Acid-fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>                       | Generally not acid-fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a> (except *A. israelii* can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>) |
| **Habitat**       | Exogenous; found in nature (soil, dust, air) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a> | Endogenous; found in the mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a> |

## Nocardia

*Nocardia* is linked to "nature" due to its environmental habitat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.

### Clinical Manifestations
*   Inhalation of *Nocardia* from the environment can lead to pulmonary disease, often mimicking [[tuberculosis_disease_overview | tuberculosis (TB)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.
*   It can also disseminate to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.
*   Unlike [[tuberculosis_disease_overview | TB]], lymphadenopathy is usually absent in nocardiosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

### Diagnosis
*   **Culture Media:** Paraffin bait technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a> is used for *Nocardia* culture. It requires carbon dioxide (CO2), which is provided by paraffin as a "bait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **Staining:** Given its acid-fast property, *Nocardia* will appear reddish on acid-fast stains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.

### Treatment
The drug of choice for *Nocardia* infections is sulfonamides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

## Actinomyces

*Actinomyces* are part of the normal flora of the mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.

### Clinical Manifestations
*   **Oral/Jaw Infections:** These are the most common infections caused by *Actinomyces*, often occurring after dental procedures like tooth extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. Patients may present with nodular jaw swelling and a discharge containing "sulfur-colored granules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   **Female Genital Tract Infection:** Increased risk of *Actinomyces* infection in [[intra_uterine_contraceptive_device | IUD]] users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

### Diagnosis
*   **Gross Appearance (Sulfur Granules):** Yellow granules discharged from jaw swelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.
*   **Culture Morphology:** On solid agar, *Actinomyces* typically forms "molar tooth colonies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Appearance:** In Pap smears, *Actinomyces* may show a "cotton ball appearance," "woolly ball appearance," or "sunray appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. These are also known as Gupta bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.
*   **Splendore-Hoeppli Phenomenon:** A characteristic finding where the central bacterial colony is surrounded by an eosinophilic, radiating "pinkish color line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. This phenomenon represents an antigen-antibody immune complex reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a> and is also seen in Sporothrix schenckii (rose gardener's disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.

### Treatment
The drug of choice for *Actinomyces* infections is penicillin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

## Introduction
[[gram_positive_bacilli | Gram positive bacilli]] are typically identified by a mnemonic "McDonald's", where "M" stands for Mycobacteria, "A" for [[anthrax_types_and_diagnosis | Anthrax]], and "C" for [[clostridium_infections_like_tetanus_botulism_and_pseudomembranous_colitis | Clostridium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Both *Bacillus* and *Clostridium* are [[spore_forming_bacteria_bacillus_and_clostridium | spore-forming bacteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Morphology
*Bacillus anthracis* is characterized by a "bamboo stick" or "box car" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. These bacteria may appear with a white hole in the center, indicating the presence of spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. Spores are not easily visible on routine staining, requiring special stains like Schaeffer and Fulton stain or modified Ashworth stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>.

## Culture Characteristics
*   **Nutrient Agar**: *Bacillus anthracis* exhibits a "Medusa head appearance" on nutrient agar, resembling frizzy hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.
*   **Blood Agar**: On blood agar, colonies can show a "comet tail appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>, a "beaten egg appearance" (where the liquid becomes stringy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>, or a "frosted glass appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.
*   **Penicillin-containing Agar (PE Agar)**: When grown on penicillin agar, *Bacillus anthracis* produces a distinctive "string of pearls" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.
*   **Gelatin Stab Culture**: *Bacillus anthracis* is an aerobic organism, meaning it requires oxygen to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. In a gelatin stab culture, this leads to the "inverted fir tree appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>, where liquefaction occurs mostly at the oxygen-rich surface, resembling an upside-down tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>. In contrast, *Clostridium tetani*, an anaerobe, would show a "straight tree" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. A plain wire, not a nichrome loop, is used for gelatin stab inoculation to prevent disruption of the gelatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>.

## Virulence Factors
*Bacillus anthracis* possesses unique [[virulence_factors_of_bacillus_anthracis | virulence factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>:
*   **Capsule**: Unlike most bacteria with polysaccharide capsules, *Bacillus anthracis* has a polypeptide or poly-D-glutamic acid capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>. This capsule can be visualized using Polychrome Methylene Blue stain, which results in a purple material around the bacteria, known as the McFadyen reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.
*   **Anthrax Toxin**: The anthrax toxin is unusual because it is "tripartite," meaning it has three parts, unlike most toxins which are bipartite (two parts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. These three parts are:
    *   **Edema Factor (EF)**: Increases cyclic AMP, leading to edema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
    *   **Protective Antigen (PA)**: Facilitates the entry of other toxin components into cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>.
    *   **Lethal Factor (LF)**: Contributes to the highly lethal nature of the infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations and [[anthrax_types_and_diagnosis | Anthrax Types]]
[[anthrax_types_and_diagnosis | Anthrax]] can manifest in three main clinical forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>:
1.  **Cutaneous Anthrax (Hide Porter's Disease)**: Occurs through skin contact with infected animal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. It presents as a very blackish lesion known as a malignant ulcer or malignant acher (not to be confused with cancer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. This is typically seen on exposed body parts like the neck or shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.
    *   The "shepherd's thigh" is a clinical presentation associated with animal handlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.
    *   It differs from scrub typhus, which typically presents on hidden body areas like the axilla or groin, and involves a mite vector and shrubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
2.  **Pulmonary Anthrax (Wool Sorter's Disease)**: Results from inhaling wool fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. It causes pulmonary symptoms and is characterized by hemorrhagic mediastinitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.
3.  **Gastrointestinal Anthrax**: Acquired by ingesting uncooked meat from infected animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. It causes hemorrhagic enteritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.

A common feature across all forms is the "hemorrhagic" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

*Bacillus anthracis* is also recognized as a bioterrorism agent due to its lethality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.

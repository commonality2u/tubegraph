[[systemic_pathology_and_bacteriology | Bacillus anthracis]] is a bacterium known for causing anthrax. It is classified as a [[gram_positive_bacilli | Gram positive bacillus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Along with Clostridium, it belongs to the [[spore_forming_bacteria_bacillus_and_clostridium | spore-forming bacteria]] family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, meaning it produces spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Virulence Factors

[[types_and_virulence_factors_of_bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] possesses key virulence factors:
*   **Capsule** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>: Unlike most bacteria that have polysaccharide capsules, *Bacillus anthracis* has a unique polypeptide (specifically poly D-glutamic acid) capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>. This capsule can be visualized using the MacFadyen reaction with polychrome methylene blue stain, appearing as purple material around the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.
*   **Anthrax Toxin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>: Most bacterial toxins are bipartite (two parts), but the anthrax toxin is tripartite, meaning it has three components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>:
    *   **Edema Factor (EF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>: Increases cyclic AMP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
    *   **Protective Antigen (PA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.
    *   **Lethal Factor (LF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>: Responsible for its high lethality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations

*Bacillus anthracis* can present in various forms, often related to exposure to animals or animal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>:
*   **Hide Porter's Disease (Cutaneous Anthrax)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>: Occurs through contact with animal skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. It typically manifests on exposed areas like the neck or shoulder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. Clinically, it presents as a blackish lesion called a "malignant pustule" or "achar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. This lesion is typically hemorrhagic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.
*   **Wool Sorter's Disease (Pulmonary Anthrax)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>: Acquired by inhaling wool fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. It primarily causes pulmonary symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a> and is characterized by hemorrhagic mediastinitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.
*   **Gastrointestinal Anthrax** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>: Results from ingesting uncooked meat from infected animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. It leads to hemorrhagic enteritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.

### Diagnosis

*Bacillus anthracis* is an aerobic organism, meaning it requires oxygen for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.

#### Morphological Features
*   **Bamboo Stick/Box Car Appearance**: On Gram stain, *Bacillus anthracis* appears as long, rectangular rods arranged in chains, resembling bamboo sticks or boxcars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>. Spores are often visible as white holes within the bacilli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

#### Culture Media Appearances
*   **Nutrient Agar**: Colonies exhibit a characteristic "Medusa head" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>, with frizzy, tangled projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>.
*   **Blood Agar**:
    *   **Comet Tail Appearance**: Colonies may show a small "tail" extending from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>.
    *   **Beaten Egg Appearance**: When lifted, colonies can have a thick, stringy consistency, resembling beaten egg whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>.
    *   **Frosted Glass Appearance**: The surface of the colonies may appear dull and granular, like frosted glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.
*   **Penicillin Agar (PE)**: Growth on penicillin agar results in a "string of pearls" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Gelatin Stab Culture**: When *Bacillus anthracis* is stabbed into gelatin media using a plain wire (not a loop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>, it causes liquefaction of the gelatin only near the surface where oxygen is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>. This results in an "inverted fir tree appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>, differentiating it from *Clostridium tetani*, which is anaerobic and causes a "straight fir tree" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>.

### Spore Arrangement
While specific photos may suggest central spores, theoretically, *Bacillus anthracis* spores can vary in location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. Other [[spore_forming_bacteria_bacillus_and_clostridium | spore forming bacteria]] have characteristic spore arrangements:
*   **Terminal Spores**:
    *   *Clostridium tetani*: Round terminal spores, giving a "drumstick" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>.
    *   *Clostridium tertium*: Oval terminal spores, giving a "tennis racket" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>.
*   **Central Spores**:
    *   *Bacillus cereus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.
    *   *Clostridium bifermentans* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>.
*   **Subterminal Spores**:
    *   Most common type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>.
    *   Example: *Clostridium perfringens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.

### Bioterrorism Agent
[[types_and_virulence_factors_of_bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] is considered a bioterrorism agent due to its lethality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.

## Specific Gram Positive Bacilli

### [[corynebacterium_diphtheria | Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]

*   **Characteristics**
    *   [[bacterial_anatomy_and_physiology | Gram-positive bacilli]] that appear purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
    *   Form "Chinese letter" or "cuneiform" arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.
    *   Possess bulbous ends with large granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
    *   These granules are known as Volutin granules, Babes-Ernst granules, bipolar granules, or metachromatic granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
    *   They contain stored energy in the form of polymetaphosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
    *   **Albert stain** is used to visualize these granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
        *   Uses Toluidine blue, Iodine, and Malachite green (TIM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
        *   The bacteria stain green, and the granules stain purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This color shift from blue (Toluidine blue) to purple is an example of metachromasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.
    *   Produces a potent toxin that inhibits protein synthesis by ADP ribosylation of EF2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation**
    *   Causes sore throat, low-grade fever, and a thick gray membrane covering the tonsils and pharynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
    *   Can lead to "bull's neck" appearance due to lymphadenopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
    *   The most common complication is myocarditis, which can show a "tiger-striped" or "tabby cat" appearance in the heart due to fat deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis**
    *   Sample for culture should be taken from *under* the pseudomembrane, not the membrane itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
    *   **Culture Media**:
        *   **Enriched Media:** Loeffler's serum slope, allowing growth in 6-8 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. This is good for early diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.
        *   **Selective Media:** Potassium Tellurite agar (produces black colonies, but growth takes 48 hours) or Tinsdale agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. This is considered the best culture media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.
    *   **Toxigenicity Test:** Elek's gel precipitation test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Precipitant lines indicate toxin presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
    *   **Susceptibility Test:** Schick Test (an intradermal test, Type III Hypersensitivity reaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. A positive test (redness) indicates susceptibility, while a negative test indicates immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   **Treatment**
    *   First-line treatment includes antibiotics (penicillin and erythromycin) and diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.
    *   Dosage of DAT varies by disease severity (20,000-120,000 International Units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
    *   For neck disease or disease present for more than three days, half the dose is given intramuscularly (IM) and half intravenously (IV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.
    *   Droplet precautions are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

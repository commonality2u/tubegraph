Gram positive bacilli are a group of rod-shaped bacteria that stain purple with the Gram stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:40">[02:55:40]</a>. While most cocci are gram-positive and most bacilli are typically gram-negative, there are exceptions among bacilli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:33">[04:54:33]</a>.

A mnemonic for remembering gram-positive bacilli (GPB) is "MACDONALD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:47">[05:04:47]</a>, which stands for:

## Specific Gram Positive Bacilli

### Corynebacterium diphtheriae
*   **Clinical Presentation**
    *   Typically seen in a 7-year-old child with a sore throat, low-grade fever, and a thick pseudomembrane covering the tonsils and pharynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:40">[08:44:40]</a>.
    *   The pseudomembrane is characteristic, and samples for testing should be taken from *under* the membrane, as the membrane itself consists of dead cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:02">[10:59:02]</a>.
    *   Can lead to "bull's neck" due to lymphadenopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:05">[12:21:05]</a>.
    *   Immunization history may be unreliable; clinical symptoms are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:34">[36:16:34]</a>.
    *   The most common complication is myocarditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:17">[34:46:17]</a>, which can lead to "tiger and tabby cat" appearance of the heart due to fat deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:29:43">[34:29:43]</a>.
*   **Microscopy and Staining**
    *   Gram-positive bacilli appearing in a "Chinese letter" or "cuneiform" arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:21">[26:01:21]</a>.
    *   Characterized by bulbous ends containing large, dark-staining structures called Volutin granules (also known as Babes-Ernst granules, bipolar granules, or metachromatic granules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:17">[26:44:17]</a>. These granules store polymetaphosphate energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:22">[30:38:22]</a>.
    *   [[identification_of_bacterial_species|Albert stain]] is used to visualize these granules, making the bacteria appear green and the granules purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:07">[28:09:07]</a>. This phenomenon is called metachromasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:08">[28:24:08]</a>.
*   **Culture Media**
    *   Enrichment media: Loeffler's serum slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:47">[31:16:47]</a>. Growth typically occurs in 6-8 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:25:01">[31:25:01]</a>, useful for early diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:12">[32:18:12]</a>.
    *   Selective media: Potassium tellurite agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:43">[31:41:43]</a> or Tinsdale agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:09">[32:38:09]</a>. Tellurium gives a characteristic black color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:09">[31:50:09]</a>, but growth takes longer (48 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:02">[32:04:02]</a>. Considered the best culture media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:27:01">[32:27:01]</a>.
*   **Toxin Detection and Susceptibility**
    *   Elek gel precipitation test: Used to detect the presence of diphtheria toxin. Precipitant lines indicate toxin presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:04">[21:33:04]</a>.
    *   Schick Test: An intradermal test (Type III hypersensitivity) used to determine patient susceptibility to diphtheria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:57">[23:51:57]</a>. A positive test (redness) means the patient is susceptible, while a negative test means they are immune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:07">[25:07:07]</a>.
*   **Treatment**
    *   Diphtheria antitoxin: Doses vary based on disease severity (20k-120k International Units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:26">[40:30:26]</a>. For neck disease or disease present for more than three days, half the dose is given intramuscularly (IM) and half intravenously (IV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:07">[40:48:07]</a>.
    *   Antibiotics (Penicillin, Erythromycin) are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:18:04">[39:18:04]</a>.
    *   Droplet precautions are necessary as it spreads by droplet infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:30">[39:13:30]</a>.
*   **Other Corynebacterium species:**
    *   *Corynebacterium minutissimum:* Causes erythrasma (red rash), which shows coral red fluorescence under a Wood's lamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:17">[12:46:17]</a>.
    *   *Corynebacterium ulcerans:* Can cause respiratory symptoms but not the typical diphtheria features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:07">[13:20:07]</a>.
    *   *Corynebacterium jeikeium:* Known for causing endocarditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:57">[13:34:57]</a>.
    *   *Corynebacterium urealyticum:* Urealyticum is lipophilic and urease positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:07">[14:10:07]</a>.
    *   *Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis:* Primarily affects sheep; human cases are rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:13">[15:39:13]</a>.

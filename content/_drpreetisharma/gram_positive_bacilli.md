*   **C**lostridium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

## Corynebacterium

All Gram-positive bacteria typically stain purple, and bacilli appear as long rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### Corynebacterium diphtheriae
*   **Clinical Features**: Characterized by a sore throat, low-grade fever, and a thick membrane covering the tonsils and pharynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The child may present with a "bull's neck" due to lymphadenopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Sample Collection**: A sample should be taken from *under* the pseudomembrane, as the membrane itself contains dead cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Morphology**: Displays a "Chinese letter" or "cuneiform" arrangement due to its club-shaped appearance with bulbous ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. These ends contain large granules known as volutin granules, also called Babes-Ernst granules or bipolar granules due to their presence at two poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. They are also known as [[characteristics_of_gram_positive_and_gram_negative_cocci | metachromatic granules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   **Staining**:
    *   **Albert stain**: Uses three chemicals: toluidine blue, iodine, and malachite green (TIM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. The bacteria appear green, and the volutin granules are purple, demonstrating [[characteristics_of_gram_positive_and_gram_negative_cocci | metachromasia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. Toluidine blue is a metachromatic stain, also used for mast cells and basophils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.
*   **Granules**: Volutin granules contain polymetaphosphate, which serves as an energy reserve for the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
*   **Toxin**: Produces a potent toxin that targets the 60S ribosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. This toxin decreases protein synthesis through ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **[[Culture media for bacteria | Culture Media]]**:
    *   **Enriched media**: Loeffler's serum slope, which contains eggs, mineral salt solution, Fiersite green, and asparagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. It allows for early diagnosis, with bacterial growth in 6-8 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.
    *   **Selective media**: Potassium tellurite agar or Tinsdale agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. On tellurite agar, the bacteria produce black colonies, taking 48 hours to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. This is considered the best culture media for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.
*   **Tests for Diphtheria**:
    *   **Elx gel precipitation test**: Determines the toxigenicity of the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. It involves a culture medium with an antitoxin strip; if toxin is present, precipitant lines will form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
    *   **Schick Test**: An intradermal test used to determine the patient's susceptibility to diphtheria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. It is a Type III [[characteristics_of_gram_positive_and_gram_negative_cocci | hypersensitivity]] reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. A positive test (redness) indicates susceptibility, while a negative test indicates immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   **Complications**: The most common complication is myocarditis, which can show "tiger tabby cat appearance" due to fat deposition in the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. Other conditions causing fat deposition in the heart include cell injury and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.
*   **Treatment**: Requires droplet precautions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>, antibiotics (penicillin and erythromycin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>, and diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. The dose of antitoxin varies with disease severity (e.g., 20K-40K units for pharyngeal disease, 40K-60K for nasopharyngeal, 80K-120K for extensive disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. If the disease involves the neck or has lasted more than three days, half the dose is given intramuscularly (IM) and half intravenously (IV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.

### Other Corynebacterium species
*   ***Corynebacterium minutissimum***: Causes erythrasma, a red-colored rash that shows coral red fluorescence under Wood's lamp examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   ***Corynebacterium ulcerans***: Can cause respiratory symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   ***Corynebacterium jeikeium***: Known to cause endocarditis and is lipophilic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Bacillus Anthracis
*   **Characteristics**: [[Spore Forming Bacteria Bacillus and Clostridium | Spore-forming]] and aerobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.# Gram Positive Bacilli

## Bacillus Anthracis
*   **Characteristics**: [[Spore Forming Bacteria Bacillus and Clostridium | Spore-forming]] and aerobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.
*   **Virulence Factors**:
    *   **Capsule**: Unique for being composed of polypeptide (poly-D-glutamic acid), unlike other bacteria with polysaccharide capsules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.
    *   **Anthrax Toxin**: A tripartite toxin composed of three parts: edema factor, protective factor, and lethal factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. The edema factor increases cyclic AMP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
*   **Clinical Variations**:
    *   **Cutaneous Anthrax (Hide Porter's Disease)**: Occurs via contact with animal skin, often on exposed parts of the body like the neck or shoulder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. Presents as a very black, necrolytic lesion known as a malignant pustule or eschar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.
    *   **Pulmonary Anthrax (Sooter's Disease)**: Acquired by inhaling wool fibers, leading to respiratory symptoms and hemorrhagic mediastinitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.
    *   **Intestinal Anthrax**: Caused by ingesting uncooked meat from infected animals, resulting in hemorrhagic enteritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
    *   All forms are often characterized by the term "hemorrhagic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.
*   **Laboratory Diagnosis**:
    *   **Microscopy**: Appears as "bamboo stick" or "box car" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. Spores are visible as white holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.
    *   **[[Culture media for bacteria | Culture Media]] Appearances**:
        *   "String of pearls" appearance on penicillin agar (PE on PE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.
        *   "Medusa head" appearance on nutrient agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.
        *   "Comet tail" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>.
        *   "Beaten egg" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
        *   "Frosted glass" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
    *   **Gelatin Stab Test**: On gelatin agar, it shows an "inverted fir tree" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>. This is because *Bacillus anthracis* is aerobic, so it liquefies gelatin more effectively at the oxygen-rich surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.
    *   **[[Gram staining and other staining techniques | Staining]]**: Polychrome methylene blue is used to visualize the capsule, resulting in purple material around the bacteria, known as the McFadyean reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.
*   **Differentiation from Scrub Typhus**: Anthrax lesions (e.g., pustules) typically appear on exposed body parts due to direct contact with animal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. Scrub typhus lesions, on the other hand, are often in hidden or moist areas (e.g., axilla, groin) and are transmitted by mites associated with shrubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

## Clostridium
*   **Characteristics**: [[Spore Forming Bacteria Bacillus and Clostridium | Spore-forming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> and anaerobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>.
*   **Spore Location**:
    *   **Subterminal**: Most common, seen in *Clostridium perfringens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.
    *   **Terminal**: Located at the end of the rod. Round terminal spores are seen in *Clostridium tetani*, giving a "drumstick" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>. Oval terminal spores are seen in *Clostridium tertium*, giving a "tennis racket" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>.
    *   **Central**: Located in the middle. Seen in *Bacillus cereus* and *Clostridium bifermentans* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>.
*   ***Clostridium tetani***: Shows a "straight fir tree" appearance in the gelatin stab test, as it is anaerobic and grows throughout the medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
*   ***Clostridium perfringens***: Can cause gas gangrene and food poisoning, including "pig-bel" food poisoning from consuming pork and sweet potato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

## Listeria
*   **Motility**: Exhibits a characteristic "tumbling motility," resembling a drunk man falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. It also shows "differential motility," meaning its motility varies with temperature: it is motile at 22-25°C but non-motile at 35-37°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Nocardia
*   **Characteristics**: [[Gram negative bacilli | Gram-positive]], filamentous, and branching rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. It is a strict aerobe (requires oxygen) and partially acid-fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

It commonly causes pulmonary infections, which can mimic tuberculosis (TB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. Unlike TB, nocardiosis typically lacks hilar lymphadenopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. It can also spread to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.
*   **[[Culture media for bacteria | Culture]]**: Paraffin bait technique is used, which requires CO2 for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

## Actinomyces
*   **Characteristics**: [[Gram negative bacilli | Gram-positive]], filamentous, and branching rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. It is a strict anaerobe and usually non-acid-fast, though *Actinomyces israelii* can sometimes be partially acid-fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.
*   **Habitat**: Part of the endogenous flora, commonly found in the mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.

Discharges may contain "sulfur-colored granules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. It can also cause infections in the female genital tract, particularly in Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD) users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
*   **Morphology**:
    *   **Colony Appearance**: On solid agar, it forms "molar tooth colonies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>.
    *   **Microscopy**: Appears as "cotton ball," "woolly ball," or "sunray" appearance, also known as Gupta bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.
*   **Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon**: Characterized by an eosinophilic, radiating asteroid-like material around the bacterial colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>. This phenomenon is an antigen-antibody complex reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. It is also seen in rose gardener's disease (Sporothrix schenckii) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.
*   **Treatment**: Penicillin is the drug of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

## Mycobacteria (Tuberculosis - TB)
*   **Characteristics**: Aerobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.
*   **[[Culture media for bacteria | Culture]]**:
    *   **Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium**:
        *   **Composition**: Contains eggs, mineral salt solution, malachite green, and asparagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>. Malachite green gives it a greenish color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a>.
        *   **Growth Time**: Takes approximately 6-8 weeks for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>. Rapid growers (atypical mycobacteria) can produce colonies within one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.
        *   **Colony Appearance**: Shows "rough, buff, tough" colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:53">[01:23:53]</a>. "Buff" refers to a creamy, off-white color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12">[01:24:12]</a>. In contrast, *Mycobacterium bovis* produces "smooth, white, weaker" colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.
*   **[[Gram staining and other staining techniques | Staining]]**: Decolorized by 20-25% sulfuric acid in ZN staining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.
*   **Diagnostics**:
    *   **MGIT (Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube)**: Detects mycobacterial growth by using an indicator that fluoresces when oxygen is consumed by the growing bacteria. No fluorescence occurs in the presence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>.
    *   **GeneXpert (Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test - CBNAAT)**: A rapid (turnaround time of ~2 hours) diagnostic method for TB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>. It not only diagnoses TB but also detects resistance to rifampicin (due to mutations in the RPOB gene) and isoniazid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:42">[01:31:42]</a>.
*   **Treatment**: Most anti-tuberculosis drugs are bactericidal, except for ethambutol, which is bacteriostatic (stops bacterial growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>.
*   **PPD (Purified Protein Derivative)**: Used in the Mantoux test, an intradermal skin test for TB, where a low dose of TB bacillus extract is injected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>.

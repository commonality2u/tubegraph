[[Sterilization and disinfection methods | Sterilization and disinfection]] are crucial processes in microbiology, employing various physical and [[Chemical methods of disinfection | chemical methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This article focuses on the physical method of heat, specifically [[Sterilization and disinfection methods | dry heat]] and [[Sterilization and disinfection methods | moist heat sterilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Heat is a primary method that generates a maximum number of questions in examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

## Dry Heat Sterilization

[[Sterilization and disinfection methods | Dry heat sterilization]] involves heating without the presence of fumes or steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

### Hot Air Oven
The hot air oven functions similarly to a household oven used for baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Items Sterilized**: This method is suitable for sterilizing glassware (like flasks and test tubes), syringes, cotton swabs, and greasy materials such as [[Sterilization and disinfection methods | liquid paraffin]] and paraffin wax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **Temperature and Time**: The usual protocol for a hot air oven is 160°C for two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
*   **Control**: To ensure the machine is working effectively, [[Microbiological tests and culture media | bacterial spores]] are used as a control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. If the spores are killed at 160°C for two hours, it confirms the glassware is sterilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. Common controls include *Bacillus subtilis*, *Bacillus atrophaeus*, and *Clostridium tetani* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. When both *Bacillus* and *Clostridium* are options, *Bacillus* species are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

> **Answer**: *Bacillus subtilis* is the best choice when multiple options are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. Other options include *Bacillus atrophies* and *Clostridium tetani* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

### Incineration
Incineration plants are large facilities, often found at the back of hospitals, used for disposing of various waste materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: It is used to incinerate hospital waste, animal waste, and human body part waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
*   **Temperature**: Incineration occurs at a high temperature of 1100-1200°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

> ##### Question: Which of the following is done for (incineration is done for) human body parts syringes body fluids or gloves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>
> **Answer**: Human body parts and hospital waste are incinerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.

## Moist Heat Sterilization

[[Sterilization and disinfection methods | Moist heat sterilization]] involves heat in the presence of moisture. Methods are categorized by temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>:

### Below 100°C
*   **Pasteurization**: Primarily used for milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
    *   **Holder Method**: Milk is held at 63°C for 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.
    *   **Flash Method**: Milk is heated to 72°C for 20 seconds, then immediately cooled to 13°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. The flash method is considered better as it can kill *Coxiella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.

    > ##### Question: Pasteurization of milk is done at what <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>
    > **Answer**: 63°C for 30 minutes (Holder method) or 72°C for 20 seconds (Flash method) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

*   **Inspissation**: This method involves heating at 80°C for 30 minutes, repeated over three consecutive days (80-30-80-30-80-30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.
    *   **Use**: It is used for sterilizing [[Culturing methods and culture media for various pathogens | culture media]] like LJ (Lowenstein Jensen) media for tuberculosis and LSS (Löffler's Serum Slope) media for Corynebacterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

### At 100°C
*   **Boiling**: Simple boiling of water at 100°C for approximately 15-20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. A key limitation is that boiling does not kill spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Tyndalization**: This technique involves heating at 100°C for 20 minutes, repeated over three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. It is designed to kill spores that might germinate between heating cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.

### Above 100°C
*   **Autoclave**: This is a widely used method for sterilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
    *   **Parameters**: The standard setting for an autoclave is 121°C, 15 psi (pounds per square inch) pressure, for 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>.
    *   **Items Sterilized**: Autoclaves are used for various items, including glassware (flasks, test tubes), operating room instruments, aprons, sutures (except catgut), [[Culture media for microbiology | culture media]], and sputum samples (before discarding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.
    *   **Exceptions**: Catgut sutures will lose their strength and elasticity if autoclaved at high temperatures and are therefore not put in an autoclave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>. LJ media and LSS media are also exceptions, as they are sterilized by inspissation, not autoclaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
    *   **Prion Killing**: For killing prion proteins, the temperature is increased to 134°C, and the time is extended to 1.5 hours (90 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. The pressure can remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.
    *   **Control**: The control organism for an autoclave is *Bacillus stearothermophilus*, which has the ability to survive at very high temperatures but is killed at 121°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

    > ##### Question: How are prions destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>
    > **Answer**: Autoclaving at approximately 134°C for 1.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>.

| Plasma Sterilization (H2O2)| *Bacillus stearothermophilus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>     |

## Testing of Disinfectants

Four tests are used to assess the efficacy and properties of a disinfectant solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>:
1.  **Phenol Coefficient Test / Rideal Walker Test**: This test compares the solution's efficacy against phenol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. Its drawback is that it only compares against phenol, not considering other factors like organic matter or specific microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.
2.  **Modified Rideal Walker Test / Chick Martin Test**: A modification that tests the disinfectant in the presence of organic matter (like soil) and its ability to kill yeast, fungus, and spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.
3.  **Kelsey Sykes Test**: This test determines the "capacity" or reusability of the disinfectant, indicating how many times it can be repeatedly used effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.
4.  **Kelsey Modder Test**: This is an "in-use" test that assesses the practical effectiveness of the disinfectant in a real-world setting, such as a clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.

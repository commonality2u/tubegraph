Rapid Revision (RR) videos are a key component of exam preparation, especially for subjects like pathology and microbiology, but their effectiveness depends on the individual's prior knowledge and strategic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## When to Use Rapid Revision Videos

If a student has already covered approximately 85-90% of the syllabus from other sources, Rapid Revision videos are generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. They are particularly useful for:
*   Completing daily study targets for subjects like pathology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   Preparing for [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | Last Minute Rapid Revision (LRR)]] sessions which occur closer to the exam date (e.g., January and February for NEET PG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. These sessions aim to cover previous year questions (PYQs) and integrate concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   Interns, who have limited time for in-depth study, are advised to focus on RR videos combined with Q-banks for all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

## Subjects Requiring Main Videos

For certain "bulky" or "deadly" subjects, relying solely on Rapid Revision might not provide sufficient in-depth information. These subjects often contribute a significant number of questions in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. It is recommended to refer to main videos for:
*   Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   OBGY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine), as RR might not offer the necessary detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
*   Anatomy, especially if a student is weak in the subject, as RR could be "further torture" without foundational understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

Additionally, for "nightmare subjects" like anatomy, biochemistry, and pharmacology, it is advisable to revisit main videos to overcome the fear and ensure thorough understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

## Enhancing Effectiveness

To maximize the benefit of rapid revision:
*   **Supplement with Question Banks:** RR videos alone are not sufficient. They must be complemented with extensive practice from question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. This integration helps bridge knowledge gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.
    *   For bulky subjects, use the main Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.
    *   For short subjects, the RR Q-bank can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.
*   **Active Practice:** Aim to solve 100-150 questions per day to build confidence and reinforce learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Strategic Study:** If using RR, allocate time efficiently. For instance, a subject typically given five days in a study plan could be completed in three days using RR, freeing up time for question practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

## Limitations of Solely Relying on RR

Using only Rapid Revision videos for subjects that require in-depth understanding, or expecting a high rank from just a few hours of RR content per subject, is considered a "very bad decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. They are best for revision and as a supplementary tool, not as the primary and sole source of learning for all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.

## [[utilizing_rapid_revision_versus_main_videos_for_preparation | Integrating with Study Plans]]

Rapid revision is incorporated into a comprehensive study plan that includes multiple rounds of revision, daily targets, and mock tests. For instance, [[pathology_and_rapid_revision_approach | Kickstart Morning Sessions]], which focus on MCQ-based discussions, are initiated only after students have completed one round of rapid revision for subjects like pathology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This ensures a foundational understanding before moving to advanced practice.

It's crucial to stick to one's chosen study platform and not frequently switch between sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. The key is consistent application of the chosen resources, whether they are main videos or rapid revision, in conjunction with practice questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.

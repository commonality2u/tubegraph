Preparing for the [[neet_pg_2025_preparation_strategies | NEET PG]] exam involves strategic planning and effective utilization of various study resources. Given the unpredictability of exam dates, the focus should be on creating a flexible and comfortable study plan that can be adapted as new information emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Developing a Study Plan and Time Management
The current proposed plan is a 65-day study schedule, designed to balance subjects and include occasional grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. For interns, this plan can be extended by adding 2-3 days for long subjects and one day for short subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Discipline and Consistency
Creating a [[time_table_for_neet_pg_exam_preparation | timetable]] is easy, but adhering to it requires significant discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. Consistent effort, even when others are not studying, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. It is important to allocate specific time slots for studies, internships, social media, and family to avoid mental exhaustion, especially without a fixed deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

### Subject-Wise Approach
For first-time test-takers or those currently in their internship, a subject-wise approach is recommended over a system-wise one to ensure comprehensive coverage of all fundamental topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. If this is a second, third, or fourth revision (e.g., for [[neet_pg_2024_preparation_strategy | NEET PG 2024]] candidates), a system-wise approach can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:32]</a>.

**Proposed 65-Day Schedule (Approximate)**:
*   Anatomy: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>
*   ENT: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>
*   Pathology: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>
*   Microbiology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>
*   PSM: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>
*   OBGY: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>
*   Ophthalmology: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>
*   Pharmacology: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>
*   Physiology: 2 days (often covered later, integrating with other subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>
*   Medicine: 1 to 1.5 hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>

## Key Study Resources and Their Integration
### Notes and Volatile Topics
*   **Personalized "20th Notebook"**: Create a separate notebook, or "chy copy," solely for volatile topics and Grand Test (GT) mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This notebook should list topic names, not rewritten text, and should be customized based on individual forgetting patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on topics, not bulk**: The goal is to create a concise list of difficult topics (e.g., 50 for pathology, 50 for microbiology, 30 for anatomy) to aid revision in the last 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

### Video Lectures
*   **Rapid Revision Videos**: Recommended for pathology (approx. 20 hours) and microbiology (approx. 15 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. If previously viewed, stick to the same version (e.g., RR 5.0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. For those viewing for the first time, go directly to the latest version (e.g., RR 6.0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.
*   **Main Videos**: For working doctors, relying heavily on [[recommended_study_resources_and_video_lectures | rapid revision]] videos is necessary as main videos are time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>. Only refer to main videos for specific topics that are difficult to understand from rapid revision (e.g., heart sounds, ECG in medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.
*   **Passive vs. Active Learning**: Watching videos is passive learning, useful for initial understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>. After understanding, focus on active recall through notes and MCQs. Re-watching videos repeatedly is often not necessary if the content was understood recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>.

### Question Banks (QBank) and Custom Modules
*   **Daily MCQ Practice**: Dedicate one hour every morning to solving MCQs using custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>. Start with questions from subjects already completed, then gradually include more subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.
*   **Full QBank vs. RR QBank**: If you have completed one round of revision, the RR QBank can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>. For the first-time QBank attempt, do the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>.
*   **Integration with Medicine**: Read 1-1.5 hours of medicine daily. This acts as "clinical posting" or "patient exposure" to integrate knowledge across subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)
### Purpose of GTs
GTs are primarily a guide to identify weak areas and manage time, not just for scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>. Initially, three GTs in 65 days are suggested, but this can be increased to one every 15 days or even weekly if comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

### GT Analysis
*   **Immediate Analysis**: Analyze incorrect answers and questions where there was confusion between options on the same day as the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:24:00">[36:24:00]</a>.
*   **Layered Analysis**:
    1.  **Incorrects**: Focus on understanding why questions were wrong.
    2.  **Confused/Guessed**: Review questions where you were confused or took an intelligent guess.
    3.  **Corrects**: Briefly scan explanations for correct answers to reinforce knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>.
*   **Actionable Insights**: GT analysis should reveal weak subjects (e.g., factual subjects like biochemistry, pharmacology, microbiology) or issues with time management or McQ attempting skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>. Adjust your study plan based on these insights. For instance, if factual questions are missed, prioritize first and second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:23:00">[26:23:00]</a>.
*   **Overcoming GT Fear**: To overcome the fear of GTs, change the perception by calling them "custom modules" or "practice question modules" instead of "Grand Tests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:07:00">[43:07:00]</a>. Start with smaller sets of mixed questions and gradually build comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a>.

## Specific Resource-Related Advice
*   **Telegram Quizzes**: [[fmge_december_2024_exam_preparation | FMGE]] quizzes are scheduled for December, and [[neet_pg_2025_preparation_strategies | NEET PG]] specific quizzes on Prepladder will be in January and February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. [[fmge_exam_preparation strategies | NEET PG]] students should attempt [[fmge_exam_preparation tips | FMGE]] quizzes as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **YouTube Live Classes**: Scheduled for February, focusing on MCQ solving techniques rather than theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Choosing Educators**: Select teachers from whom you understand concepts best and whose teaching helps improve your strike rate in questions (e.g., above 80% for a topic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.
*   **Platform Loyalty**: It is generally advisable to stick to one platform for notes and videos to avoid confusion, as 90% of content is similar across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>. However, free grand tests from all platforms should be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:21:00">[45:21:00]</a>.

## Adaptability and Mindset
*   **Customization**: The provided [[time_table_for_neet_pg_exam_preparation | timetable]] is a suggestion and needs to be customized based on individual situations, especially for working doctors or interns who may need to add extra days per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>.
*   **Health as Priority**: Physical and mental health should always be prioritized over exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:05:00">[24:05:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace Mistakes**: Make as many mistakes as possible during practice tests to learn from them, rather than fearing failure in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Start Today, Not Tomorrow
> "Start with whatever 2-3 hours you can. If you can't do anything, at least declutter your study table, clean it well, get all your 19 copies, books together at least so that tomorrow morning 7:00 when you wake up to study you know exactly what to do, you're not wasting any more time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:27:00">[48:27:00]</a>

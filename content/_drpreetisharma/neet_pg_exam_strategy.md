The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET PG) is a crucial examination for medical graduates in India. This article outlines an effective [[neet_pg_2024_preparation_strategy | NEET PG preparation strategy]] to help students target the exam, specifically focusing on the approach for NEET PG 2025, considering the unpredictable nature of exam dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## General Approach and Planning

Given the uncertainty of the NEET PG exam date, it's essential to create a flexible plan that can be adapted as new information becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A preliminary plan allows students to make the most of the time available, rather than waiting for an official date which might be announced too close to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### The 65-Day Plan
A 65-day plan is proposed, designed to be comfortable for all students, whether they are drops or interns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This plan balances subjects and includes occasional Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. For interns, it's advised to add 2-3 extra days for long subjects and one day for short subjects to accommodate their schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The proposed [[time_table_for_neet_pg_2024 | timetable for NEET PG 2024]] includes:
*   Anatomy: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   ENT: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   Pathology: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   Microbiology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   PSM: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   OBGYN: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   Ophthalmology (Ophthal): 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>
*   Pharmacology (Pharma): 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Physiology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>

## Study Methods

### Subject-wise vs. System-wise Study
For students undertaking their second, third, or fourth revision, a system-wise approach is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, for freshers, interns, or those taking the exam for the first time, a subject-wise approach is recommended. System-wise study might lead to missing out on general subjects like general pathology, general microbiology, general pharmacology, general surgery, and biochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Incorporating Medicine
Medicine is an extensive subject and trying to finish it in one stretch can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. It is advisable to dedicate 1 to 1.5 hours to medicine every day, treating it like a "clinical posting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This consistent daily study integrates medicine throughout the 65-day plan, making it less toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Set a fixed time for medicine study, such as 10 PM every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### Utilizing Notes and Rapid Revision
*   **Main Notes vs. Rapid Revision (RR) Videos**: For subjects like Pathology and Microbiology, it's recommended to use rapid revision videos (e.g., RR 6.0 or stick to RR 5.0 if previously viewed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Rapid revision notes consolidate extensive main video content into a faster, more digestible format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   **First-time viewers**: If you haven't viewed any videos, start directly with RR 6.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. If you get stuck on a topic in RR, refer back to the corresponding main video for clarity, then return to RR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.
*   **Passive Learning**: Avoid getting stuck in a loop of watching videos repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Videos are for initial understanding. Subsequent revisions should focus on notes and active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

### Volatile Topics / "20th Notebook"
Create a separate notebook (sometimes called a "20th notebook" or "chy copy") specifically for volatile topics and Grand Test mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Content**: This notebook should *only* contain the names of topics or specific points you tend to forget, not extensive re-written text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. For example, "incubation periods read from Rapid revision" or "Hepatitis B graph from Rapid revision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Personalization**: Make your own 20th notebook as what one person forgets, another might remember easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This notebook will be crucial for quick revision in the last 10-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

Grand Tests are essential guides for your preparation, not just measures of your score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: To start, three Grand Tests in 65 days are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. If comfortable, increase to one GT every 15 days, or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   Immediately after the GT, perform a subject-wise analysis of incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.
    *   Identify whether mistakes were factual or clinical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.
    *   Focus on rectifying weaknesses: if factual questions are missed, strengthen first and second-year subjects (e.g., Micro, Pharma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. If clinical questions are missed, practice more from Medicine and Surgery custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.
    *   Analyze questions where you were confused between options or made a safe guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.
    *   For correct answers, quickly scan explanations to reinforce knowledge, but don't spend excessive time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.
*   **Overcoming GT Fear**: Start by practicing custom modules with a mixed bag of questions and set a timer, rather than immediately taking full GTs, to build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. View GTs as a "practice question module" rather than a "Grand Test" to reduce anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.

## Specific Subject Advice

*   **Anatomy**: If anatomy is challenging, study it alongside allied subjects like Orthopedics, Surgery, and Radiology, as they will frequently reinforce anatomical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   **Pathology & Microbiology**: Rapid revision videos are highly recommended (20 hours for Path, 15 hours for Micro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Physiology**: It's suggested to study Physiology towards the end of your preparation. Having covered other subjects like Medicine and Pathology will make Physiology easier to grasp as it overlaps with many concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Ophthalmology & ENT**: These subjects are often tough for students, hence 3 days are allocated for each in the 65-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. If particularly weak, consider main videos, otherwise rely on rapid revision and extensive MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
*   [[preparation_strategies_for_parasitology_exams | Parasitology]]: While main notes provide extensive detail, for parasitology, rapid revision may suffice to solve required questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>.

## Mindset and Discipline

*   **Discipline**: Creating a timetable is easy, but following it requires immense discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Avoid the habit of making a new timetable every day due to backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Time Management**: Allocate specific time frames ("time boxes") for studies, internships, social media, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Mental Health**: Avoid mental exhaustion, especially when there's no immediate deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Take it easy with your mindset, even if the timetable is rigorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Prioritize health (physical and mental) above everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

## Tools and Resources

*   **Telegram Quizzes**: For NEET PG students, specific quizzes will occur on the PrepLadder app in January and February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, it's recommended to also attempt the [[fmge_december_2023_exam_preparation_strategy | FMGE December 2023 exam preparation strategy]] quizzes on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **YouTube Live Classes**: Live sessions focusing on solving MCQs and teaching the art of solving them, rather than just repeating theory, will be held in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **QBank (Question Bank)**:
    *   **Custom Modules**: Dedicate 1 hour every morning to solve MCQs using custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Initially, focus on subjects already completed. As more subjects are covered, expand the custom module to include all subjects, effectively creating a mini-Grand Test of 50 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
    *   **RRQ Bank vs. Full Q Bank**: If you've done one round of revision, RRQ Bank can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. If it's your first time, do the full Q Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
*   **Platform Usage**: Stick to one platform for notes and videos to avoid confusion and over-reliance on multiple sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. However, utilize free Grand Tests offered on *all* platforms, as each platform's tests are curated by different educators, similar to the varied nature of the actual NEET PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

## For Interns and Working Doctors
If you are an intern or working doctor, customize the timetable by adding 1-2 days per subject based on your work schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Heavily rely on rapid revision predominantly, as covering main videos might be next to impossible given limited study hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Only fall back to main videos for specific topics you struggle to understand from rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

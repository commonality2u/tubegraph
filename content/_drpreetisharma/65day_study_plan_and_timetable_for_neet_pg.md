This session provides a comprehensive 65-day study plan specifically designed for students targeting [[neet_pg_2025_preparation_strategy | NEET PG 2025]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the exam date, emphasizing the importance of planning now rather than waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The plan is designed to be flexible and adaptable for various student situations, including those who have taken a drop or are currently undergoing internships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The 65-Day Timetable

This plan is structured to balance subjects and include occasional Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. For interns, it's advised to add 2-3 extra days for longer subjects and one extra day for shorter ones to accommodate their schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Subject Allocation:

## Key Strategies and Recommendations

### 1. Daily Routine & Integration
*   **Medicine**: Integrate medicine into your daily schedule by studying 1 to 1.5 hours every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This approach makes it less overwhelming than trying to cover 70-80 hours in one go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Fix a specific time for medicine study, such as 10 PM daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Morning MCQs**: Dedicate 1 hour every morning to solving custom module MCQs from subjects you have already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Start with 50 questions in 50 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

### 2. Volatile Topics and Revision Notebook
*   Create a dedicated "20th notebook" or "chy copy" for volatile topics and mistakes made in Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   This notebook should *only* list topics, not full notes, to avoid becoming bulkier than your original notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   Make this notebook *personally* as you know what you tend to forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. For example, list "incubation periods" or "Hepatitis B graph" with a note to revisit from rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This will be crucial in the last 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### 3. Study Approach
*   **Subject-wise vs. System-wise**: If this is your first time studying for [[neet_pg_preparation_strategy | NEET PG]], follow a subject-wise approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. System-wise can lead to missing general topics like general pathology, microbiology, or pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. If you've done multiple revisions, system-wise is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision (RR) vs. Main Videos**:
    *   For Pathology (approx. 20 hours) and Microbiology (approx. 15 hours), [[neet_pg_preparation_strategy | Rapid Revision]] videos are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
    *   If you have previously watched RR 5.0, stick to it and review the PDF for added topics in RR 6.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. If you're new, go directly to RR 6.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
    *   RR notes are generally sufficient; there's no need to refer back to main notes for Path and Micro unless a concept is entirely unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
    *   Working doctors or interns should heavily rely on RR videos, using main videos only for specific, difficult topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Video Usage**: Watch videos for initial understanding, but subsequent revisions should be done from your notes to encourage active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Re-watch videos only for specific topics you can't grasp from notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

### 4. Grand Tests (GTs)
*   **Frequency**: For students not comfortable with their syllabus, aim for three GTs in 65 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. If you're more confident, take one GT every 15 days or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Analysis is Key**: Focus on analyzing your GT performance rather than just the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
    *   Identify incorrect answers, questions where you were confused, and areas where you guessed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
    *   Analyze subject-wise: Where are you going wrong (factual vs. clinical questions)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
    *   Use GTs as a guide to identify weaker subjects <a class="yt=timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Strengthening factual subjects (e.g., Micro, Pharma, first/second-year subjects) can significantly improve scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
*   **Overcoming GT Fear**: Take GTs frequently to desensitize yourself to the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Think of it as finishing your "failing quota" before the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. If the term "Grand Test" causes anxiety, label your practice sessions as "custom modules" or "practice question modules" instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.
*   **QBank Strategy**: For first-timers, do the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. After one revision, you can transition to RR QBank or continue with the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Attempt free GTs on all platforms as they are made by different sets of examiners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

### 5. Discipline and Well-being
*   **Discipline**: Adhering to the timetable requires significant discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Avoid the habit of making a new timetable every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Time Management**: Break down your day into time-boxes, allocating specific time for studies, internship, social media, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Health Priority**: Prioritize your physical and mental health above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. An exam is important, but health is life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Avoid mental exhaustion, especially when there's no immediate deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### 6. Subject-Specific Tips
*   **Anatomy**: It can be overwhelming. Pair it with allied subjects like Orthopedics, Surgery, and Radiology, as they will repeatedly reinforce anatomical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   **Biochemistry & Pharmacology**: For rote learning subjects like these, employ active recall methods like covering notes and quizzing yourself or a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.
*   **Ophthalmology & ENT**: These subjects are considered tough. The increased time allocation in the timetable reflects this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. If struggling with Ophthalmology, consider main videos, otherwise stick to rapid revision and extensive MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

### 7. Revisions
*   The first reading/revision should be extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   Subsequent revisions should gradually narrow down to filtered or volatile topics, eventually leading to a quick 10-day revision focusing only on volatile points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

This [[neet_pg_preparation_strategy | NEET PG preparation strategy]] emphasizes consistent effort, smart planning, and self-awareness to maximize study effectiveness.

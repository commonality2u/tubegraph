This session is primarily targeted towards the upcoming FMG exam to help students revise images and alleviate anxiety during their [[Exam preparation strategies | exam preparation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The aim is to provide essential knowledge and ease nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Study Strategy for Last Few Days

*   **Review LRR Sessions:** Focus on the "Last Rapid Revision" (LRR) sessions for Pathology and Microbiology conducted in November and December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The content covered in this specific session (approximately 1 hour 15 minutes) does not require further revision after studying it live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Mental Well-being:** Before starting any session, take a deep breath to manage stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Keeping your nerves in check is crucial for surviving till the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The arrival of admit cards can increase palpitations, so it's important to calm down before studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Passive Learning:** If you find it difficult to study on your own, passive learning (like attending this session) is highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Engage in any class to gain knowledge if self-study is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Session Etiquette:**
    *   Avoid watching the session at 2x speed; the speaker will try to maintain a fast pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   Hold miscellaneous doubts until the end of the session, after exam-going students have left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Next Steps for FMGE Preparation

The session will continue with microbiology images on the following day at 11 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.
*   **Stay Hydrated and Rest:** Incorporate sleep and relaxation time into your [[Daily study schedule for FMGE | daily study schedule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overthinking:** It is normal to feel like you've forgotten everything or that answers are mixing up before the exam; this indicates you've studied a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.
*   **Mindset is Key:** In the final days, focus on maintaining a composed mindset. Panic can make you forget what you've learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. Trust that your brain will recall information during the exam when focused on a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.
*   **Exam Day Tips:** Specific [[Essential exam day checklist for FMGE | exam day checklist for FMGE]] and [[Time management techniques for FMGE | time management techniques for FMGE]] tips will be provided closer to the exam date (e.g., on the 19th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

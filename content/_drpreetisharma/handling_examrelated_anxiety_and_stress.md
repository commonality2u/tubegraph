Effective [[managing_exam_anxiety | management of exam-related anxiety]] and stress is crucial, especially in the final days leading up to an examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. These last days are often described as "make or break," where the right approach can significantly impact performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Strategies for Mental Well-being

### Cultivating Positivity and Avoiding Negativity
A primary focus should be on positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This means:
*   **Surround yourself with positive influences** Talk only to people who offer positive vibes, such as parents, siblings, or good friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Teachers can also provide guidance and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Avoid negative discussions** Stay away from individuals who boast about their revisions or high grand test scores, or those who spread illogical rumors about exam difficulty or pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Block negative thoughts** Do not allow negative thought processes to enter your mind, as a single negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Wasting a day on negative thoughts can impact multiple subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Managing Sleep and Alertness
Normalize your sleep cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Since the exam occurs during the day, it's essential to be alert during morning hours (9 AM, 10 AM, 11 AM) to solve questions with full attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Aim for a minimum of six hours of productive sleep nightly to ensure your brain functions optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Avoid sleepless nights or experimenting with medications, as this can lead to mental blanks or unexpected side effects during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

### Allocating Time for Sanity
Dedicate about 30 minutes daily to maintain your sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This time should be spent away from books and can include:
*   A light walk or outdoor activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   Briefly engaging with social media or reels, but strictly for 30 minutes to avoid it stretching into hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
This small break helps prevent mental exhaustion and makes life feel more normal during intense study periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

### Approach to Grand Tests (GTs)
When deciding whether to take a grand test in the final days, consider your psychological resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **If you are not strong-hearted**, avoid GTs if you score below 150, as the resulting panic and anxiety could hinder your studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **If you are mentally strong** and can handle any score positively, then take the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
Regardless of your choice, the purpose of a GT in the last days should *not* be to assess your score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Instead, focus on:
*   [[time_management_and_study_planning_for_exams | Time management]]: Can you finish 300 questions within the allotted time, with minutes left over? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   Identifying [[role_of_selfanalysis_and_adaptability_in_exam_preparation | silly mistakes]]: Use the GT to pinpoint where you're making errors due to carelessness, not lack of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Overcoming the Feeling of Forgetting
It is normal to feel like you are forgetting subjects, especially volatile ones like Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. No one can memorize all 19 subjects perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. If you forget something, simply pick it up and revise it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Do not let this feeling lead to depression or negativity, which can cause you to stop studying and drastically lower your score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

### Managing Exam Day Psychology
Mentally prepare for the actual exam day:
*   **Expect varied paper difficulty:** One paper might be easy, and the other tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. Do not get demotivated if the first paper is difficult; disconnect from it during the break and focus entirely on the second paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. Your overall pass is determined by combining both papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.
*   **Don't overthink logistics:** Avoid worrying about things like your alarm ringing, reaching the center, or computer issues, as these are endless negative possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. Focus only on the immediate study task at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
*   **Sustain concentration:** Practice sitting for extended periods (3 to 3.5 hours) without breaks, phone, or distractions to build stamina for the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. In the exam, you need to attempt a new question every 45 seconds with sustained alertness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.

### Dealing with Low Scores
If you are stuck between 130 and 150 in GTs, quickly analyze where you are making mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>:
*   **Silly mistakes**: This indicates you are not reading questions carefully and need to practice more MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Knowledge gaps**: If you encounter topics you don't know, refer back to your LRR notes to read them superficially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.
A low GT score does not mean you should stop studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>; instead, it is an opportunity to adjust your strategy for the remaining days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.

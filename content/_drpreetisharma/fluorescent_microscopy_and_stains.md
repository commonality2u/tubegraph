[[Microscopes and their types | Fluorescent microscopy]] is a technique used in microbiology, distinct from a [[Microscopes and their types | light microscope]] due to key differences in illumination and specialized staining methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Fluorescent Microscope
A [[Microscopes and their types | fluorescent microscope]] may appear similar to a [[Microscopes and their types | light microscope]] but incorporates additional components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. A distinguishing feature is the presence of [[Microscopes and their types | dichroic mirrors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Principle of Operation
*   **Light Source** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>: [[Microscopes and their types | Fluorescent microscopes]] utilize ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Wavelength Conversion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>: Dichroic mirrors convert short wavelengths of light into longer wavelengths, a concept that has been a past examination question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Fluorescent Stains
Fluorescent stains are crucial for [[Microscopy and image identification techniques | image identification]] and are linked to specific pathogens and conditions.

### Examples of Fluorescent Stains
*   **For Tuberculosis (TB)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>: Auramine-Rhodamine stain (Ora Man and Roda Man Stain) is used for [[Bacterial and fungal diagnostics | Mycobacterial TB]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This stain is very important for TB diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   *Note*: Rhodanine is a different stain used for copper, relevant to [[Bacterial and fungal diagnostics | Wilson's Disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **For Malaria** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>: Acridine orange is the fluorescent stain used for malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **For Fungus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>: Calcofluor White is the fluorescent stain for fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Other Important Stains Mentioned (Non-Fluorescent)
While not fluorescent, other stains were discussed in the context of [[Microscopy and image identification techniques | image identification]] and [[Bacterial staining techniques and their significance | bacterial staining techniques]]:

*   **India Ink** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>: A [[bacterial_staining_techniques_and_their_significance | negative stain]] used for Cryptococcal meningitis from Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) samples obtained via lumbar puncture in live patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   **Mucicarmine Stain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>: Used for Cryptococcal meningitis in brain biopsy or autopsy samples from deceased patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. It results in a pinkish-red stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   **Lactophenol Cotton Blue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>: A stain for [[Fungal Staining Techniques | fungi]], resulting in a blue color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) Stain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>: The primary stain for [[Bacterial and fungal diagnostics | Mycobacterial TB]], classifying it as an acid-fast bacillus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Dienes Stain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>: Used for [[Bacterial and fungal diagnostics | Mycoplasma]], which is a very small bacterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.
*   **Warthin-Starry Silver Stain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>: Used for *H. pylori* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.
*   **Albert Stain (Tim Tim)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>: Used for [[Bacterial and fungal diagnostics | Corynebacterium diphtheriae]], composed of Toluidine blue, Iodine, and Malachite green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. The bacteria appear malachite green, and Volutin granules appear bluish-purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
*   **Loeffler Methylene Blue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>: Considered the best stain for Volutin granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.
*   **Jaswant Singh-Bhattacharya Stain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>: Used for identifying different stages of malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>.
*   **Flox Tartrate Stain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a>: Used for [[Bacterial and fungal diagnostics | Henderson-Patterson bodies]] (HP bodies) found in Molluscum contagiosum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>.

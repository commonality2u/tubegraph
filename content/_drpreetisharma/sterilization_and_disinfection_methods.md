Sterilization and disinfection are crucial aspects of microbiology, particularly for medical aspirants preparing for exams like FMG and NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article discusses various [[physical_and_chemical_methods_of_sterilization | physical and chemical methods]] used for these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## Physical Methods
[[physical_and_chemical_methods_of_sterilization | Physical methods]] of sterilization primarily include heat, [[radiation_and_filtration_in_microbiology | radiation]], and [[radiation_and_filtration_in_microbiology | filtration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

### Heat Sterilization
Heat is a highly effective physical method of sterilization, categorized into dry heat and moist heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

#### Dry Heat Sterilization
Dry heat sterilization does not involve fumes or steam, relying on pure simple heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

##### Hot Air Oven
A hot air oven is a typical oven used for sterilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Usage**: It is used for sterilizing glassware (flasks, test tubes), syringes, cotton swabs, and greasy materials like liquid paraffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **Protocol**: The usual protocol is 160°C for two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, but it can also be 160°C for two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
*   **Control**: The efficiency of a hot air oven is checked using spores of *Bacillus subtilis* (also known as *Bacillus atrophaeus*) or *Clostridium tetani* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. If both *Bacillus* and *Clostridium* are options, *Bacillus* species are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

##### Incineration
Incineration plants in hospitals are used for disposing of hospital waste, animal waste, and human body parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
*   **Temperature**: This process occurs at a high temperature of 1100-1200°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

#### Moist Heat Sterilization
Moist heat sterilization involves different temperature ranges and techniques.

##### Below 100°C
*   **Inspissation**: This method is used for sterilizing media like Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media (for [[infectious_diseases_and_treatments | tuberculosis]]) and Loeffler's Serum Slope (LSS) (for *Corynebacterium*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. The process involves heating to 80°C for 30 minutes, repeated for three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.
*   **Pasteurization**: Primarily used for milk sterilization, pasteurization has two methods, both below 100°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.
    *   **Holder Method**: 63°C for 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.
    *   **Flash Method**: 72°C for 20 seconds, followed by cooling to 13°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. The flash method is considered better as it can kill *Coxiella*, which the holder method cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

##### At 100°C
*   **Boiling**: Simple boiling of water for 15-20 minutes can kill bacteria, but it does not kill spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Tyndallization**: This technique aims to kill spores by repeating the boiling cycle. It involves heating to 100°C for 20 minutes, repeated for three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

##### Above 100°C
*   **Autoclave**: This is a widely used method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
    *   **Protocol**: Standard autoclaving is at 121°C for 15 minutes at 15 PSI (pounds per square inch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
    *   **Usage**: Used for sterilizing [[microbial_culture_techniques | culture media]], instruments, aprons, most sutures (except catgut), and [[microbiological_techniques_for_transporting_and_growing_cultures | sputum samples]] before discarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.
    *   **Exceptions**: Catgut sutures are not autoclaved because they lose strength and elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. LJ media and LSS media are also not autoclaved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
    *   **Control**: The control for autoclaving is *Bacillus stearothermophilus*, which indicates if the temperature of 121°C has been attained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
    *   **Prion Killing**: For killing prions, the temperature is increased to 134°C for 1.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.

### Radiation Sterilization
[[radiation_and_filtration_in_microbiology | Radiation]] methods are categorized into ionizing and non-ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

#### Ionizing Radiation (Cold Sterilization)
*   **Types**: X-rays and gamma rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.
*   **Effect**: They do not increase the temperature, hence called "cold sterilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.
*   **Usage**: Used for sterilizing catgut sutures (which cannot be autoclaved), pre-packed syringes, and grafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

#### Non-Ionizing Radiation (Hot Sterilization)
*   **Types**: Ultraviolet (UV) rays and infrared (IR) rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.
*   **Effect**: They increase the temperature, hence called "hot sterilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
*   **Usage**: Used for OT (Operating Theater) fumigation and sterilizing biosafety cabinets (using UV light) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>.
*   **Control for Radiation (general)**: The control for radiation sterilization is *Bacillus pumilus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

### Filtration
[[radiation_and_filtration_in_microbiology | Filtration]] is used to filter liquids and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.
*   **Types of Filters**: HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters are common in air purifiers, while alpha filters are considered the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. Earlier, Seitz filters were used, but they contained carcinogenic asbestos and are no longer in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.
*   **Pore Size**: The pore size of these filters is 0.22 microns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.
*   **Control**: The control organism for filtration is *Brevundimonas diminuta* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

## Chemical Methods
[[physical_and_chemical_methods_of_sterilization | Chemical methods]] utilize various chemical agents for disinfection and sterilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

### Alcohols and Aldehydes
#### Alcohols
*   **Isopropyl Alcohol**: Commonly used at 70-80% concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. It is preferred for sterilizing stethoscopes and thermometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

#### Aldehydes
*   **Glutaraldehyde (Cidex)**: Used for all "scopes" such as bronchoscopes, laryngoscopes, endoscopes, proctoscopes, and colonoscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.
*   **Formaldehyde**:
    *   **Liquid Formalin**: Used for preserving pathology specimens and cadavers in anatomy labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.
    *   **Formaldehyde Gas**: Used for OT fumigation <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

### Phenols
Phenols include disinfectants like Lysol (floor disinfectant), Savlon, and Dettol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. They are used for cleaning sharp instruments and floors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>.

### Halogens

    *   **Sodium Hypochlorite**: A 1% solution is considered the most potent disinfectant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. It is used to disinfect blood spills on floors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>. Older recommendations for sodium hypochlorite were 10%, but current recommendations are 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.

### Gaseous Sterilization (Ethylene Oxide)
*   **Ethylene Oxide (ETO)**: Used at 3% concentration, diluted with other gases like nitrogen, because 100% ETO is inflammable and carcinogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.
*   **Usage**: Primarily used for sterilizing cardiopulmonary machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.
*   **Control**: The control for gas sterilization is *Bacillus globigii* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

### Plasma Sterilization
Plasma is considered the fourth state of matter (after solid, liquid, gas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) can be used to create plasma for sterilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
*   **Control**: The control for plasma sterilization is *Bacillus stearothermophilus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>.

## Testing Disinfectants
To assess the efficacy and reusability of a disinfectant, several tests are performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

### Phenol Coefficient Test (Rideal-Walker Test)
This test compares the unknown disinfectant solution with phenol to determine its efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>. A drawback is that it only compares against phenol and doesn't account for killing fungus, soil organisms, or organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

### Modified Rideal-Walker Test (Chick-Martin Test)
This is a modification of the Rideal-Walker test. It tests the disinfectant's ability to kill organisms in the presence of organic matter like soil, yeast, [[fungal_staining_techniques | fungus]], or spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>.

### Capacity Test (Kelsey-Sykes Test)
This test determines the reusability or "capacity" of a disinfectant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

### In-Use Test (Kelsey-Modder Test)
This test assesses the practical effectiveness of the disinfectant when used in a clinical setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.

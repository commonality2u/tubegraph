## Introduction to Spindle Cells and Mesenchyme Tumors

When discussing [[Differential diagnosis in pathology | pathology]], the term "spindle cells" refers to cells that appear tall and elongated, or "tall pulled" [00:20:51]. These cells are indicative of a mesenchymal origin, as opposed to an epithelial one [00:21:18].

## Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)

[[Pathogenesis and Markers of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors | Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor]] (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor found in the stomach [00:21:21], though it can also occur in the intestines [00:21:49].

### Characteristics

GIST often presents as a firm, smooth, yellowish submucosal ulcerated mass [00:20:31]. Microscopically, these tumors are characterized by the presence of spindle cells [00:20:38].

### Origin

GIST arises from the cells of Cajal, which are the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [00:22:10].

### Genetic Alterations and Markers

The formation of GIST involves specific genetic mutations [00:22:29].
*   The most common mutation associated with GIST is **CD117** (also known as c-Kit) [00:22:31].
*   Less common mutations include **PDGFR** (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor) [00:22:48] and **Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH)** deficiency, which is particularly seen in pediatric GIST cases [00:22:56].
*   The sensitive marker for GIST is **CD117** [00:23:19].
*   A specific marker for GIST is **DOG1** [00:23:29].
*   Another CD marker that can be positive in GIST is **CD34** [00:23:43]. CD34 is also associated with endothelial cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and solid fibrocystic tumors [00:24:05].

### Diagnosis
The presence of spindle cells in a biopsy, particularly from the stomach, strongly suggests [[Pathogenesis and Markers of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors | GIST]] [00:20:56]. Further confirmation involves identifying specific genetic mutations like CD117 [00:22:31].

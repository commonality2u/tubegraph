The final days leading up to an exam are crucial and often referred to as "make or break" period for students preparing for the FMG January 20th exam. While significant time has been spent on classes, Q-banks, and previous year questions, the strategy for these last 10 days can make all the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This guide outlines key [[dos_and_donts_in_the_final_exam_preparation_phase | do's and don'ts]] for this critical period.

## General Guidance for the Final Days

### Addressing Unfinished Syllabus
It's common for students not to have completed all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Instead of panicking, make a list of completed and remaining subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

*   **Avoid "New" Content in Studied Subjects**: Do not start studying rare or entirely new topics within subjects you have already covered, like pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   **Do Not Leave Any Subject Completely Untouched**: You don't need a PhD in every subject, but you must know a little bit about all 19 subjects to attempt at least 50% of questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>.
    *   For unstudied subjects like orthopedics, anesthesia, or forensics, focus on 3-hour long Last Minute Revision (LRR) sessions or crash courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### Sleep Cycle Normalization
*   **Prioritize Sleep**: Begin normalizing your sleep cycle to be alert during the actual exam hours (morning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Aim for a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Avoid sleepless nights or experimenting with new medications for sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) and Mock Exams
The decision to take a Grand Test in the last 9-10 days is personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Managing Pressure**: If scoring below 150 in a GT causes panic and anxiety, it might be better to avoid taking them in the final days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **Focus, Not Score**: If you do take a GT, concentrate solely on [[time_management_and_exam_anxiety | time management]] and identifying silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>. The score is not the primary concern at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16:00">[51:16:00]</a>.
*   **MCQs are Essential**: Regardless of GTs, continue practicing MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
    *   For correct MCQs, do not read explanations. For incorrect ones, superficially review the explanation to understand if it was a silly mistake or knowledge gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Don't deep dive into topics for wrong answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
    *   Be aware that exams will contain 20-30 "bouncer" questions that appear new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. Don't let these demotivate you; your passing score is determined by known topics and avoiding silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

### Managing Anxiety and Negativity
*   **Embrace Positivity**: Surround yourself with positive influences like family, good friends, and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Negative Influences**: Steer clear of individuals who boast about their preparations (e.g., "10 revisions, 250 in GT") or spread rumors about exam difficulty or pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   **Block Unnecessary Thoughts**: Do not dwell on future anxieties like alarm clocks, reaching the exam center, or computer functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>. One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>.
*   **Competitive Mindset**: Success in competitive exams depends not just on knowledge but also on mindset and mental stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.

## Subject Management and Daily Schedule

### Subject Prioritization
*   **Short Subjects**: Allocate roughly 2.5 days for short subjects (ENT, Eye, Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, Dermatology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. Focus on LRR sessions and previous year questions for these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects (Giants)**: For subjects like Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM, which are difficult to retain, dedicate additional time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. Again, concentrate on LRR and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. Accept that no one remembers these subjects perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Subjects**: Remaining days should be allocated to clinical subjects like Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, Pathology, and Physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. Similar to others, focus on LRR videos and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

### Daily Time Management
Divide each day into four time slots for effective study:
1.  **Study (Theory & MCQs)**: This will take up the majority of your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Study Hours**: Aim for a minimum of 12-14 *productive* hours of study daily, meaning full concentration without distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. If you can complete your daily targets in fewer hours (e.g., 8-9 hours) because you are a fast reader, that's an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Theory vs. MCQs**: Allocate approximately 40% of your study time to theory (using LRR PDFs) and 60% to MCQs, as MCQ explanations also cover theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Daily MCQs**: Aim for at least 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. Some high-scoring students have reported doing 300+ daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:34:00">[34:34:00]</a>. If currently doing fewer, gradually increase by 10-15 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Question Type**: Focus on MCQs related to previous year *topics* rather than just memorizing previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>. Use question banks to solve all MCQs for important topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Images**: Dedicate 1 hour daily to reviewing images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. Quickly scan through images of subjects covered that day before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.
3.  **Sanity Break**: Allocate 30 minutes daily for personal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Activity**: Engage in outdoor activities like a light walk, or simply take a break from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. This helps prevent mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. Keep phone use to a minimum during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

## Last-Minute Revisions and Exam Day Mindset

### [[Lastminute exam checklist | Last-Minute Exam Checklist]]
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**: Must complete at least 5 years of FMG PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>. If time permits, review 3 years of NEET PG recall sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>, and then the IAI CET November paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects**: For subjects like Pharmacology and Microbiology, which are often forgotten, focus on LRR and PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>. Treat these as "survival" tasks; you don't need to enjoy studying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>.
*   **Flashback Sessions**: If struggling to revise on your own, consider watching recorded "flashback" sessions on YouTube that cover previous year questions for all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>. Listening at 2x speed can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>.
*   **Final Day Revision**: Focus on LRR and PYQs only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>. Revise volatile subjects (like Biochemistry cycles, Microbiology catalysts, Anatomy nerve supplies, Pharmacology drugs, PSM schemes and biostatistics) that you tend to forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:54:00">[43:54:00]</a>.

### [[Exam day strategy and mindset | Exam Day Strategy and Mindset]]
*   **Paper Difficulty**: Expect one paper to be tough and the other easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[39:48:00]</a>. Don't let a difficult Paper 1 demotivate you; disconnect from it during the break and focus on Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>. Your overall passing score of 150 will be a combination of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27:00">[41:27:00]</a>.
*   **Sustained Focus**: The Pomodoro technique is not suitable for these final days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>. Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch without distractions to build exam endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:29:00">[53:29:00]</a>.
*   **Break Down Tasks**: Work in short, manageable boxes (e.g., "what to study for the next three hours") rather than overthinking the entire 9-day period or future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:18:00">[54:18:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Success Mindset
> For students consistently scoring 170-190+ in Grand Tests, continue with your current strategy. It is working for you; do not doubt yourself or change course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:22:00">[37:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:29:00">[38:29:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The final days are about survival and optimization. Focus on what you can do *now* to maximize your chances of crossing the 150+ score threshold. Keep studying, stay positive, and manage your time effectively.

The class schedule, traditionally held on Wednesdays, is undergoing changes due to the speaker's commitments outside Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While classes will continue, they will shift to different days, potentially Tuesdays or Thursdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A detailed list of classes until the first half of April has been prepared and will be updated regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Current and Upcoming Class Schedule

*   **Today's Class:** 15 questions on parasitic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Next Class (March 26th):** Virology Quiz on Tuesday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:58">[01:26:58]</a>. This will not be on a Wednesday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>.
*   **April 7th, 8th, 10th:** [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | INI CET]] LRR (Last Revision) for Pathology and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These sessions will be on the PrepLadder YouTube channel at 12 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. They will cover specific requested topics in Path and Micro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, including specialized areas often procrastinated like flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, bacterial genetics, and culture media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>.
*   **April 16th:** General Path Mega Quiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This quiz will cover four chapters: cell injury, inflammation, genetics, and neoplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Separate Immunology Class:** Immunology will be a dedicated session before [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | INI CET]] due to multiple requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.

Most classes will maintain the usual 11 AM time, with the exception of the PrepLadder LRR sessions which will be at 12 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Additional Study Initiatives

To support [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | exam preparation]], several new initiatives are being launched, primarily starting April 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Daily Telegram Quiz
The daily Telegram quiz will increase from 5 questions to approximately 7-10 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. These quizzes will include audio descriptions and daily topic-wise descriptions, posted as messages on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Short Topic Videos
The speaker plans to give short topics from main videos daily for about 15 days, helping students cover essential content without watching entire lengthy videos. Specific timestamps will be provided to focus on relevant sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Drug of Choice Diaries
This initiative will feature daily Telegram flashcards and quizzes focusing on "Drug of Choice" for pharmacology, starting April 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. The goal is to finish all drug of choice topics within 20 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Pathology Stains Series
A new "A to Z" series on pathology stains will be introduced. Stains will be arranged alphabetically and discussed in 30-second clips, potentially on alternate days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Future Plans

The current phase of "ultra rapid revision" involves one class per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. After [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | INI CET]], the classes will move into "Phase 2," which will be more intensive, possibly two classes per week, and will cover more content per session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The series will continue until the [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | NEET PG]] exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The speaker aims to complete Hematology before May 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:55">[01:24:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE] NEET PG and FMGE exams are becoming "massively overlapping" in terms of topics, while [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | INI CET]] still has a separate set of topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

All class links, timings, and channels will be posted on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Students are encouraged to use existing Q Banks for practice, as micro-biology is an in-depth topic where 85% is covered by videos and the remaining 15% needs to be covered through Q Banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
Students should keep track of their scores in quizzes to monitor improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a> and manage time effectively during challenging questions, allocating more time if needed, as easier questions can be solved quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. The minimum requirement for [[daily_study_targets_and_time_management | NEET PG]] preparation is to cover five years of past papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>.

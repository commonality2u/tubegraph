Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a significant topic in [[renal_system_and_pathology | renal system pathology]] and is often discussed alongside genital system pathology [00:00:49]-[00:00:51].

## Clinical Diagnosis of Renal Cell Carcinoma

Typical clinical presentation for suspected RCC includes a 35-year-old patient presenting with right flank pain and blood in the urine (hematuria) for three weeks [00:01:34]-[00:01:42]. A flank mass may be palpable on the right side of the abdomen [00:01:46]-[00:01:48]. Imaging such as CCT (Contrast-Enhanced CT) often reveals a tumor mass [00:01:48]-[00:01:51], leading to a nephrectomy [00:01:53]. These symptoms are classic indicators of RCC [00:02:24]-[00:02:30].

## Pathology of Renal Cell Carcinoma

Histological examination is crucial for classifying RCC and identifying specific genetic alterations.

### Types of Renal Cell Carcinoma

#### 1. Clear Cell RCC (CCC)
*   **Prevalence**: It is the most common type of RCC [00:05:04].
*   **Histology**: Characterized by "empty clear cells," appearing "white white empty empty clear clear" [00:05:09]-[00:05:12], [00:05:43]-[00:05:56].
*   **Genetics**: Associated with a deletion on chromosome 3p [00:05:15]-[00:05:17].
*   **Syndrome**: Frequently linked to VHL syndrome (Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome) [00:05:19]-[00:05:32].

#### 2. Papillary RCC
*   **Histology**: Shows tall cells arranged in papillae [00:01:55]-[00:01:58], [00:02:37]-[00:02:42]. A key feature is the presence of psammoma bodies [00:06:17]-[00:06:24].
*   **Genetics**: Often involves Trisomy 7 and 17 [00:02:48]-[00:02:51], [00:07:16]-[00:07:21].
*   **Associated Conditions**:
    *   Patients on dialysis are at risk of papillary RCC [00:06:51]-[00:07:04].
    *   Loss of the Y chromosome is associated with papillary RCC [00:07:08]-[00:07:11].
    *   Fumarate hydratase gene (FH gene) mutation leads to hereditary leiomyomatosis and papillary RCC (HLRCC), characterized by numerous leiomyomas (fibroids) along with papillary RCC [00:07:33]-[00:08:27].

#### 3. Chromophobe RCC
*   **Genetics**: Known for multiple chromosomal losses (e.g., chromosome 1, 5, 7, 10, 13) [00:10:31]-[00:10:55], hence "chromophobe" (fear of chromosomes).
*   **Associated Syndrome**: Associated with Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome [00:11:05]-[00:11:11], which can include skin appendage tumors like fibrofolliculomas [00:11:17]-[00:11:36].
*   **Histology**: Described as a "vegetarian tumor" that "loves plants" [00:11:42]-[00:11:48], showing "plant cells" with distinct outlines like leaf cells [00:11:48]-[00:12:29]. Features include a dark, "raisinoid nucleus" and a "perinuclear halo" (empty area around the nucleus) [00:12:32]-[00:13:28].
*   **Stain**: Can be stained with Hale's Colloidal Iron, which appears blue [00:13:31]-[00:13:40].

#### 4. Collecting Duct (Bellini Duct) RCC
*   **Prognosis**: Has the worst prognosis among RCC types [00:14:13]-[00:14:24].
*   **Origin**: Arises from the collecting ducts [00:14:49]-[00:14:55].

#### 5. Medullary RCC
*   **Association**: Most commonly associated with sickle cell trait, not sickle cell anemia [00:15:00]-[00:15:16], [00:16:37]-[00:16:43]. A common genotype for sickle cell trait is HbAS [00:16:50]-[00:17:08].

#### 6. Pediatric RCC (Xp11 Translocation RCC)
*   **Patient Age**: Can occur in children, but also in adults (e.g., an 82-year-old patient) [00:03:06]-[00:04:07], [00:04:38]-[00:04:42], [00:15:39]-[00:16:05]. Age is not the sole deciding factor for diagnosis [00:04:29]-[00:04:34], [00:16:06]-[00:16:08].
*   **Genetics**: Involves Xp11 translocation [00:03:21]-[00:03:24], affecting the TFE3 gene [00:03:46]-[00:03:51], [00:15:45]-[00:15:51].

## Other Kidney Tumors and Related Conditions

#### Renal Oncocytoma
*   **Nature**: A benign renal tumor [00:20:14]-[00:20:18].
*   **Histology**: Characterized by oncocytes, cells very rich in mitochondria [00:20:21]-[00:20:40].
*   **Gross Appearance**: Presents with a mahogany brown color [00:21:01]-[00:21:09].
*   **Classic Feature**: Often shows a central stellate scar [00:21:12]-[00:21:16].

#### Angiomyolipoma (AML) of the Kidney
*   **Association**: Associated with tuberous sclerosis, along with cardiac rhabdomyoma [00:17:46]-[00:18:15], [00:18:53]-[00:19:00].
*   **Composition**: Contains blood vessels (angio), muscle (myo), and fat (lipo) [00:18:32]-[00:18:42].
*   **Histology**: Rhabdomyomas (cardiac tumors in tuberous sclerosis) show spider cells [00:19:02]-[00:19:17].

## [[diabetic_nephropathy_and_related_renal_pathology | Diabetic Nephropathy]]

*   **Electron Microscopy**: Shows rupture and wrinkling of the glomerular basement membrane [00:39:33]-[00:40:45].

## Immunofluorescence and Electron Microscopy in Kidney Pathology

Interpreting immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM) images is essential in [[kidney_pathology | kidney pathology]]:

*   **Subepithelial Deposits (outside epithelium/feet/podocytes):**
    *   **PSGN (Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis)**: Seen in children [00:42:51]-[00:43:04]. IF shows a "starry sky appearance" [00:47:37]-[00:47:43], and EM shows large subepithelial humps [00:47:47]-[00:48:43].
    *   **Membranous Glomerulonephropathy (MGN)**: Seen in elderly patients [00:43:09]-[00:43:15]. EM shows "spike and dome" pattern due to subepithelial immune complex deposits (domes) with spikes of basement membrane [00:56:05]-[00:58:29].

*   **Mesangial Deposits (middle part - mesangium):**
    *   **Berger's Disease (IgA Nephropathy)**: IgA deposits are seen in the mesangium [00:43:56]-[00:44:07], [00:50:06]-[00:50:12]. IF might show a "loopy" or irregular green deposition pattern [00:49:08]-[00:50:06].

*   **Intramembranous Deposits (within basement membrane):**
    *   **Dense Deposit Disease (DDD)**: Also known as MPGN Type 2 [00:44:38]-[00:44:53], [00:59:47]-[00:59:58]. EM shows a very dense, thick black line within the basement membrane [01:00:01]-[01:00:28].

*   **Subendothelial Deposits (inside epithelium/capillary endothelium):**
    *   **MPGN Type 1 (Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis Type 1)**: EM shows a "tram track appearance" or "railway track appearance" due to duplication of the basement membrane [00:58:48]-[00:59:44].
    *   **Lupus Nephritis**: Can present with "wire loop lesions" [00:45:09]-[00:45:17]. Class IV lupus nephritis most commonly shows these loop lesions [00:46:26]-[00:46:47].

*   **Other Morphological Changes:**
    *   **Alport Syndrome**: A nephritic syndrome with kidney, eye (anterior lenticonus), and ear (sensorineural hearing loss) problems [00:52:51]-[00:53:20]. EM shows a "basket weave appearance" of the glomerular basement membrane due to holes and fragmentation [00:52:37]-[00:52:47]. Caused by a defect in collagen Type IV, most commonly the alpha-5 chain [00:53:35]-[00:54:16].
    *   **Minimal Change Disease**: A nephrotic syndrome [00:55:00]-[00:55:03]. EM shows effacement (flattening) of podocyte foot processes [00:54:56]-[00:55:00].

## Genital System Pathology - Ovarian Tumors

Ovarian tumors are categorized based on their cellular origin and features.

### Surface Epithelial Tumors
These are grouped together due to common tumor markers and some shared characteristics. CA-125 is a common tumor marker for surface epithelial ovarian tumors [01:07:17]-[01:07:25].

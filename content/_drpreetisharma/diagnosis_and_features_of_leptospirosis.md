Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria from the *Leptospira* genus. The disease presents with a range of symptoms and has distinct diagnostic features.

## Clinical Presentation
A patient with Leptospirosis may present with symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches, often accompanied by mild vomiting and diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Etiology and Transmission
Leptospirosis is caused by bacteria belonging to the [[Spirochetes and their diagnostics | spirochete]] family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The *Leptospira* bacteria are characterized by their spiral shape and distinct hooked ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A mnemonic to remember their shape is "lepeta who are spiral," which refers to their hooked ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The infection is typically contracted when rat urine contaminates rainy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This contaminated water can then come into contact with individuals, especially those working in rice or paddy fields, where the crop requires significant water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Farmers are therefore at a higher risk of contracting the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The disease caused by *Leptospira* is also known as Weil's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The "four Rs" associated with Leptospirosis are: rat (urine), rainy water, rice field workers, and "dinger's ring" on culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Leptospirosis involves various investigations, including culture testing and serological investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Microscopic Features
Microscopically, *Leptospira* appear as spiral organisms with hooked ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Culture
When cultured, *Leptospira* can produce a characteristic "dinger's ring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This ring is obtained on EMJH media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Serological Testing
Serological tests are performed to detect antibodies against *Leptospira* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Common serological [[Parasitology quiz and diagnostic techniques | diagnostic techniques]] include the cold agglutination test, standard agglutination test, and microscopic agglutination test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The microscopic agglutination test is particularly relevant for Leptospirosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

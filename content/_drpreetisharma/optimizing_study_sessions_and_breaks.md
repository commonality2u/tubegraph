Preparing for the FMGE exam requires a structured approach to [[time_management_for_exam_studies | time management]], focusing on optimizing study sessions and incorporating effective breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Dr. Preeti Sharma emphasizes the importance of a well-planned daily routine to maintain consistency and maximize learning during the 60-day study period leading up to the December 2024 FMGE exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Daily Study Hour Requirements

For successful preparation, an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day is necessary to cover the syllabus within 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Without meeting this target, it will be challenging to complete the syllabus and subsequently undergo the three recommended revision cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The key to cracking this exam is the number of revisions and daily MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## The Concept of Time Boxing

To effectively manage study hours and prevent burnout, implement "time boxing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This involves clearly dividing your day into dedicated study times, break times, and "chill" times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This structured approach helps in adhering to the 10-hour study schedule while providing adequate rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

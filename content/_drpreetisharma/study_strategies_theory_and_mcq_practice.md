Successful preparation for the FMG exam requires a well-structured plan that balances theory and multiple-choice question (MCQ) practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This guide outlines a 60-day study strategy designed for the December 2024 FMG exam, applicable whether you are a first-time test-taker or aiming to improve on a previous score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Overall Exam Preparation Strategy

The key to cracking the exam lies in the number of revisions and the consistent practice of MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. A 60-day timetable focusing on covering the syllabus, followed by a dedicated revision plan, is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The suggested 60-day timetable runs from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Following this, a revision plan consisting of three phases (45 days, 5 days, and 15 days) will be introduced, aiming for completion around December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Daily Study Targets

*   **Study Hours:** Aim for 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is necessary to cover the syllabus within the 60-day timeframe and enable multiple revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **MCQs:** Practice 100 to 120 MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. If you are new to practicing MCQs, gradually increase your daily count by 15 to 20 questions until you reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Theory Study Approach

### Single Source per Subject
It is highly recommended to stick to a single source for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Choose a faculty or notes that you understand best, and use that as your primary resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision
The choice between main videos and rapid revision depends on your proficiency in a subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>:
*   **Rapid Revision:** Use for subjects where you consistently score above 80% in your Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Main Videos:** For subjects or topics where your Q-bank score is below 80%, indicating weaker areas, refer to main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This personalized approach allows you to focus on your weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Subject-Specific Recommendations
For [[microbiology_study_techniques_for_exams | Pathology]] and [[microbiology_study_techniques_for_exams | Microbiology]], it is advised to use rapid revision videos only, rather than the main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Specifically, for [[microbiology_study_techniques_for_exams | Pathology]], the rapid revision is approximately 19 hours, and for [[microbiology_study_techniques_for_exams | Microbiology]], it is 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Watching videos at 1.5x to 1.75x speed (or even 2x for [[microbiology_study_techniques_for_exams | Pathology]]) can help cover the content efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Integrated Subject Blocks
The syllabus is divided into four integrated blocks to facilitate better understanding and integration of concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>:

1.  **Block 1:**
    *   Anatomy: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
    *   Surgery: 6 days (integrated with Anatomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
    *   Orthopedics: 2 days (integrated with Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
    *   Radiology: 2 days (to wrap up concepts from Surgery and Orthopedics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>

2.  **Block 2:**
    *   [[microbiology_study_techniques_for_exams | Pathology]]: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
    *   [[microbiology_study_techniques_for_exams | Microbiology]]: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
    *   Pharmacology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
    *   Medicine: 6 days (these basic sciences strengthen your foundation for Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
    *   Pediatrics: 2 days (overlaps with Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
    *   Physiology: 1 day (focus on extra physiologies if already covered with Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
    *   Dermatology: 1 day (correlates with [[microbiology_study_techniques_for_exams | Pathology]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

3.  **Block 3:**
    *   OBGYN: 6 days (a must) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
    *   Anesthesia: 2 days (wraps up with surgical branches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>

4.  **Block 4 (Standalone Subjects):**
    *   PSM: 5 days (more time allocated due to increasing difficulty of questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
    *   Biochemistry: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
    *   ENT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
    *   Ophthalmology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
    *   FMT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
    *   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

## MCQ Practice Approach

### Daily Targets
As mentioned, 100-120 MCQs are to be done daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Custom Modules
Before bed, dedicate about 30 minutes to a "casual test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Create a custom module of 30 questions from all the subjects you have covered up to that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This helps you stay in touch with previously studied subjects and avoids forgetting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Do not write or bookmark anything; simply understand why you got questions wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Reviewing Grand Tests
In the 60-day plan, two full days are allocated for Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. A GT day means not only taking the test but also reviewing it thoroughly on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Even if you haven't finished all 19 subjects, take GT1 (e.g., September 8th) after covering approximately 15 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. GT2 is scheduled for September 21st, marking the end of the 60-day timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule (Timeboxing)

Timeboxing is key to managing your study hours effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This proposed schedule allows for 10 hours of study with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>:

*   **Morning Routine (1 hour):** Wake up and enjoy your morning, perhaps including 20 minutes of outdoor activity for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM):** 3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This block trains you to sit for long stretches, similar to exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Short Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM):** 30 minutes. Relax, close your eyes, listen to music, or talk to family/friends. Avoid screens during this time to prevent eye strain and getting stuck in social media loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM):** 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. By lunchtime, you will have completed 5.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM):** 1.5 hours. This includes lunch (around 30 minutes) and dedicated relaxation time. You can take a power nap or engage with social media/entertainment during this longer break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM):** 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Evening Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM):** 1 hour. A mixture of a short mental break and time to talk to friends, discuss studies, or use social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM):** 2 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. The session duration decreases as you get tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Casual MCQ Practice (9:00 PM onwards):** Custom module of 30 questions from covered subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Wind Down (until 11:00-11:30 PM):** Chill, watch social media, or a web series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep, waking up by 7:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

This schedule can be adjusted for night owls but the structure of timeboxing and breaks should be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Maintain consistency and vigilance throughout this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Embrace this testing time with humility, as tough times often lead to greater heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

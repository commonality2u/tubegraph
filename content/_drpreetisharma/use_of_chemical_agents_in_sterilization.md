Chemical methods are one of the primary approaches used for [[sterilization_methods | sterilization and disinfection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. These methods involve the use of various chemical agents, such as alcohols, aldehydes, phenols, halogens, and gaseous materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

## Alcohols and Aldehydes

### Alcohols
The most important alcohol used is isopropyl alcohol, typically at a concentration of 70-80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>. It is commonly used for sterilizing stethoscopes and thermometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

### Aldehydes
Two main types of aldehydes are utilized: formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.

*   **Glutaraldehyde (Cidex)**: This solution is famously known as Cidex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. It is used for sterilizing all types of 'scopes' such as bronchoscopes, laryngoscopes, endoscopes, proctoscopes, and colonoscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. Glutaraldehyde is *not* used for thermometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>.
*   **Formaldehyde**:
    *   **Liquid Formalin**: Used for preserving pathology specimens and cadavers in anatomy labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. The burning sensation experienced in these labs is often due to the presence of formalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.
    *   **Formaldehyde Gas**: Used for Operation Theater (OT) fumigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

## Phenols and Halogens

### Phenols
Phenols include common [[disinfection_techniques | disinfectants]] like Lysol, Savlon, and Dettol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. They are used for cleaning sharp instruments and floors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.

### Halogens
Halogens commonly used for [[disinfection_techniques | disinfection]] include iodine (e.g., Tincture Iodine, Betadine) and chloride (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.

*   **Sodium Hypochlorite**: Considered the most potent disinfectant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Current recommendations suggest using it at a 1% concentration, not the previously recommended 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>. It is used for cleaning up blood spills on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

## Gaseous Sterilization

### Ethylene Oxide (EtO)
Ethylene Oxide (EtO) is a gaseous agent used for sterilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. It should never be used at 100% concentration as it is inflammable and carcinogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. Latest recommendations suggest using it at a 3% concentration, mixed with other gases like nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. EtO is used for the sterilization of cardiopulmonary machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.

## Plasma Sterilization
Plasma is considered the fourth state of matter, after solid, liquid, and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. Plasma sterilization is achieved by converting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.

## Controls for Sterilization Methods
For quality control and to ensure the effectiveness of [[microbiological_techniques_and_tests | microbiological techniques and tests]], specific bacterial spores are used as controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

*   **Hot Air Oven (Dry Heat)**: *Bacillus subtilis* (also known as *Bacillus atrophaeus*) or *Clostridium tetani* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>. *Bacillus* species are preferred if both are mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **Autoclave (Moist Heat)**: *Bacillus stearothermophilus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.
*   **Radiation**: *Bacillus pumilus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.
*   **Filtration**: *Brevundimonas diminuta* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Gas Sterilization (Ethylene Oxide)**: *Bacillus globi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.
*   **Plasma Sterilization**: *Bacillus stearothermophilus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

## Testing Disinfectant Efficacy
To determine if a chemical solution is potent and efficient enough for [[sterilization_methods | sterilization and disinfection]], four primary tests are conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>:

1.  **Phenol Coefficient Test / Rideal-Walker Test**: Compares the efficacy of the test solution (Solution X) against phenol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. A limitation is that it only compares against phenol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.
2.  **Modified Rideal-Walker Test / Chick-Martin Test**: A more comprehensive test that evaluates disinfectant efficacy in the presence of organic matter (like soil) and against yeast, fungus, and spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.
3.  **Capacity Test / Kelsey-Sykes Test**: Determines the reusability and capacity of a disinfectant solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.
4.  **In-Use Test / Kelsey-Modder Test**: Assesses the practical efficacy of the disinfectant when it is actually used in a clinical or laboratory setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.

[[Mycology Common fungi and their identification markers | Mycology]], the study of fungi, relies heavily on [[Microbiological and histological examination techniques | staining techniques]] for identification, morphology, and diagnosis. These techniques help visualize fungal structures that are often microscopic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Stains for Culture Morphology

Culture morphology is best studied using Lactophenol Cotton Blue (LPCB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This blue stain is used to observe the morphological characteristics of fungi grown on culture media like Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Other [[Key staining techniques in microbiology | Key Staining Techniques]] for Fungi

Different stains are used depending on the sample type (tissue, CSF, etc.) and the specific fungal structures being observed.

### Gomori Methenamine Silver (GMS) Stain

The GMS stain renders fungal hyphae black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The "silver" in its name is a mnemonic for the black color it imparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

*   **Applications**:
    *   **Blastomycosis**: Shows a classical "figure of eight" appearance due to broad-based budding, stained black by GMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   **Paracoccidioidomycosis**: Displays "mickey mouse" or "mariner wheel" appearance, also stained black by GMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
    *   **[[Diseases caused by specific fungi and their identification | Pneumocystis carinii]] (PCP)**: Stains exclusively with GMS, showing "crushed ping-pong ball" or "cup and saucer" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.

### Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) Stain

PAS stain turns fungal hyphae pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, indicating they are PAS positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Applications**: Useful for general visualization of fungal elements in [[Histology and staining techniques for pinworm diagnosis | tissue sections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. It can highlight features like acute-angled septate hyphae in Aspergillus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>, or broad, aseptate, ribbon-like hyphae in Mucor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

### Calcofluor White

Calcofluor White is a fluorescent dye that stains fungi, making them appear fluorescent against a dark background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It utilizes [[Light and fluorescent microscopy in microbiology | fluorescent microscopy]].

### India Ink Stain

India Ink is a negative stain, meaning it colors the background while leaving the organism unstained, making the capsule visible as a clear halo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Applications**: Primarily used for [[Microbiological techniques and tests | CSF samples]] to identify encapsulated organisms like *Cryptococcus neoformans*, which causes cryptococcal meningitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Mucicarmine Stain

Mucicarmine stains the capsule of *Cryptococcus neoformans* a rose-pink color in biopsy specimens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) Mount

A 10% KOH mount is used for samples containing keratin, such as skin, hair, and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. KOH digests the keratin, making fungal elements easier to visualize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>.
*   **Applications**:
    *   **Tinea versicolor (Malassezia furfur)**: Reveals a "spaghetti and meatball" appearance (yeast cells as meatballs, hyphae as spaghetti) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.
    *   **Chromoblastomycosis**: Shows characteristic brown "copper penny bodies," also known as muriform, medlar, or sclerotic bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

## Other Diagnostic Tests for Fungi

While not staining techniques, these are crucial for fungal identification:

*   **Latex Agglutination Test (LAT)**: A very famous test for the final diagnosis of *Cryptococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Beta-D-Glucan Test**: Detects a normal cell wall component of many fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>. It is positive for many fungal organisms but negative for *Blastomyces*, *Mucor*, and *Cryptococcus* (BMC mnemonic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

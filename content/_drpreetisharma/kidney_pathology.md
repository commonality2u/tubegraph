## Gross Kidney Findings
*   **Waxy Kidney**
    *   This appearance is characteristic of [[Renal system and pathology | amyloidosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.
    *   Confirmation of [[Renal system and pathology | amyloidosis]] involves Congo Red stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, which yields an apple green birefringence under a polarizing microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Putty Kidney (Caseous Necrosis)**
    *   Characterized by [[Renal system and pathology | caseous necrosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.
    *   Often associated with tuberculosis (TB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
    *   Radiologically, calcification can be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.
*   **Leather Grain Kidney**
    *   This appearance, resembling grains, is seen in benign hypertension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

*   **Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate**: Has a "dumbbell" shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
*   **Calcium Oxalate Dihydrate**: Appears as an "envelope" shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Cholesterol Crystals**: Look like "broken chips" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **Uric Acid Crystal**: Can appear in various shapes (round, garbage-like, triangle, diamond) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Often associated with a history of gout and increased uric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.
*   **Triple Phosphate Crystal**: Resembles a "coffin lid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

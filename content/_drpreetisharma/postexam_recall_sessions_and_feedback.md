## Avoiding Discussions Between Exam Papers

It is strongly advised not to engage in discussions or chat with others in between Paper One and Paper Two of an exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Students are often tempted to message others after the first paper, especially regarding subjects they feel confident about, but this should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Why it's Crucial
Engaging in discussions between papers can unnecessarily complicate your preparation for the second paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. If someone mentions a question you might have answered incorrectly or cannot recall, it can negatively impact your mental state and focus for the upcoming paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. For instance, if you learn you got a question wrong, you might enter a negative thought loop, which can impair your performance on the second paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Instead of studying or discussing, focus on light food and drink to maintain energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Engaging with Recall Sessions

Recall sessions are intended for after the entire exam is completed, not in between individual papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. A full "bombshell" of recall sessions typically happens the day after the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

For those looking to engage in post-exam analysis, teachers and experts often participate in these sessions. Even they might find certain "bouncers" or exceptionally difficult questions perplexing, indicating these questions are not designed for anyone to solve and are included to maintain the exam's screening and competitive level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Students should not get discouraged by these challenging questions, as they are a "bouncer for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

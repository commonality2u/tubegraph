Esophageal disorders encompass a range of conditions affecting the esophagus, often presenting with symptoms related to swallowing and digestion. Diagnosis typically involves endoscopy, manometry, and imaging studies like barium swallows, along with microscopic examination of biopsies.

## Achalasia Cardia

Achalasia cardia is characterized by difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and regurgitation of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

### Diagnosis
*   **Endoscopy** typically does not reveal any gastric or esophageal abnormalities, such as cancer, growth, or ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Manometric studies** show a complete absence of peristalsis in the esophagus and a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax upon swallowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Increased LES pressure is also observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Barium swallow** classically reveals a "Bird's Beak Appearance" of the lower esophageal sphincter, due to its failure to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Etiology and Pathophysiology
*   Most cases of achalasia cardia are **idiopathic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Known infectious causes include [[specific_diseases_and_their_presentations_diagnosis_and_treatment | Trypanosoma cruzi]] (leading to Chagas disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   Herpes can also cause achalasia cardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   The condition often results in **megaesophagus** (dilated and very large esophagus) and sometimes megacolon, due to the obstruction and constraint at the lower end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Plummer-Vinson Syndrome

Plummer-Vinson Syndrome, also known as Paterson-Kelly Syndrome, is medically referred to as sideropenic dysphagia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation
*   Typically seen in a young woman with a history of difficulty swallowing and increasing fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Characterized by [[specific_diseases_and_their_presentations_diagnosis_and_treatment | iron deficiency anemia]] (sideropenic anemia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Classical Triad:** Dysphagia, iron deficiency anemia, and esophageal webs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Other miscellaneous features include glossitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Diagnosis
*   Upper endoscopy and GI endoscopy may show enlarged narrowing in the upper third of the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Mucosal biopsy** typically shows no evidence of inflammation or neoplasia, as the esophageal web is just a fold of tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Complications
*   Patients with Plummer-Vinson Syndrome are at an increased risk of developing [[stomach_and_gastrointestinal_tumors | squamous cell carcinoma]] of the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

This article outlines recommended study resources and video lecture strategies for students preparing for NEET PG, particularly focusing on the March 3rd exam. It emphasizes a structured approach to utilizing various materials, balancing detailed study with rapid revision and practical application.

## Daily Targets for Pathology & Microbiology
Daily targets for Pathology (Path) and Microbiology (Micro) will be provided via a G-sheet, structured topic-wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. These targets align with topics listed in [[resources_and_study_materials_for_pathology_residents | Rapid Revision videos]] for Path and Micro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Students should follow these topics from their chosen source, without needing to switch if they are already using another resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This approach helps consolidate knowledge by focusing on specific topics for each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Alternatively, for those who prefer not to dedicate full days to Path and Micro, daily targets can be used to cover these subjects in smaller, consistent chunks (e.g., 40 minutes daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.

## Kickstart Morning Sessions
"Kickstart Morning" sessions are designed to encourage early study habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These sessions will commence after students have completed one full round of [[resources_and_study_materials_for_pathology_residents | Rapid Revision videos]] for Path and Micro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The aim is to first gain foundational knowledge, as starting with these sessions without prior revision could be a [[time_management_and_study_planning_for_exams | waste of time and energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Once initiated, these sessions will primarily involve MCQ-based discussions, which are more effective for integrating knowledge and tackling clinical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Kickstart Morning sessions for Path and Micro will provide updates and quizzes, once foundational revision is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

## Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision (RR) Strategy
The choice between main videos and [[resources_and_study_materials_for_pathology_residents | Rapid Revision (RR)]] videos depends on prior preparation and subject difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### When to use Rapid Revision (RR)
If a student has already covered 85-90% of the syllabus at least once, [[resources_and_study_materials_for_pathology_residents | Rapid Revision]] is generally advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. For subjects like Pathology and Microbiology, RR notes supplemented with a Q-bank can be sufficient, provided concepts are clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

### When to use Main Videos
For certain "bulky" subjects, or those known for complex and atypical questions, referring to main videos is recommended, even if time is a constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. These include:
*   **Final Year Subjects:** Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, and PSM (Community Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. PSM, in particular, often features intricate questions that may not be fully covered by just rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Anatomy:** Especially if a student feels weak in this subject, main videos can provide the necessary foundational understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **"Nightmare" Subjects:** For subjects that cause significant difficulty or anxiety (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology), main videos should be prioritized to build confidence and deeper understanding. The goal is to "kill the scare" associated with these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.

For any subject where rapid revision alone doesn't build confidence (e.g., Pharmacology), switching to main videos is the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.

## Previous Year Topics (PYT) and Q-Banks
[[medical_exam_preparation_strategies | Previous Year Topics]] (PYT) or Previous Year Questions (PYQs) are highly important and should be a focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **NEET PG:** Aim to cover PYQs from the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
*   **INI CET:** Focus on the last three years' PYQs due to changes in exam patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

### Integrating Q-Banks
Q-banks should be used alongside daily subject study; there are no separate days allocated for Q-bank practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.
*   **Bulky Subjects:** For subjects like Medicine, Surgery, Gynecology, PSM, Anatomy, and Pharmacology, a full Q-bank should be attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>.
*   **Short Subjects:** For shorter subjects, or where RR notes are sufficient, the [[resources_and_study_materials_for_pathology_residents | Rapid Revision]] Q-bank is adequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

Aim to solve 100-150 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. This target should be gradually increased if starting at a lower number (e.g., 70-80 questions per day), increasing by 5-10 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Questions should be specific to the subject being studied that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Last Round Revision (LRR)
LRR sessions for NEET PG will be conducted in January and February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>. These are designed to be a passive form of rapid revision, where students can listen at 2x speed for quick recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. LRR is excellent for last-month revision but should not be the *only* source of study from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>.

## Strategy for Interns
Interns should follow the same subject sequence as the main timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. However, they should allocate one extra day for each subject due to limited study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. The primary resources for interns should be [[resources_and_study_materials_for_pathology_residents | Rapid Revision]] videos combined with a Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. Main videos are generally not recommended for interns unless addressing a specific weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

Interns can use "light posting" periods (e.g., 15-day postings) to complete short subjects like Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, and Forensic Medicine, which can provide a significant confidence boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

## General Advice on Resources
*   **Stick to One Source:** Once a platform or set of notes has been chosen, it is important to stick to it rather than constantly switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.
*   **Avoid Review Books and Standard Textbooks:** There is no time for review books or standard textbooks (like Robbins for Pathology) when the exam is only months away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. If weak in a topic, refer to main videos instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>.
*   **Crash Courses/BTR:** These can run concurrently with the primary [[studying_techniques_and_tips_for_medical_subjects | study cycle]] (notes, Q-bank, GT) and serve to condense information or provide an extra boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. However, they should not replace in-depth study if time permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.
*   **Daily Notes:** For daily revision and recall, consider making concise notes for the last 10 days of study, focusing on key buzzwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
The overarching strategy is to balance comprehensive study for critical subjects with efficient revision for others, while consistently applying knowledge through MCQs and grand tests. Confidence is built through consistent practice and addressing weak areas proactively.

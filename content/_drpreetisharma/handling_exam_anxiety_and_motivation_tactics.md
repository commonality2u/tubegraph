The period following exam results can be a challenging time, especially if outcomes were not as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. It's common to feel anxious and demotivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. However, it's crucial to remember that failures are a part of life, and this isn't the first or last you'll encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:06:00">[43:06:00]</a>. The key is to find a "ray of hope" and maintain a positive outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## Addressing Exam Anxiety

The trauma of past exam results can be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. It's important to move past this trauma and focus on the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

### Managing Study Pressure

*   **Avoid Over-Pressurizing:** Do not put unnecessary pressure on yourself, especially regarding scores in initial Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. Three months is sufficient time for gradual improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.
*   **Time Table Flexibility:** Don't blame yourself if you can't adhere to a timetable 100%. If you complete 80-85% of your daily backlog, that's good enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. No one finishes 100% of their timetable every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.

### Subject-Specific Concerns

*   **Medicine:** The vastness of medicine can cause anxiety and palpitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects (Pharma, Biochem, Micro):** These subjects often cause fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>. The best approach is to read the rapid revision notes many times to become an expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. There is no shortcut; repeated revision is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Question-Solving Fear

*   **Clinical Questions:** Fear of clinical correlation and lengthy questions is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. To overcome this, practice questions to improve [[importance_of_time_management_and_sleep_cycle_for_exams | time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. Learn to identify buzzwords and highlighted points to quickly solve questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:36:00">[37:36:00]</a>.

## Motivation Tactics for [[exam_preparation_strategies | Exam Success]]

With the December exam approaching, set a clear agenda for proper [[exam_preparation_strategies | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

### The "75 Hard Challenge" Approach

Inspired by the "75 Hard Challenge," create your own version for exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

*   **Establish a Baseline:** Before starting your detailed study plan, take a Grand Test today to establish a baseline score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. This will show you where you currently stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   **Small, Gradual Targets:** Instead of aiming for a massive jump, set small targets to improve your score by 5-10 marks in every subsequent Grand Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. This step-by-step approach will help you reach your desired score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:30:00">[36:30:00]</a>.
*   **Analyze Grand Tests:** When your score doesn't cross the target, identify the specific subjects that caused the drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:20:00">[38:20:00]</a>. Dedicate time to revise these weaker areas aggressively, and you'll see your results improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:33:00">[38:33:00]</a>. This is key for [[handling_grand_test_anxiety_and_score_analysis | Grand Test anxiety and score analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

### Cultivating Discipline and Dedication

*   **Consistent Study Hours:** Aim for 12-14 hours of dedicated study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. This consistent effort is essential to clear the December exam and avoid the June 2024 session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.
*   **No Skipping:** Dedication and discipline are paramount. Do not skip daily study sessions with the thought of doing it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.
*   **Active Learning:** Passive learning, like just listening to videos or classes, is easy but won't get you marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>. Engage in active learning by asking yourself questions, recalling information, and testing your understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>.
    *   For example, close your notes and try to recall answers to questions, or ask a study partner to quiz you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>. This builds confidence and reveals what you truly remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>.

### Setting a Clear Purpose

*   **Define Your "Why":** On the first page of your book, write down your purpose for studying for 12 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56:00">[41:56:00]</a>. Whether it's for yourself, family, or personal dreams and aspirations, this purpose should be in front of you every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:04:00">[42:04:00]</a>. It will motivate you to study when you want to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:31:00">[42:31:00]</a>.
*   **Write Your Deserving Score:** Alongside your purpose, write down the score you deserve and aspire to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>. This goal will stare at you for the next three months, serving as a constant reminder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:00">[42:48:00]</a>.

### Maintaining Positivity

*   **Smile and Positive Attitude:** Study with a positive mindset and a smile on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>.
*   **Motto:** Remember the phrase: "It's not over until you win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>. Keep this as your wallpaper or on your notice board to maintain that winning attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:45:00">[43:45:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Overthink:** Don't dwell on factors beyond your control, like potential exam pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:29:00">[47:29:00]</a>. Focus on studying, revising notes, and solving questions with 200% effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:33:00">[47:33:00]</a>. The rest will fall into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:00">[47:41:00]</a>.

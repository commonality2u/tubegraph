*Aspergillus* is a genus of fungi with distinct morphological characteristics that aid in their identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. The study of fungi is known as [[Mycology Common fungi and their identification markers | mycology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Cultivation and Staining
Fungal samples, including *Aspergillus*, are commonly grown on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. To study the culture morphology under a microscope, Lactophenol Cotton Blue (LPCB) stain is typically used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

## Specific *Aspergillus* Species
Different *Aspergillus* species can be distinguished by their colony appearance and microscopic features of their conidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

### Aspergillus niger
*   **Colony Appearance**: Shows black colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Appearance**: Retains its black color even when viewed under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.

### Aspergillus fumigatus
*   **Colony Appearance**: Gives a smoky green color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Appearance**: When stained with Lactophenol Cotton Blue, the conidia arise only from the top part of the vesicle, resembling fumes rising upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

### Aspergillus flavus
*   **Colony Appearance**: Produces bright yellow and green colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Appearance**: The conidia originate from every side or the entire circumference of the vesicle, similar to petals spreading out from a flower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.

## Diagnostic Markers
Beyond morphological identification, specific markers can be used for *Aspergillus* detection:
*   [[mycology_common_fungi_and_their_identification_markers#Galactomannan_Testing | Galactomannan]] testing is primarily used for *Aspergillus* species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>.
*   [[mycology_common_fungi_and_their_identification_markers#Beta-1,3-D-Glucan_Testing | Beta-1,3-D-Glucan]] testing can also be positive for *Aspergillus*, among many other fungal organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. It is negative for *Blastomyces*, *Mucor*, and *Cryptococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>.

[[Sterilization and disinfection methods | Sterilization and disinfection methods]] can be broadly categorized into physical and chemical methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. While physical methods include heat and radiation, chemical methods involve the use of various chemical agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

## Types of Chemical Disinfectants

### Alcohols
The most important alcohol used is isopropyl alcohol, typically at a concentration of 70% to 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>. It is commonly used for sterilizing stethoscopes and thermometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

### Aldehydes
There are two main types of aldehydes used:

*   **Glutaraldehyde (Cidex)**
    *   Glutaraldehyde is commonly known as Cidex solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
    *   It is used for sterilizing various types of "scopes" such as bronchoscopes, laryngoscopes, endoscopes, proctoscopes, and colonoscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.
    *   It is not used for thermometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>, as isopropyl alcohol is preferred for those <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>.

*   **Formaldehyde**
    *   Formaldehyde exists in two forms:
        *   **Liquid Formalin:** Used for pathology specimens and preserving cadavers in anatomy labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.
        *   **Formaldehyde Gas:** Used for operating theater (OT) fumigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>, alongside non-ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>.

### Phenols
Phenols include common disinfectants like Lysol, Savlon, Dettol, and O-cresols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. They are used for disinfecting floors and cleaning sharp instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

### Halogens
Halogens used in disinfection include:

*   **Iodine:** Such as tincture iodine and Betadine, which are brownish solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.
*   **Chloride:** Including the commonly used 1% sodium hypochlorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>.
    *   Sodium hypochlorite (1%) is considered the most potent disinfectant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.
    *   It is used to decontaminate blood spills on floors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. Earlier recommendations suggested 10% concentration, but 1% is now used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.

### Gaseous Sterilization
Gaseous sterilization primarily uses ethylene oxide (ETO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>.

*   **Ethylene Oxide (ETO)**
    *   It should not be used at 100% concentration because it is inflammable and carcinogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
    *   Latest recommendations suggest using it at a 3% concentration, diluted with other gases like nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.
    *   It is used for sterilizing cardiopulmonary machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.
    *   The control organism for gas sterilization (ethylene oxide) is *Bacillus globigii* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

## Testing Disinfectants
To assess the effectiveness of a disinfectant, four main tests are performed:

1.  **Phenol Coefficient Test / Riedel Walker Test**
    *   This test compares a given solution (e.g., solution X) with phenol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>.
    *   A limitation is that it only compares against phenol and does not account for effectiveness against fungi, spores, or in the presence of organic matter like soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

2.  **Modified Riedel Walker Test / Chick Martin Test**
    *   This is a more modern and modified version of the Riedel Walker test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.
    *   It tests the disinfectant's ability to kill organisms in the presence of organic matter (like soil), yeast, and fungi (spores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

3.  **Kelsey Sykes Test (Capacity Test)**
    *   This test determines the reusability or capacity of a disinfectant solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>. It assesses how many times the solution can be effectively used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.

4.  **Kelsey Morrows Test (In-Use Test)**
    *   This test evaluates the practical effectiveness of the disinfectant when it is actually put to use in a clinical setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. It is the final step to confirm its suitability for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

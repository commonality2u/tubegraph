[[signet_ring_cells_in_gastric_cancer | Signet ring cells]] are a distinctive histological feature often associated with certain types of cancer, particularly [[Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors and Their Mutations | gastric cancer]]. Their unique appearance is a crucial diagnostic indicator in pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

## Histological Features
[[signet_ring_cells_in_gastric_cancer | Signet ring cells]] derive their name from their resemblance to a signet ring, where the nucleus is pushed to one side of the cell by a large, clear vacuole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This characteristic appearance is primarily due to the accumulation of mucin within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

## Associated Conditions

### Diffuse Gastric Cancer (Linitis Plastica)
[[signet_ring_cells_in_gastric_cancer | Signet ring cells]] are classically seen in diffuse gastric cancer, also known as Linitis Plastica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. In this condition, the cancer infiltrates the wall of the stomach, causing it to become very hard and thickened, resembling a "leather bottle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Unlike other gastric cancers that form a fungating growth, diffuse gastric cancer spreads within the stomach wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

### Genetic Alterations in Diffuse Gastric Cancer
The most common genetic alteration associated with diffuse gastric cancer is a mutation in the CDH1 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
*   **CDH1 Gene:** The CDH1 gene encodes for E-cadherin, a protein crucial for cell-to-cell adhesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. It acts like "glue" or "Fevicol" that holds cells together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **Impact of Mutation:** When the CDH1 gene is mutated, this "glue" is lost, allowing cancer cells to detach and become invasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This loss of cell adhesion contributes to the diffuse spread of the cancer within the stomach wall.
*   **Other Cancers:** The loss of this "glue" can also lead to other "golu tumors," such as [[Breast cancer immunohistochemistry and gene amplification | invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

### Other Tumors
[[signet_ring_cells_in_gastric_cancer | Signet ring cells]] can also be found in other tumors, particularly those with a high mucin content. An example mentioned is the Krukenberg tumor of the ovary, which also exhibits [[signet_ring_cells_in_gastric_cancer | signet ring cells]] due to the presence of mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

The [[Pathogen identification and characteristics | bacterium]] *Vibrio cholerae* is known to produce [[Bacteriology of E coli UTI and Diarrhea Strains | cholera toxin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> and Zonula Occludens Toxin (ZOT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. *Vibrio cholerae* infection typically leads to "rice water stools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Cholera Toxin (CT)
Cholera toxin is composed of two main fragments: A and B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Fragment B: Binding
Fragment B is responsible for the toxin's binding to intestinal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. It specifically binds to GM1 ganglioside located on the intestinal cell surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Fragment A: Action
Fragment A carries out the primary mechanism of action intracellularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Its function is to activate adenylate cyclase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, which results in an increase of cyclic AMP (cAMP) within the cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Laboratory Identification of *Vibrio cholerae*

### Culture Media
The specific culture medium used for *Vibrio cholerae* is TCBS (Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts Sucrose) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   *Vibrio cholerae* is a sucrose fermenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   Upon fermentation, it produces a yellow color on TCBS media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   The original indicator in TCBS media is bromothymol blue (BTB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### String Test
*Vibrio cholerae* also demonstrates positivity for the string test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

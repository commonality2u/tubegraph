This article describes the identification of [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | multinucleated giant cells]] and epithelioid cells through fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and biopsy, crucial for diagnosing conditions like [[granulomatous_lymphadenitis_diagnosis | granulomatous lymphadenitis]]. This content is part of the "Image of the Day" (IOTD) series, which examines various medical cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Case Presentation: Neck Swelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

A patient presented with a neck swelling, which underwent FNAC followed by a biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The objective was to provide a diagnosis based on the microscopic images.

## FNAC Findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

The FNAC image revealed two striking features:

*   **[[giant_cells_and_granulomas | Multinucleated Giant Cell]]**: A very large cell with multiple nuclei visible within its cytoplasm. This is a characteristic finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Epithelioid Cells**: Numerous cells with elongated or "slipper-shaped" nuclei, as opposed to round nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The slipper-shaped nucleus is a key identifier for an epithelioid cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The presence of both [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | multinucleated giant cells]] and epithelioid cells strongly suggests the formation of a [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granuloma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Biopsy Findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

The biopsy picture corroborated the FNAC findings, showing the same cellular components:

*   **[[giant_cells_and_granulomas | Giant Cells]]**: Again, large cells with many nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Epithelioid Cells**: Identified by their elongated, slipper-shaped nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Lymphocytic Collar**: Small, blue-colored cells, identified as lymphocytes, forming a ring around the periphery of the lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This lymphocytic collar is a characteristic component that surrounds a [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granuloma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Components of a Granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

A typical [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granuloma]] is constituted by three main components:
1.  [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | Giant cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>
2.  Epithelioid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>
3.  A lymphocytic collar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>

It is also possible to identify a [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granuloma]] even without a visible [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | giant cell]], by observing epithelioid cells surrounded by a lymphocytic collar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Caseous Necrosis in Tuberculosis Granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>

If the [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granuloma]] were due to tuberculosis (TB), an additional feature, caseous necrosis, would be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Gross Image**: A lymph node affected by TB would show a "cheesy appearance" on its cut surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **FNAC of Necrosis**: An FNAC of this caseous necrosis would appear as pink, granular, and non-homogeneous "dirty material," indicating cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>

Based on the presence of [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | giant cells]], slipper-shaped epithelioid cells, and a lymphocytic collar in both FNAC and biopsy, the diagnosis for the neck swelling is [[granulomatous_lymphadenitis_diagnosis | granulomatous lymphadenitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

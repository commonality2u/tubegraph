Maintaining a positive mindset and fostering belief in oneself and a higher power is crucial for success, especially during high-stakes exams. Panic and palpitations are normal feelings before an exam, but it's important to settle down and ease oneself for a good night's sleep, which is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Strategies for Maintaining Positivity

### Managing Exam Day Emotions
It's vital to allow time to get your heart rate back to normal before the exam begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Between exam papers, avoid discussing questions or results with others, as this can unnecessarily make the second paper more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Engaging in such discussions, especially about questions you might have missed or answered incorrectly, can lead to unnecessary self-doubt and negativity for the upcoming paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. It's best to stay away from any discussions and close your ears to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Approaching Difficult Questions
Understand that in a two-paper exam, one paper might be perceived as easy and the other as difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. If the first paper feels challenging, do not lose hope or conclude that it's the end of your journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Some questions, typically 10-20% of the total, are designed to be "bouncers" – questions that even experts might struggle with, intended to maintain the screening level of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Do not focus on these bouncer questions, as they are not meant for anyone to solve and can demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Instead, acknowledge them, make an educated guess, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The focus should be on avoiding silly mistakes in the easier questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Overcoming Negative Self-Talk
Carrying negativity can lead to silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Instead, affirm that "Tomorrow is my day," which helps normalize your heart rate and prevent silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Avoid self-doubt, the feeling that you haven't studied well, or that your memory is failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Trust in your preparation and believe in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

> "If you believe in me... one last advice take from me is from right now till tomorrow till the end of the exam you do not have to think of anything negative... For these next few hours... just want to think of everything positive that has happened and will happen to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>

### The Power of Faith and Confidence
Believe in something or someone that will never betray you, whether it's God, the universe, energy, or the blessings of your parents and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This faith provides security and helps ward off negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

On exam day, embrace overconfidence until you reach the exam hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Be confident that your preparation, strategy, and teachers were the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. This confidence will help you reach the examination hall. Once there, maintain a sane and practical mindset, reading every question and option carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges

*   **Switch On/Switch Off Mode**: Practice a "switch on, switch off" approach for each question. Focus entirely on the current question, attempt it, then switch off that thought and move to the next. Do not dwell on previous questions or anticipate future ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut Feeling**: Your first gut feeling is often correct, especially when you're not under extreme pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Avoid [[managing_exam_anxiety_and_stress | overthinking]] and changing answers in the last moments due to panic, as this often leads to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
*   **Embrace Imperfection**: It's human to make some silly mistakes; don't take them too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The goal is to prevent these errors from being amplified by panic and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Resilience**: Remember that you are fighters who have overcome many struggles. An exam is a relatively small challenge compared to life's other hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. You are already doctors; the exam is just a formality to gain legal recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Your true worth is not defined by one piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Ignore External Judgement**: Do not worry about what others will say if you don't clear the exam. Your true supporters—your parents and teachers—know your hard work and will stand by you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

> "No one is here to judge you because someone who's been in your journey... knows that you have worked hard... what ever will happen these are your true people who will stand by you what so ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>

By focusing on positivity, trusting in your preparation, and managing your emotional state, you can effectively tackle the exam.

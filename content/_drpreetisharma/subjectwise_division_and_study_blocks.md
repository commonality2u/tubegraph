Dr. Preeti Sharma outlines a strategic 60-day plan for the upcoming December 2024 FMGE exam, designed for all students, whether first-time test-takers or those who did not achieve a score above 150 in the recent June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This plan spans from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, with a subsequent revision plan to be introduced later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Overall Study Plan Overview
The overall plan for the FMGE exam is divided into two main phases:
1.  **60-Day Timetable**: Focuses on completing the syllabus and establishing a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This phase runs from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  **Revision Plan**: To be shared after the 60-day period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, this phase is structured into three revisions:
    *   Revision 1: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    *   Revision 2: 25 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
    *   Revision 3: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

## Key Principles for the 60-Day Plan
The 60-day plan emphasizes a dual focus on theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Daily MCQs**: Aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If you are not currently practicing this many, gradually increase your daily count by 15-20 MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. [[importance_of_question_banks_and_mcqs_in_exam_preparation | The key to cracking this exam is how many MCQs you practice on a daily basis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Study Hours**: Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This is crucial for completing the syllabus within 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Single Source**: Utilize a single source (notes/faculty) for each subject to ensure consistency and avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   [[choosing_between_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_for_different_subjects | Video Selection]]:
    *   For **stronger subjects** (80% or more in Q-bank): Refer to Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   For **weaker subjects** (less than 80% in Q-bank): Refer to main videos for specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   **Pathology and Microbiology**: Always use Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Subject-Wise Division into Blocks
The subjects are divided into four integrated blocks to facilitate understanding and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Block 1: Anatomy, Surgical & Radiology
*   **Anatomy**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>
*   **Surgery**: 6 days (integrated with Anatomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   **Orthopedics**: 2 days (integrated with Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
*   **Radiology**: 2 days (to wrap up imaging aspects from Surgery and Ortho) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

### Block 2: Basic Sciences & Medicine Related
This block is designed to build a strong foundation for medicine.
*   **Pathology**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
    *   For [[pathology_study_techniques_and_mnemonics | Pathology]], Dr. Sharma recommends using PrepLadder's 19-hour rapid revision videos, aiming for about 5 hours of video lectures per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. These can be watched at 1.5x to 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Microbiology**: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
    *   For [[bacteriology_study_strategies | Microbiology]], PrepLadder's 16-hour rapid revision videos are recommended, also aiming for 5 hours per day at around 1.5x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Pharmacology (Pharma)**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
*   **Medicine**: 6 days (becomes easier after completing Path, Micro, Pharma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   **Pediatrics**: 2 days (overlaps with Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   **Physiology (Extra)**: 1 day (for remaining topics, possibly from RR or LRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
*   **Dermatology (Derma)**: 1 day (correlates with Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

### Block 3: OBG & Anesthesia
*   **OBGY**: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   **Anesthesia**: 2 days (to wrap up after surgical branches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

### Block 4: Standalone Subjects
These subjects have their own distinct question sets.
*   **PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine)**: 5 days (due to increasing difficulty of questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
*   **Biochemistry (Biocham)**: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>

*   **Forensic Medicine & Toxicology (FMT)**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   **Psychiatry**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

## Integrating Grand Tests (GTs)
The 60-day plan includes two days specifically for Grand Tests and their review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This brings the total study days to 58 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **GT 1**: Around September 8th, after completing 15 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **GT 2**: September 21st, marking the end of the 60-day timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## The Philosophy of the 60-Day Plan
This timetable encourages a mindset of "no past guilt, no future anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The focus is solely on the present 60-day period to maximize study efficiency and mental clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## [[daily_study_schedule_for_fmge | Daily Study Schedule for FMGE]]
To manage time effectively and maintain consistency, Dr. Sharma recommends a structured daily schedule based on "time-boxing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>:

*   **Morning Routine (Before 8:00 AM)**: Take one hour to enjoy your morning, including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)**: 3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM)**: 30 minutes. Relax, close eyes, listen to music, talk to family/friends. Avoid social media/screens during this short break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. By lunchtime, you've completed 5.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM)**: 1.5 hours. Includes lunch (30 mins) and power nap or personal choice activities like social media or watching something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)**: 1 hour. Mix of physical activity (20 mins) and social interaction or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM)**: 2 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Evening MCQs (9:00 PM onwards)**: Create a custom module of 30 mixed questions from subjects finished so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This casual test helps stay in touch with past subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. It should take about 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Wind Down & Sleep (By 11:00 PM - 11:30 PM)**: Relax, watch a web series, engage in social media, or any preferred leisure activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Aim for 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

> [!TIP] Consistency and vigilance are paramount for this plan to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Remember, "This too shall pass" â€“ even if it's a tough journey, better days will come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

## Introduction
[[discussion_on_brain_tumors | Brain tumors]] can be characterized by specific histological features and genetic alterations, which aid in their diagnosis and prognosis. The identification of these features is often crucial in pathology. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>

## Types of Brain Tumors and Their Histological Characteristics

### Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma (JPA)
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Often seen in children with a cystic lesion in the cerebellum. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>
*   **Histological Features:** Characterized by the presence of pink, stringy structures known as Rosenthal fibers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>
*   **Genetic Alterations:** Associated with the BRAF V600E mutation, though BRAF fusion is more commonly observed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>
*   **Prognosis:** Has an excellent prognosis with nearly 100% survival after surgical removal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>

### Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
*   **Imaging:** Often presents as a "butterfly glioma" due to its spread across the corpus callosum. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:28">[01:09:28]</a>
*   **Histological Features:**
    *   **Serpentine Necrosis:** Characterized by large areas of necrosis surrounded by pseudopalisading tumor cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>
    *   **Grade:** A highly aggressive, Grade IV tumor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>
*   **Prognosis:** Carries a very poor prognosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>

### Oligodendroglioma
*   **Histological Features:**
    *   **Fried Egg Appearance:** Cells exhibit a clear halo around the nucleus, resembling a fried egg. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>
    *   **Chicken Wire Blood Vessels:** Delicate, branching capillary networks reminiscent of chicken wire. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>
        *   _Note:_ [[breast_cancer_pathology_and_genetics | Chicken wire blood vessels]] on FNAC in the breast are seen in mucinous carcinoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>

### Meningioma
*   **Clinical/Imaging:**
    *   More common in females. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>
    *   Radiology often shows a "dural tail sign." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>
*   **Histological Features:**
    *   **Whirling Appearance:** Tumor cells grow in concentric patterns, forming whorls. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>
    *   **Psammoma Bodies:** Calcified, concentric lamellated structures (soma bodies). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>
*   **Associated Features:** Often positive for progesterone receptors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>

### Rosettes in Brain Tumors
Rosettes are specific arrangements of tumor cells around a central lumen or structure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>

#### Pseudo Rosettes
*   **Homer Wright Pseudo Rosettes:**
    *   Characterized by tumor cells arranged around a central pink, fibrillar neuropil. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>
    *   Seen in:
        *   Medulloblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>
        *   Neuroblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>
        *   Ewing Sarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>
        *   Retinoblastoma (though true rosettes are more common) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>
*   **Perivascular Pseudo Rosettes:**
    *   Tumor cells radially arranged around a central blood vessel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>
    *   Seen in: Ependymoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>

#### True Rosettes
*   **Flexner-Wintersteiner Rosettes:**
    *   Cells form a true lumen with a clear, empty center (lumen). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>
    *   Seen in: Retinoblastoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>
    *   This is the most common rosette type in Retinoblastoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>

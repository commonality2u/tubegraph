This article discusses various aspects of [[renal_and_genital_pathology | renal and genital pathology]], focusing on the diagnosis and histological features of kidney tumors and other renal diseases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> It also briefly touches upon specific genetic alterations and associated syndromes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

## Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)

Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is a common kidney malignancy, often presenting with symptoms like right flank pain and hematuria. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> Diagnosis is supported by CCT scans revealing a tumor mass, confirmed by nephrectomy and histological examination. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>

### Types of Renal Cell Carcinoma

#### Clear Cell RCC
*   **Prevalence:** Most common type of RCC. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   **Histology:** Characterized by "empty clear cells." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> Images show white, empty, clear cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
*   **Genetics:** Associated with deletion of chromosome 3p. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> This is linked to Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>

#### Papillary RCC
*   **Histology:** Cells are arranged in a papillary pattern. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> Like other papillary tumors in the body (thyroid, breast, kidney, endometrium, ovary, brain), they commonly show psammoma bodies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>
*   **Associations:** Often seen in patients with a history of dialysis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   **Genetics:**
    *   Associated with loss of the Y chromosome. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>
    *   Commonly linked to trisomy 7 and 17. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
    *   Fumarate hydratase gene mutation (FH gene) can cause Papillary RCC, particularly Type 2. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> This mutation is also associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>

#### Chromophobe RCC
*   **Genetics:** Exhibits multiple chromosomal losses (e.g., chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 10, 13). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> This is remembered as "chromophobe" (fear of chromosomes). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
*   **Associated Syndrome:** Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a> This syndrome is also associated with fibrofolliculomas (skin appendix tumor). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>
*   **Histology:** Cells resemble plant cells, featuring a proper cell outline, a dark, "raisinoid" nucleus, and a distinct perinuclear halo (white area around the nucleus). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>
*   **Special Stain:** Hale's colloidal iron stain produces a blue color. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>

#### Bellini Duct (Collecting Duct) RCC
*   **Prognosis:** Has the worst prognosis among RCC types. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>

#### Medullary RCC
*   **Association:** Strongly associated with sickle cell trait, not sickle cell anemia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a> This is often observed in patients with HbAS genotype. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>

#### Pediatric RCC (Xp11 Translocation RCC)
*   **Genetics:** Associated with TFE3 gene translocations on the X chromosome. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a> While classically a childhood cancer, it can rarely occur in adults. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>

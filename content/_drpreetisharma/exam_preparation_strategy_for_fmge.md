With approximately 10 days remaining until the [[FMGE December 2023 Exam Preparation Strategy | FMGE January 20th exam]], this period is crucial and considered "make or break" for aspirants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This guide focuses on key strategies, do's, and don'ts for [[FMGE preparation strategy | FMGE preparation]] to maximize your chances of success.

## General Do's and Don'ts

*   **No New Major Study** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>: Avoid starting entirely new, large subjects like Medicine, Surgery, or OBGYN in depth if you haven't already <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The goal is to know "little by little" about all 19 subjects, aiming to answer at least 5 out of 10 questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Topics**: Do not delve into rare topics within subjects you've already studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Address Leftover Subjects**: For subjects you haven't studied at all (e.g., Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensics), prioritize watching 3-hour long LRR (Last Minute Rapid Revision) sessions or crash courses. The aim is to understand enough to solve at least 50% of questions from these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Normalize Sleep Cycle**: Adjust your sleep schedule to align with the exam timing. You need to be alert in the morning hours to solve questions effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Aim for a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Experimentation**: Do not try new medications or routines the day before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Stick to your established routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## Subject Management Strategy

Categorize subjects to manage your time effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Short Subjects (8 subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>
*   **Examples**: Head & Neck, Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensics, Skin, ENT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Approach**: Rapid revision (RR) notes (if you're a fast reader) or YouTube LRR sessions combined with solving all [[Utilizing Previous Year Question Papers for FMGE | Previous Year Questions]] (PYQs) and related topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Time Allocation**: Aim for a 2.5-day target for these eight subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Volatile/Giant Subjects (5 subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   **Examples**: Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. These are considered difficult to retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Approach**: Focus on LRR sessions and [[Utilizing Previous Year Question Papers for FMGE | previous year topics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Do not aim for in-depth main videos or full rapid revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Even if you haven't studied them, do at least 4 hours of LRR and 150-200 PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.
*   **Mindset**: Accept that these subjects are challenging; the goal is to manage them for the exam and then move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

### Clinical Subjects & Others (remaining subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
*   **Examples**: Clinical subjects (Medicine, Surgery, OBGYN), Pathology, Physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Approach**: Primarily focus on [[Utilizing Previous Year Question Papers for FMGE | previous year topics]] and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Full revision of these subjects is not feasible in 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>

Divide your day into four main time slots:

1.  **Study Pattern (Theory & MCQs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>
    *   **Time Allocation**: Target 12-14 productive hours of study daily, focusing fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. If you can complete your daily targets in 8-9 hours, that's fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
    *   **Balance**: Dedicate 40% of your time to theory (LRR PDFs) and 60% to MCQs, as solving MCQs also covers theory through explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
    *   **MCQ Quantity**: Aim to solve at least 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Gradually increase by 10-15 questions each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
    *   **MCQ Type**: Prioritize new questions over memorized PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Focus on PYQ *topics* rather than just questions, solving related MCQs from your Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
    *   **MCQ Review**: If an MCQ is correct, do not read the explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. If incorrect, superficially read the explanation (5-10 lines) to identify if it was a silly mistake or knowledge gap, then move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   **Sustained Focus**: Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch without breaks or distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.

2.  **Images** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>
    *   **Time Allocation**: Dedicate 1 hour daily to images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
    *   **Method**: At the end of the day, quickly scan through images related to the subjects you studied, especially before sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Image-based revision can significantly speed up your process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>.

3.  **Sanity Time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>
    *   **Time Allocation**: 30 minutes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
    *   **Activities**: Engage in an outdoor activity like a light walk, spend time with friends, or briefly use social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This helps prevent mental exhaustion and keeps life feeling normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

## Grand Test (GT) Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>

*   **Personal Choice**: Deciding whether to give a GT in the last 9 days is personal. If you feel you can handle any score positively, go ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: The primary purpose of giving a GT now is **time management** (can you finish 300 questions within the given time?) and **catching silly mistakes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Score De-emphasis**: Do *not* focus on the score (e.g., reaching 150+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. A low score can cause panic and anxiety, hindering further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. High scores might lead to overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **New Questions**: GTs will always have 20-30 "bouncer" questions you haven't seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. These are designed to prevent overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. Do not let these questions determine your preparation assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. Your pass/fail is decided by the topics you know and avoiding silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Analysis for Low Scores**: If you're stuck between 130-150 in GTs, quickly analyze where you're making mistakes: silly mistakes (need more MCQ practice) or knowledge gaps (need to revise LRR notes/topics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.

## Managing Anxiety and Positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>

*   **Embrace Positivity**: Surround yourself with positive people like family, good friends, and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Avoid Negativity**: Stay away from people who boast about high scores or spread rumors about exam difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Block Negative Thoughts**: Do not let negative thought processes enter your mind, as one negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. This includes worries about the exam day logistics (alarm, reach, computer function) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   **Accept Forgetting**: It's normal to feel like you're forgetting subjects. No one can memorize all 19 subjects perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. If you forget something, just pick it up and revise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **Mindset over Knowledge**: Success in competitive exams is a mixture of knowledge and mindset – how you approach the exam and maintain mental stability in the last days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

## Utilizing Previous Year Questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>

*   **FMGE PYQs**: The last 5 years of FMGE PYQs are mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. There is no escape from doing these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **NEET PG PYQs**: If time permits, do the last 3 years of NEET PG questions (as it's once a year, this means 3 papers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Focus on recall sessions if you cannot do them by yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **INI CET**: If extra time is available after the above, consider the recent November INI CET paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Not doing this won't be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.
*   **Method for PYQs**: If you can't open books to revise, listen to video recall sessions at 1.5x or 2x speed. This is better than doing nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
*   **Flashback Sessions**: Consider watching "Flashback" sessions on YouTube, which cover previous year questions of all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

## Final Day Strategy

*   **Last Day Revision**: Focus on [[role_of_rapid_revision_in_fmge_success | PYQs and LRR]] (Last Minute Rapid Revision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. Revise volatile subjects and those you tend to forget easily (e.g., Biochemistry cycles, Microbiology catalysts, Pharmacology drugs, PSM biostatistics and schemes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

## Exam Day Mindset

*   **Two Papers**: Expect one paper to be tough and one to be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
*   **During Break**: Do not discuss Paper 1 during the break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. Disconnect from it and prepare mentally for Paper 2 without carrying over any backlog or hangover from Paper 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.
*   **Overall Goal**: Your goal is to cross 150 by combining scores from both papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

The exact date for NEET PG 2025 is currently unknown, and it's impossible to predict due to past uncertainties and postponements. Candidates should focus on making a plan that can be completed, with the understanding that a final timetable will be developed once the official date is announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Waiting for the date is not advisable, as it may be announced too close to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Given recent delays in counseling, a March 2025 exam date seems unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## The 65-Day Study Plan

A comfortable and balanced [[65day_study_plan_and_timetable_for_neet_pg | 65-day study plan]] is proposed, which can be adapted by all students, including those who have taken a drop or are currently interning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For interns, it's recommended to add 2-3 extra days for long subjects and one day for short subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A buffer of plus/minus 10 days for backlog is also acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Key Timelines
*   **December**: Focus on [[FMGE December 2023 Exam Preparation Strategy | FMGE quizzes]] for practice, even for NEET PG aspirants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **January & February**: Specific NEET PG quizzes will be available on the Prepladder app, aligning with potential date clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **February**: YouTube live sessions will be conducted, focusing on the art of solving MCQs rather than repeating theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Subject-wise Breakdown (approximate days)
The plan balances subjects and includes occasional Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Anatomy**: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. (Can be overwhelming; consider allied subjects like Orthopedics, Surgery, and Radiology to reinforce learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.)
*   **Orthopedics**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Biochemistry**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **ENT**: 3 days (due to increasing difficulty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Psychiatry**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Pathology**: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Rapid Revision videos (approx. 20 hours) are recommended, especially if you've seen them before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Microbiology**: 4 days (approx. 15 hours of video lectures + QBank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Rapid Revision is the same for FMGE and NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Other Short Subjects (Dermatology, Anesthesia, Radiology)**: 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **PSM (Community Medicine)**: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Surgery**: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **OBGY**: 6 days (first read should be extensive with MCQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Ophthalmology**: 3 days (neuro-ophthalmology can be challenging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Pediatrics**: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Pharmacology**: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Physiology**: 2 days, best studied after other subjects and Medicine as it integrates many concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Medicine**: Instead of dedicating a block of days, allocate 1-1.5 hours daily for Medicine videos as "clinical posting" to avoid feeling overwhelmed and to integrate concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

## Core Preparation Strategies

### Volatile Topics / "20th Notebook"
*   Maintain a separate notebook (or "chy copy") to list *only* the names of volatile topics or frequently forgotten points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   This notebook should not be a bulky re-write of notes, but a concise list of topics to review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Include your GT mistakes here as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Make this notebook yourself, as what you forget is personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This will be crucial for the last 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Study Approach: Subject-wise vs. System-wise
*   **For first-time learners, interns, or freshers**: A subject-wise approach is recommended to ensure all foundational concepts (General Pathology, General Microbiology, General Pharmacology, General Surgery, Biochemistry) are covered comprehensively and don't get scattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **For those doing second, third, or fourth revisions**: A system-wise approach can be effective for integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   Initially, three GTs in 65 days is a good start, especially if you're not comfortable with the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   If you're more comfortable, aim for one GT every 15 days, or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Analysis is key**: Don't focus on the score, but analyze which subjects/topics you got wrong (factual vs. clinical errors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
    *   **Incorrects**: Analyze thoroughly.
    *   **Confused guesses**: Analyze why you were confused.
    *   **Corrects**: Quickly scan explanations, don't spend too much time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.
*   Use GTs as a guide to identify weaker subjects and adjust your study plan accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   If GT scores aren't improving, it might indicate an issue with McQ management or attempt strategy, requiring more daily practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.
*   To overcome fear of GTs, understand that they are for practice and identifying weaknesses. Finish your "failing quota" now rather than in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.
*   If fearful of GTs, start with smaller custom modules (e.g., 50 mixed questions daily) to build comfort before attempting full GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. Reframe it as "practice question module" rather than "Grand Test" to reduce anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

### Daily Routine
*   **Morning**: Dedicate 1 hour to MCQs using custom modules. Start with subjects already completed, then expand as more subjects are finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. If one revision is complete, make it a 50-question "mini Grand Test" covering all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Night**: Dedicate 1 hour to Medicine videos, like a "clinical posting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Fix a consistent time for this.

### Discipline and Time Management
*   Making a timetable is easy; following it is the hardest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   Requires strong willpower to avoid hitting the snooze button or procrastinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Allocate specific time blocks for studies, internship, social media, and family to maintain balance and prevent mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Rapid Revision (RR) vs. Main Videos
*   **For efficiency**: Rapid Revision videos are often sufficient. For Pathology (approx. 20 hours) and Microbiology (approx. 15 hours), RR is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. If you've used RR 5.0, stick to it; otherwise, use RR 6.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **For concepts**: If you're starting from scratch or struggle with specific topics, begin with RR. If you encounter a concept you don't understand, pause the RR video and briefly refer to the corresponding main video for clarity before returning to RR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   **Avoid passive learning**: After initial video consumption, prioritize active recall through notes and MCQs. Re-watching videos repeatedly (especially within 6 months) can lead to overconfidence without true knowledge retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

### Health and Well-being
*   Physical and mental health should always be the priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
*   Exam success is important, but health is life. Address health issues first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

### Platform and Resources
*   Stick to one platform for notes and videos to avoid confusion and over-information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   While 10% content difference might exist across platforms, 90% is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
*   Utilize free Grand Tests on every platform, as different examiners create them, similar to the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.
*   For QBank, if doing it for the first time, do the full QBank. If you've already completed one round of revision, an RR QBank can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

The most critical step is to **start today**, not tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. Even if it's just decluttering your study space, take the first step towards your plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>. Maintain discipline, analyze your progress (especially GTs), and prioritize your well-being throughout the preparation journey.

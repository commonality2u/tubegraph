The NEET PG 2025 exam date is currently unknown and subject to frequent changes and postponements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Therefore, the best approach is to create a flexible study plan and adapt as new information becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This strategy aims to be comfortable for all students, whether they are re-attempting or in their internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Proposed 65-Day Plan
A 65-day study plan is suggested to cover subjects comprehensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This plan can be extended by 2-3 days for long subjects and one day for short subjects if you are an intern or working doctor, depending on your schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Backlogs of plus/minus 10 days are acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Subject Allocation
The following is a suggested time allocation for various subjects:
*   Anatomy: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   ENT: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   Pathology: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a> (Rapid Revision videos recommended for ~20 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
*   Microbiology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a> (Rapid Revision videos recommended for ~15 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
*   Short Subjects (Derma, Anesthesia, Radiology): 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>
*   PSM: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   OBGY: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>
*   Ophthalmology: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>
*   Pharmacology: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Physiology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> (Best to study at the end as it covers much from other subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>

### Medicine Integration
Medicine is a vast subject. It is recommended to dedicate 1 to 1.5 hours to Medicine *every day* like a clinical posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This approach makes the subject less overwhelming and allows for integration with other topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Fix a specific time, such as 10 p.m., for this daily study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

## Study Methodologies

### Volatile Topics Notebook ("20th Notebook")
Maintain a separate notebook for volatile topics and Grand Test (GT) mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This notebook should *only* list the names of topics, not extensive notes, to avoid becoming bulkier than your original notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Create your own notebook, as what one person forgets differs from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This will be crucial for quick revision in the last 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Subject-wise vs. System-wise Study
If this is your second or subsequent revision, studying system-wise can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, for a first-time revision or if you are an intern, stick to subject-wise study to ensure all general topics (General Pathology, General Microbiology, General Pharmacology, General Surgery, Biochemistry) are covered and not scattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   **Frequency:** Start with occasional GTs, perhaps three in 65 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. If comfortable with the syllabus, aim for one GT every 15 days, or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** GTs are guides for direction, not just scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Analyze your performance to identify weaker subjects or types of mistakes (factual vs. clinical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Analysis:**
    1.  First, analyze incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
    2.  Next, review questions where you were confused or made intelligent guesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.
    3.  Finally, quickly scan the explanations for correct answers to reinforce knowledge, without spending too much time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   **Improving Scores:**
    *   If you're getting factual questions wrong, strengthen subjects like Micro and Pharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.
    *   If clinical questions are problematic, practice more Medicine and Surgery MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
    *   If recall is an issue, revise notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
    *   If [[time_management_and_discipline_for_neet_pg | time management]] is a problem, practice with a timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Fear:** Give GTs frequently to face your fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. It's better to make mistakes in GTs now than in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. Don't focus on the score itself, but on the analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. If GTs are intimidating, start with custom modules of mixed questions to build confidence before attempting full GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

## Daily Routine and Discipline
*   **Morning MCQs:** Dedicate 1 hour every morning to solve custom module MCQs only from subjects you have already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Gradually add more subjects as you complete them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **Evening Medicine:** Study Medicine for 1 hour at a fixed time before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Discipline:** Adhering to the [[time_table_and_revision_strategy_for_neet_pg_2024 | timetable]] requires significant discipline and willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Avoid procrastination and consistently follow your plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Work-Life Balance:** Allocate specific time boxes for studies, internship, social media, and family to avoid mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Resources and Learning

### Rapid Revision (RR) Videos
*   **Pathology & Microbiology:** For NEET PG students, Rapid Revision videos (20 hours for Pathology, 15 hours for Microbiology) are highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. If you've used RR 5.0, stick to it; if new, go for RR 6.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **General Use:** Rapid Revision notes are efficient for quick revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. For working doctors, RR is crucial as covering main videos may be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Use main videos only for topics not understood in RR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   **Starting Fresh:** If concepts are weak, start with RR. If you get stuck, briefly refer to the corresponding main video and then return to RR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

### Quizzes and YouTube Live Sessions
*   **Telegram Quizzes:** December is dedicated to [[FMGE December 2023 exam preparation strategy | FMGE December 2023 exam preparation strategy]] quizzes. NEET PG students should also attempt these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Specific NEET PG quizzes and Last-Minute Revision (LRR) will be on the Prepladder app in January and February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **YouTube Sessions:** Live YouTube sessions will begin in February, focusing on MCQ solving strategies rather than theory repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### QBank Strategy
*   **Full QBank vs. RRQ:** If you have done one round of revision, RRQ Bank can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. If this is your first time, do the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
*   **Source Consistency:** Stick to one QBank platform if doing the main QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. For custom modules, you may use two apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.

### Revisions
The number of revisions will depend on the exam date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. The first reading should be extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Subsequent revisions should narrow down the content, moving from rapid revision to filtered volatile topics for quick last-minute review (e.g., a 10-day revision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

## General Advice
*   **Health First:** Prioritize physical and mental health above everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
*   **Active Learning:** After watching videos once to understand, switch to active recall by working with your notes and solving MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Repeatedly watching videos without active recall can lead to overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.
*   **Notes + QBank:** The core strategy for success is mastering your notes and solving questions from a reliable QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Avoid complicating the strategy by using too many sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.
*   **Source Consistency:** Do not switch platforms for notes and videos once you've chosen one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. However, attempt free GTs from all available platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.
*   **Memorizing Subjects:** For volatile subjects like Biochemistry, Pharmacology, and Microbiology, actively test yourself by covering notes and recalling information, similar to school-day rote learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.
*   **Start Now:** Begin your preparation today. If you can't start studying immediately, at least organize your study space and materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

Renal pathology and cancers are crucial topics for understanding kidney disorders, with a focus on their diagnostic features, genetic alterations, and associated conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)

Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is suspected clinically and radiologically in patients presenting with right flank pain, hematuria, and a palpable flank mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Nephrectomy is a common surgical intervention for such tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Clear Cell RCC (CCC)

*   **Most Common Type**: Clear cell RCC is the most frequently encountered type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Characterized by "empty clear cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, appearing as white, empty cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Genetics**: Associated with deletion of chromosome 3p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> and often linked to [[Pathological features of various diseases | VHL syndrome]] (Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Papillary RCC

*   **Histology**: Shows tall cells arranged in papillae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, and presence of [[Histological and Cytological Features in Pathology | psammoma bodies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Genetics**: Often involves trisomy 7 and 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> and loss of the Y chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Chromophobe RCC

*   **Genetics**: Characterized by multiple chromosomal losses (e.g., chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 10, 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndrome**: Linked to Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, which also features fibrofolliculomas (skin adnexal tumors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Shows "plant cells" with distinct outlines, a dark, "resinoid" nucleus, and a clear "perinuclear halo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Special Stain**: Hells Kolod Iron stain can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

### Bellini Duct (Collecting Duct) RCC

*   Known for having the worst prognosis among RCC types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### Medullary RCC

*   Strongly associated with [[Pathological features of various diseases | sickle cell trait]], not sickle cell anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Glomerular Diseases: Immunofluorescence and Electron Microscopy Locations

Understanding the location of immune complex deposits within the glomerulus helps differentiate various kidney pathologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

### Sub-epithelial Deposits (below podocytes)

*   [[Differential Diagnosis of Kidney Pathologies | Post-streptococcal Glomerulonephritis]] (PSGN): Often seen in children, presents with a "starry sky appearance" on immunofluorescence and "sub-epithelial humps" on electron microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.
*   [[Differential Diagnosis of Kidney Pathologies | Membranous Glomerulonephropathy]] (MGN): More common in elderly individuals, characterized by "spike and dome pattern" on silver stain and sub-epithelial deposits on electron microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.

### Mesangial Deposits (in the middle region)

*   [[Differential Diagnosis of Kidney Pathologies | Berger's Disease]] (IgA Nephropathy): Characterized by IgA deposits in the mesangium, sometimes showing a "loopy" pattern on immunofluorescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.

### Intra-membranous Deposits (within the basement membrane)

*   Dense Deposit Disease (DDD) / MPGN Type 2: The entire glomerular basement membrane appears densely black on electron microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

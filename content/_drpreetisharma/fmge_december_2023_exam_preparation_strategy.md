Following the declaration of the FMG results, a new session is held to provide a [[daily_study_schedule_for_fmge | timetable]] and [[fmge_preparation_strategy | strategy]] for the upcoming [[FMGE December 2024 exam preparation strategy | December 2023 exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Aspirants have approximately three months to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Mindset and Motivation

It is normal to feel anxious, but remember that the December 2023 exam offers another chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. It's crucial to find a positive outlook and maintain a ray of hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Avoid thinking about the June 2024 session and focus entirely on clearing the December attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Do not put unnecessary pressure on yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This exam is not the end of life, nor is it your first or last failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. Approach your studies with a positive mindset and a smile, remembering, "It's not over until you win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

It is recommended to write down your desired score and purpose for studying, placing it where you can see it daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. This serves as a constant reminder and motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

## Overall [[exam_preparation_strategy_for_fmge | Exam Preparation Strategy]]

### Study Hours and Time Management
*   Aim for 12 to 14 hours of study daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   It's not about studying all night or abandoning social media, but optimizing time with your books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Syllabus Completion: The 46-Day Plan
The goal is to finish notes, videos, and MCQs within three months, allowing for at least two to three revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The initial 46 days should be dedicated to completing the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Rapid Revision vs. Main Videos
For efficient syllabus completion in 45-50 days, focus on rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Watching main videos for all 19 subjects is not practically possible within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Engage with rapid revision first. If a concept is unclear, jump to the specific relevant section in the main video, understand it, and then return to rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Exceptions**: For subjects like OBG (Obstetrics and Gynecology) and PSM (Community Medicine), which account for many questions (40+), it is advisable to watch the main videos if time permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Importance of MCQs and PYQs
*   **Mandatory**: Solving MCQs side-by-side with theoretical study is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Sources**:
    *   For topic-wise questions, FMG Solutions is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   For app-based PYQs, Prepladder is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    *   The current [[fmg_exam_preparation | FMG exam]] questions are very clinical, so clinical question banks are crucial for practicing lengthy questions and [[time_management_techniques_for_fmge | time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Previous year questions (PYQs) mainly cover fact-based, one-liner questions and help identify important topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Number of Questions**: Students should aim to solve around 100-150 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. Start with 50 questions if needed and gradually increase by 5-7 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.
*   **PYQ Specifics**:
    *   For FMG, solve the last 5 years' papers (10 sessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.
    *   For NEET PG, minimum 3 years' papers are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. If time permits, extend to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.
    *   For INI-CET, prioritize FMG papers first, then NEET, and finally current INI-CET papers (March and November sessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. Watch YouTube recall sessions for INI-CET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.

### Revision Strategy
*   After finishing the syllabus, revisions should primarily involve notes, not videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   Videos should only be opened if a concept is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   Your notes should be very close to you, constantly revisited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) and Score Improvement
*   Start by taking a Grand Test to establish a baseline score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   Don't expect massive jumps overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. Aim for small, gradual improvements of 5-10 marks in each subsequent GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.
*   Analyze your GTs to identify weak subjects. Focus on revising these subjects more aggressively before taking the next GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

### Source Selection
Stick to the study materials and platforms you've already been using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. Do not change your sources at this critical point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. Minor additions to your notes from new information are acceptable, but a complete platform change is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>. Choose sources that suit your learning style, not necessarily what your friends are using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

## Specific Subject Advice

*   **OBG and PSM**: These subjects carry significant weight (40+ questions each). If possible, watch their main videos; otherwise, ensure thorough rapid revision and MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Medicine**: Due to its vastness, Medicine can be daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Instead of dedicating a full week, study Medicine for one hour daily as a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This ensures consistent progress and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects (Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Microbiology)**: These subjects are often feared due to their tendency to be forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. The key is to read their rapid revision notes repeatedly until you are an expert and can recall specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
    *   Rapid revision for Pathology and Microbiology is 100% sufficient for FMG and NEET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

## Practical Study Tips

*   **Offline Coaching**: If attending offline coaching, follow their timetable. However, ensure you revise the day's topics every evening or the next morning before class to avoid backlogs. Active learning is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.
*   **Active Recall**: Instead of passively listening, actively test yourself. Cover answers in your notes and try to recall them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. If studying with a friend, ask each other questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. This builds confidence and identifies gaps in understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.
*   **Bookmarking Questions**: During practice, selectively bookmark only the questions you consistently forget or find challenging. Avoid bookmarking too many, as this defeats the purpose of focused revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
*   **Screenshots**: If you take screenshots of important information, create a dedicated folder on your phone and organize them by subject. Avoid accumulating thousands of screenshots, as they often remain unreviewed and become useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
*   **Offline Coaching**: If you are following an offline coaching, follow their timetable for the classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. However, it's essential to revise what's taught every day to prevent backlogs. Don't just passively listen in class; actively engage with the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

*   Don't be disheartened by past results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. The exam pattern changes and increased clinical questions in July 2023 were a new challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>.
*   The December exam will likely be easier or at the same difficulty level, as you've already experienced the peak of toughness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   The key is to repeatedly revise and solve many questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

## Conclusion

Maintain a positive outlook, visualize your success, and dedicate yourself fully for the next three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. Your hard work and focused [[utilizing_previous_year_question_papers_for_fmge | strategy]] will lead to success in the December 2023 exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.

[[Appendicitis and appendix histology | Appendicitis]] is a condition that can be identified through various diagnostic methods, including imaging and histological examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Imaging Findings
In a clinical case, imaging can show an enlarged appendix, which often prompts an appendectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Histological Diagnosis of Appendicitis
For a definitive diagnosis of acute [[appendicitis_and_appendix_histology | appendicitis]] via [[visual_and_histological_pathology_clues_for_diagnosis | histopathology]], pathologists look for the presence of neutrophilsâ€”cells characteristic of acute inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Crucially, these neutrophils must be observed in the muscularis propria, or muscle layer, of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Differentiating Acute Appendicitis from Peri-Appendicitis
If the inflammation, specifically a dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate, is seen only in the serosa (the outermost layer) of the appendix, it indicates peri-appendicitis, not acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Peri-appendicitis means that inflammation from a surrounding area has extended onto the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

A common cause of peri-appendicitis in females is [[salpingitis_and_appendix_relation | salpingitis]], an inflammation of the fallopian tube, which can extend to the appendix's serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

If the appendix is perforated, a proper muscle layer would not be visible in the histological examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

### Role of *Enterobius vermiculitis*
*Enterobius vermiculitis* (also known as pinworm) is an organism that can be found in the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It is histologically identified by two lateral cuticular alae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. While *Enterobius vermiculitis* is usually an incidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, it can very occasionally cause [[appendicitis_and_appendix_histology | appendicitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The classical clinical feature associated with *Enterobius vermiculitis* is perianal itching or pruritus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Microbiological Diagnostics for *Enterobius vermiculitis*
In [[diagnostics_in_pathology_and_microbiology | microbiology]], the eggs of *Enterobius vermiculitis* are described as plano-convex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Inside these eggs, a tadpole larva can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The cellulose tape method (or tape preparation) is the technique used to collect these eggs for examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. These eggs can also be seen under ultraviolet light or with a Pap stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

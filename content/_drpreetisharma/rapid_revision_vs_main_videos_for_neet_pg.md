For [[NEET PG 2025 planning and strategy | NEET PG 2025]] preparation, students often choose between rapid revision videos and comprehensive main videos. The optimal choice depends on the student's current preparation level, available time, and learning style.

## Understanding the Resources

### Rapid Revision (RR) Videos
Rapid Revision videos are designed for quick and consolidated learning.
*   **Duration:** Typically shorter, e.g., Pathology is roughly 20 hours and Microbiology is about 15 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Content:** The content covered in RR videos is largely the same as main videos, but presented in a more consolidated and faster manner, often using tables for quick memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. For example, ovarian tumors might be covered in 20 minutes with three tables in RR compared to a 2-hour main video lecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   **Versions:** Different versions exist (e.g., RR 5.0, RR 6.0), with minimal additional content in newer versions (e.g., 2-3 hours extra in RR 6.0 Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Suitability:**
    *   **Prior Viewers:** If you have already seen RR 5.0, it is recommended to stick to it and scan the PDF for RR 6.0 updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    *   **First-time Viewers:** If you have never viewed the videos, start directly with RR 6.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
    *   **Working Doctors/Interns:** Highly recommended due to time constraints, as completing main videos while working 6-8 hours a day is nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Rely predominantly on RR, and only refer to main videos for specific topics you don't understand (e.g., heart sounds, ECG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
    *   **Overcoming Conceptual Gaps:** If starting with RR and encountering concepts you don't understand, pause the RR video, refer to the corresponding main video for that specific topic, and then return to RR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

### Main Videos
Main videos offer comprehensive coverage of subjects.
*   **Duration:** Significantly longer than RR videos, e.g., Pathology main videos can take at least 10 days to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Suitability:**
    *   **First Revision/First-time Test Takers:** If you are a fresher or giving the exam for the first time, starting with subjects covered comprehensively (subject-wise) rather than system-wise is advised for the first read or revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   **Specific Subjects:** For subjects like Ophthalmology where you might have difficulty, main videos are recommended if you are "very bad" at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
    *   **Interns/Working Doctors:** Not practical for daily study if working for 6-8 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## Strategy for Integration and Usage

### Pathology & Microbiology
*   It is recommended to use [[Rapid Revision Techniques for FMGE | rapid revision]] videos for Pathology (roughly 20 hours) and Microbiology (roughly 15 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   After watching the rapid revision videos for Path and Micro, you should be able to solve 85-90% of the main QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   It is generally not necessary to fall back on main notes after watching RR videos for these subjects, as RR notes are consolidated and help in faster revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

### Medicine
*   Medicine is a vast subject; attempting to finish it in one stretch (5-15 days) is often ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   A suggested approach is to dedicate 1 to 1.5 hours to Medicine every day, treating it like a "clinical posting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   This daily approach makes the subject less toxic and allows for integration with other subjects (e.g., studying cardiac system alongside Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   This strategy requires discipline, ideally fixing a specific time like 10 PM daily for Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

### Anatomy
*   For students finding Anatomy overwhelming, it's advised to study it with allied subjects like Orthopedics, Surgery, and Radiology. These subjects will repeatedly reinforce Anatomy concepts, aiding memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

### General Recommendations
*   **Revision Process:**
    *   The first reading/revision can be comprehensive (e.g., using main videos or detailed notes).
    *   Subsequent revisions should narrow down content, transitioning from rapid revision to filtered topics, eventually focusing only on volatile topics in the final 10-15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
    *   [[Effective use of Rapid Revision and main video resources | Passive learning]] from videos is primarily for understanding; after that, active recall using notes and MCQs is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   **Customization:** The suggested 65-day plan is a template. Interns or working doctors may need to add 2-3 extra days for long subjects and 1 day for short subjects to accommodate their schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, as individual circumstances require personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   **Source Consistency:** Stick to one primary source for notes and videos for a particular subject. While minor overlaps or missing information might exist between platforms, the core 90% of content is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. Frequent switching of platforms or notes can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

Managing your mental state, particularly anxiety and maintaining positivity, is crucial during intensive exam preparation periods, especially in the final days leading up to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This involves strategic planning, sleep regulation, and fostering a supportive environment.

## Combating Anxiety and Panic
The final days before an exam can be "make or break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The pressure can lead to panic and anxiety, especially concerning unfinished syllabi or mock test scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Strategic Subject Management
It's common for students not to have finished all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Instead of panicking, make a list of completed and remaining subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The goal is to know "little by little" about every subject, aiming to correctly answer at least 5 out of 10 questions from any given topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Don't start completely new, extensive topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For left-over subjects, focus on LRR (Last Revision Round) sessions or crash courses (around 3 hours per subject) and previous year questions to cover the basics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Sleep Cycle Normalization
To be alert during the actual exam, normalize your sleep cycle by sleeping during the night and studying during the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. You need to be focused and attentive during morning hours, corresponding to exam times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Aim for a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep to ensure your brain functions optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Avoid sleepless nights or experimenting with medications before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

### Grand Test (GT) Strategy
Giving Grand Tests (GTs) can be a source of anxiety if scores are not as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
If you are confident in handling pressure, you can take GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. However, the primary focus should *not* be on the score (e.g., crossing 150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Instead, use GTs for:
*   [[time_management_during_exams | Time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   Identifying and correcting silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>
*   Practicing solving questions within the given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>

If a GT score is low, analyze *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>:
*   **Silly mistakes**: Practice more MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.
*   **Knowledge gaps**: Quickly review the relevant topics from your LRR notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.

### Managing New Questions in MCQs
Every Grand Test will have 20-30 "bouncer" questions that seem new or unheard of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Don't let these demotivate you; they are designed to prevent overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. Your pass or fail is decided by how you handle known topics and avoid silly mistakes, not by these bouncers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Fostering Positivity and Mental Stability
[[stress_management_and_mindset | Positivity]] is essential to manage anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Curate Your Environment
*   **Talk only to positive people**: Connect with parents, siblings, good friends, and teachers who provide positive vibes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Avoid negative influences**: Stay away from those who boast about their preparations, spread rumors about exam difficulty, or create unnecessary panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Ignore rumors**: Disregard any illogical claims about the exam pattern or difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Maintain Mental Sanity
Allocate at least 30 minutes daily for "sanity time," away from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This could be a light walk, socializing, or even watching reels if it helps you relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This short break helps prevent mental exhaustion and keeps your life feeling normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

### Overcoming Forgetfulness
It's normal to feel like you're forgetting subjects, especially volatile ones like Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. No one can memorize all 19 subjects perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. If you feel like you're forgetting something, pick it up and revise it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Don't let it lead to [[managing_mental_health_during_exam_preparation | depression]] or stop your studies, as one negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

### Focus on the Present
Avoid dwelling on future uncertainties, such as alarm ringing, reaching the exam center, or computer issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. Focus only on what you need to do in the next few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

### Sustaining Focus During the Exam
The exam requires sustained concentration for 3-3.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>. Practice sitting for long durations without breaks or distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>. Your goal is to maintain the same attention, alertness, and mindset for every question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

### Handling Exam Papers
Expect one exam paper to be tough and the other to be easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. If the first paper is tough, disconnect from it during the break and do not discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. Go into the second paper without the "backlog and hangover" of the first, trusting that the balance will lead to passing the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. Remember, competitive exams are a mixture of knowledge and [[balancing_confidence_and_caution_during_exams | mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

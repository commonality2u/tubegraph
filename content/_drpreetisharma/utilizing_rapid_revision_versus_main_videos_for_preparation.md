For NEET PG 2025 aspirants, a 65-day plan is suggested, with flexibility for customization, especially for interns who may need to add 2-3 extra days for long subjects and 1 day for short subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.

## When to Choose Rapid Revision Videos

[[effectiveness_of_rapid_revision_videos_for_exam_preparation | Rapid revision videos]] are highly recommended for efficiency, particularly for subjects like [[pathology_and_rapid_revision_approach | Pathology]] (approximately 20 hours) and Microbiology (approximately 15 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:43">[10:24:43]</a>. If you have previously completed [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | Rapid Revision]] 5.0, it is advised to stick to those notes and not switch to 6.0, though you can check for new topics in the 6.0 PDF file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. If you are new to the videos, starting directly with RR 6.0 is the best approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

[[effectiveness_of_rapid_revision_videos_for_exam_preparation | Rapid revision]] notes are also beneficial for quicker revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>. The content in [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | rapid revision]] videos is consolidated, often presenting extensive main video content in a faster, more summarized format (e.g., two hours of ovarian tumors summarized into 20 minutes with tables) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. This approach can help students solve 85-90% of questions from the main Q Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>.

### Specific Cases for Rapid Revision

*   **Working Doctors & Interns**: For those with limited study time (e.g., working 6-8 hours a day), completing main videos is nearly impossible unless dedicating 12 hours daily to studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>. In such cases, [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | rapid revision]] should be the primary resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>.
*   **First-Time Learners**: If you are starting your preparation with no prior reading, begin with [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | rapid revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Main Video Completion**: If you have completed main videos long ago for a subject like Ophthalmology, shifting to [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | rapid revision]] for subsequent review is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:53:00">[30:53:00]</a>.

## When to Utilize Main Videos

Main videos are much bulkier and require significantly more time; for instance, [[pathology_and_rapid_revision_approach | Pathology]] main videos would take at least 10 days to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

### Strategic Use of Main Videos

*   **Targeted Deep Dive**: If you are studying with [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | rapid revision]] and encounter a topic that you don't understand, pause the rapid revision video, open the corresponding main video, review that specific topic, and then return to [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | rapid revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>. This approach helps in strengthening weak concepts without getting bogged down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.
*   **Severe Weakness in a Subject**: If you are "very bad" at a subject like Ophthalmology, it might be beneficial to do the main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>.
*   **Passive Learning Loop**: While videos are crucial for initial understanding, relying solely on them for repeated revisions (especially if watched within the last 6 months) can lead to overconfidence. After initial viewing (once or twice), prioritize your notes and active recall. Revisit videos only for topics you genuinely cannot understand from your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>.

## QBank and Revision Approach

*   **QBank Selection**: If you are doing your first round of revision, it's advised to complete the full Q Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>.
*   **GT Analysis**: If you have watched all main videos but your Grand Test (GT) scores are low, it often indicates a lack of proper revision rather than a problem with the main videos themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56:00">[33:56:00]</a>. Main videos are bulky, and without consistent revision, the knowledge might not stick. In such cases, either revise your main notes or transition to [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | rapid revision]] for faster recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09:00">[34:09:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the choice between [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_exam_preparation | rapid revision]] and main videos depends on your individual preparation stage, time availability, and comfort with the subjects. The key is to be disciplined in your approach, analyze your weak areas, and adjust your strategy accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

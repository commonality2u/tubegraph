[[hpv_and_cervical_carcinoma | Human Papillomavirus (HPV)]] is a virus frequently associated with invasive cancers, particularly those of the cervix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. While not every HPV infection leads to cancer, certain high-risk types are known to contribute to its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Mechanism of Carcinogenesis

The primary mechanism by which [[hpv_and_cervical_carcinoma | HPV]] causes cancer is through the inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Specifically, two key HPV proteins, E6 and E7, target critical tumor suppressor genes:
*   **E6 protein** inactivates the P-53 gene (often referred to as the "policeman" gene) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **E7 protein** inactivates the RB gene (often referred to as the "governor" gene) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

The P-53 and RB genes are vital tumor suppressor genes, and their inactivation removes critical checkpoints that prevent uncontrolled cell growth, thereby leading to cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Types of [[hpv_and_cervical_carcinoma | HPV]] and Associated Conditions

[[hpv_and_cervical_carcinoma | HPV]] is categorized into low-risk and high-risk types:
*   **Low-risk HPVs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>:
    *   Include types 6 and 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
    *   Primarily cause warts, also known as condyloma accuminatum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **High-risk HPVs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>:
    *   Include types 16 and 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
    *   Are the most common types causing squamous cell carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## [[hpv_and_cervical_carcinoma | HPV]] Characteristics

[[hpv_and_cervical_carcinoma | HPV]] is a DNA virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Key proteins within its structure have specific roles:
*   **L1 capsid protein:** This outermost protein is utilized in the production of [[hpv_and_cervical_carcinoma | HPV]] vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **E4 and E5 proteins:** These proteins are responsible for the formation of a characteristic histological finding associated with [[hpv_and_cervical_carcinoma | HPV]] infection, the **koilocyte** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Koilocyte Morphology
Koilocytes are a hallmark finding in [[hpv_and_cervical_carcinoma | Pap smear]]s indicating [[hpv_and_cervical_carcinoma | HPV]] infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. They are characterized by:
*   A very shriveled, dried-up nucleus, often described as a "raisinoid nucleus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   A distinct clear space or "perinuclear halo" surrounding the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
These two features together define a koilocyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

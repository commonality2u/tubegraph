Preparing for the FMG exam can be daunting, especially in the final days when anxiety can make it difficult to study on your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This article compiles advice and techniques to help you manage your studies and mental state during this crucial period.

## Managing Exam Anxiety

A primary purpose of these sessions is not only to impart knowledge but also to ease your nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. [[time_management_and_exam_anxiety | Keeping your nerves calm]] is paramount, even more so than just mugging up past year questions (PYQs) or Last Run Revision (LRR) material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

With admit cards out, palpitations may increase, but it's crucial to calm yourself down first to be able to study effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

WARNING

Do not get overconfident, and avoid creating unnecessary panic, as it can make you forget what you've already learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. Everyone is in the same boat, experiencing similar fears and feeling like they've forgotten everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

## Effective Study and Revision Strategies

### Focus on Last Run Revision (LRR)
In the final days leading up to the exam, main video lectures are no longer relevant, and even general [[rapid_revision_techniques_and_subject_prioritization | rapid revision videos]] might be too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The focus should be on "Last Run Revision" (LRR) sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. For **FMGE rapid revision techniques**, specifically for FMG, it's recommended to watch the November and December LRR sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

### Passive Learning
If you find yourself unable to study effectively on your own, [[active_recall_and_study_techniques | passive learning]] is recommended. This means sitting in any class or session to absorb knowledge, even if you're not actively self-studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Session Engagement
During live sessions, the pace will be fast due to the extensive material to cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. It's crucial to avoid asking miscellaneous doubts in the middle of the session; save them for the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The goal is to maximize the concentrated material provided for exam-going students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Tip: Don't re-revise the content covered in these specific sessions immediately afterward. Once you've studied with the instructor, consider it done for that topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Mindset for Exam Day
When you encounter a question in the exam, focus entirely on that question. Your mind will automatically recall relevant information without getting distracted by the remaining syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. Trust that your brain will work in a tunnel vision when it needs to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

### Final Days Schedule
The last two to three days before the exam are critical for your mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. It's about maintaining a composed state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.

Tip: Create a timetable for yourself. Dedicate most of your time to studying, but also factor in an hour for sleep, rest, or an outdoor walk for relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.

Teachers are trying to hold daily sessions because studying alone can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. Joining these sessions can help you stay on track and realize that many others are also experiencing similar [[time_management_and_exam_anxiety | exam anxiety]] and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>.

This article compiles information regarding general and immunopathology topics, class schedules, and study strategies, primarily based on discussions from a parasitic quiz session.

## Upcoming Class Schedule and Topics

Regular Wednesday classes will shift to different days due to new commitments in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A timetable for classes until the first half of April will be provided and updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

> [!NOTE] New Schedule
> *   The next class after the current parasitic quiz will be a Virology Quiz on Tuesday, March 26th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:58">[01:26:58]</a>.
> *   INI CET LRR for [[pathology_and_microbiology_clinical_mcqs | Path and Micro]] will be held over three days: April 7th, 8th, and 10th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These sessions will focus on specific, highly requested [[basic_pathology_and_microbiology_concepts | Path and Micro]] topics relevant to INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, including flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, bacterial genetics, and meningitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.
> *   A [[pathology_and_microbiology_clinical_mcqs | General Path Mega Quiz]] is scheduled for April 16th, covering Cell Injury, Inflammation, Genetics, and Neoplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
> *   Immunology will be taught in a separate, dedicated class after the [[pathology_and_microbiology_clinical_mcqs | General Path Mega Quiz]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.
> *   All live classes, except for the Prep Ladder LRR sessions (which are at 12 PM), will maintain the usual 11 AM schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

After the INI CET, the "ultra rapid revision" will enter its second phase, increasing from one class per week to potentially two or more classes per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The aim is to complete the Pathology and Immunology sections by April, then focus on Hematology before the May 19th NEET PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:55">[01:24:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## Study Resources and Strategies

> [!INFO] Learning Approach
> For [[basic_pathology_and_microbiology_concepts | Microbiology]], simply reading notes is often insufficient due to its depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. It's recommended to cover 85% of the syllabus through rapid revision videos and the remaining 15% by solving questions from a Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

### Telegram Channel Updates
The daily Telegram quiz will increase from 5 to 7-10 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. These quizzes will include audio descriptions and daily topic-wise descriptions to help students track discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Starting April 1st, short topics from main videos (2-3 topics per day) will be shared, with specific timestamps to avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) from watching entire long videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Drug of Choice Diaries
A "Drug of Choice Diaries" initiative will start on April 1st, featuring daily Telegram flashcards and quizzes for pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This aims to cover all [[diagnostics_in_pathology_and_microbiology | Drug of Choice]] questions in about 20 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Pathology Stains Series
A new series on pathology stains will begin, arranging all stains alphabetically and providing brief (30-second) explanations every alternate day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Key Concepts and Quizzes

The session covered a [[parasitology_quiz_and_general_pathology_quizzes | 15-question parasitic quiz]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Participants are encouraged to track their scores to monitor improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Parasitic Quiz Highlights

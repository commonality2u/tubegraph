[[gram_positive_bacilli_overview | Gram Positive Bacilli]] include various bacteria, and `Bacillus anthracis` is a significant one, known for causing anthrax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. It is a Gram-positive bacillus that grows as long chains, giving it a distinctive "bamboo stick" or "boxcar" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.

## Key Characteristics and Virulence Factors

*   **Spore-forming:** `Bacillus anthracis` is a [[sporeforming_bacteria_bacillus_and_clostridium | spore-forming organism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. Spores appear as white holes within the bacteria when stained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. Special stains for spores include Schaefer and Fulton stain and Modified Ash Be stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Aerobic:** `Bacillus anthracis` is an aerobic organism, requiring oxygen to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.
*   **Virulence Factors:** `Bacillus anthracis` possesses unique [[virulence_factors_in_bacteria | virulence factors]]:
    *   **Capsule:** Unlike most bacteria with polysaccharide capsules, `Bacillus anthracis` has a [[virulence_factors_of_bacillus_anthracis | polypeptide or poly-D-glutamic acid capsule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>. This capsule can be visualized using Polychrome Methylene Blue stain, which shows purple material around the bacteria, known as the Mc Fadyean reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.
    *   **Anthrax Toxin:** The [[virulence_factors_of_bacillus_anthracis | anthrax toxin]] is tri-partite (three-part), a unique feature as most toxins are bipartite (two-part) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. The three components are:
        *   **Edema Factor (EF):** Increases cyclic AMP, leading to edema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.
        *   **Protective Factor (PF):** Helps protect the organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.
        *   **Lethal Factor (LF):** Contributes to the pathogen's lethality, making it a bioterrorism agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations ([[types_of_anthrax_and_their_transmission | Types of Anthrax]])

Anthrax presents in three main clinical variations, depending on the route of exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>:

1.  **Hide Porter's Disease ([[types_of_anthrax_and_their_transmission | Cutaneous Anthrax]]):**
    *   Occurs through skin contact with infected animal products or animals, common in animal handlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.
    *   Presents as a very blackish, necrolytic lesion called a "malignant eschar" or "achar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. These lesions typically appear on exposed body parts like the neck, shoulder, or back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

2.  **Sutter's Disease ([[types_of_anthrax_and_their_transmission | Inhalational Anthrax]]):**
    *   Results from inhaling wool fibers or dust containing spores, common in wool industry workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.
    *   Leads to pulmonary symptoms and can cause hemorrhagic mediastinitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.

3.  **Intestinal Anthrax:**
    *   Acquired by ingesting uncooked meat from infected animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
    *   Characterized by hemorrhagic enteritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.

> All forms of anthrax are characterized by their hemorrhagic (bleeding) nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

## Laboratory Diagnosis

### Culture Media Appearances
*   **Nutrient Agar:** Shows a "Medusa head" appearance, resembling frizzy hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.
*   **Penicillin Agar:** Exhibits a "string of pearls" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   **Blood Agar:** Can show a "comet tail" appearance (small tail coming from each colony), "beaten egg" appearance (thick, stringy liquid), or "frosted glass" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.

### Gelatin Stab Test
This test is performed by stabbing a plain wire (not a loop) into gelatin agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>.
*   `Bacillus anthracis`, being aerobic, liquefies the gelatin at the surface where oxygen is present, but not at the bottom. This results in an "inverted fir tree" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>.
    *   > [!contrast] Comparison with Clostridium tetani
        > In contrast, `Clostridium tetani` (which is anaerobic) shows a "straight fir tree" appearance because it liquefies the gelatin throughout, irrespective of oxygen presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

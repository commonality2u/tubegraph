### Admit Card
Ensure your admit card is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It is important to note that you do not need to paste a photograph onto the admit card, as this instruction has been communicated via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Valid ID Proof
A valid ID proof is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It is critical to verify that the name printed on your ID proof exactly matches the name on your admit card, with no spelling mistakes or discrepancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Accessibility and Location
Keep your ID at a well-accessible place to ensure it is not lost or misplaced on the morning of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Additionally, confirm the exact location of your exam center in advance to prevent any last-minute travel issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

> [!tip] Final Prep
> Prepare your documents the evening before the exam day, ideally wrapping up studies by 7:00 or 7:30 PM to settle down and ensure a good night's sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Exam Centre Arrival
It is advised to reach the exam center well in advance of the entry time, which starts at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM for Paper One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Arriving early allows time for your heart rate to normalize before the exam begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Similarly, ensure timely presence for Paper Two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

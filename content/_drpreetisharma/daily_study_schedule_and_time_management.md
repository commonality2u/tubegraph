Dr. Preeti Sharma offers a comprehensive plan and strategy for the upcoming December 2024 FMGE exam, applicable to both first-time test-takers and those who did not cross the 150-score mark in the June-July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Overall Study Plan Structure

The proposed [[time_management_and_timetable_creation_for_fmge | timetable]] spans 60 days, from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This initial 60-day phase focuses on syllabus completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Following this, a revision plan is outlined:
*   Revision 1: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Revision 2: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Revision 3: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

This brings the total preparation roughly to December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The exact revision plan may be rearranged once the exam date is confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Key Study Components

To succeed in the FMGE, the emphasis is on two primary components: theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **MCQ Practice**
    *   Aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Gradually increase the number if you are not currently practicing that many (e.g., increase by 15-20 per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Study Hours**
    *   Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Finishing the syllabus within the 60-day timeframe is crucial for the subsequent revision phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   The key to cracking the exam lies in the number of revisions and daily MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Study Material Source**
    *   Utilize a single source for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This may involve mixing and matching faculties or notes from different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Video Lectures**
    *   For stronger subjects (where you score above 80% in your Q bank), refer to rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   For weaker subjects or topics (scoring less than 80% in your Q bank), refer to main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   For Pathology and Microbiology, it is recommended to use only rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
        *   Pathology rapid revision is approximately 19 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, while Microbiology is 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
        *   This translates to about 5 hours of video lectures per day for these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Videos can be watched at 1.5x or 1.75x speed, with Pathology even at 2x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Grand Tests

Two Grand Tests (GTs) are incorporated into the 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Each GT requires one full day for taking the test and reviewing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **GT 1:** September 8th (even if only 15 out of 19 subjects are covered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>
*   **GT 2:** September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>

The [[time_management_and_timetable_creation_for_fmge | timetable]] starts on July 24th and concludes on September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. It emphasizes moving past previous struggles and focusing on the present journey, avoiding past guilt or future anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule

A structured [[daily_study_schedule_for_fmge | daily_study_schedule_for_fmge]] is crucial for effective [[time_management_and_timetable_creation_for_fmge | time management]] and maintaining consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The concept of "time boxing" is key: dividing time into study, break, and chill sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

*   **Morning Routine (1 hour)**
    *   Wake up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   Enjoy your morning routine; include 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

*   **Study Session 1 (3 hours)**
    *   8:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Sit at your study table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This session prepares you for the exam duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

*   **Short Break (30 minutes)**
    *   11:00 AM - 11:30 AM: Relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Avoid social media or studies during this time; close your eyes, listen to music, talk to family/friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

By lunchtime, you've completed 5.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

*   **Mega Break (1.5 hours)**
    *   2:00 PM - 3:30 PM: Lunch and relaxation. Take a power nap or use social media/watch something of your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

*   **Study Session 3 (2.5 hours)**
    *   3:30 PM - 6:00 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

*   **Good Break (1 hour)**
    *   6:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Mix of rest and social interaction (e.g., 20 mins rest, 30-40 mins talking to friends or social media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

*   **Study Session 4 (2 hours)**
    *   7:00 PM - 9:00 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

*   **Daily MCQ Practice (30 minutes)**
    *   After 9:00 PM: Create a custom module of 30 mixed questions from subjects finished that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This helps stay in touch with past subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

*   **Wind Down and Sleep (until 11:00-11:30 PM)**
    *   Chill, use social media, watch web series (e.g., 20 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
    *   Aim for 8 hours of sleep, waking up by 7:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

This schedule provides approximately 10 hours of study time with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### Mantras for Preparation

*   **"No past guilt, no future anxiety"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Focus on the present 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **"This too shall pass"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

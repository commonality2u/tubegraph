Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is strongly associated with invasive cancer, particularly cervical cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. The primary mechanism by which HPV causes cancer is through the inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Key HPV Proteins and their Role in Carcinogenesis

Two viral proteins, E6 and E7, are responsible for causing cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **E6 protein** inactivates the P-53 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The P-53 gene is often referred to as the "policeman" due to its role in regulating cell growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   **E7 protein** inactivates the RB gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The RB gene is known as the "governor" because it controls cell cycle progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

Both P-53 and RB genes are tumor suppressor genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. By inactivating these genes, HPV effectively removes the brakes on cell proliferation, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and, eventually, cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

## HPV Types and Associated Conditions

HPV can be categorized into two main types based on their risk of causing cancer:
*   **Low-risk HPVs** (e.g., types 6 and 11) typically cause warts, also known as condyloma accuminatum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   **High-risk HPVs** (e.g., types 16 and 18) are primarily responsible for squamous cell carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Types 16 and 18 are the most common high-risk HPVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Histopathological Feature: Koilocytosis

A characteristic histopathological finding in HPV infection is the presence of **koilocytes** in a Pap smear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Koilocytes are described by two main features:
*   A shriveled, raisin-like nucleus (referred to as a "raisenoid nucleus") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   A clear, whitish area around the nucleus, known as a perinuclear halo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

Koilocytes are formed by the E4 and E5 proteins of the HPV virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## HPV Vaccine Development

The L1 capsid protein of HPV is utilized for making the HPV vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

As the final day of the exam approaches, it's natural to experience panic, an increased heart rate, and palpitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This guide offers essential advice for managing pre-exam anxiety and strategic approaches for the examination day, emphasizing mindset and practical tips.

## Pre-Exam Day Guidance

### Wrapping Up Studies and Rest
On the day before the exam, aim to conclude all studying by 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This allows time to settle down, ease anxieties, and ensure a good night's sleep, which is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

For those still wishing to review, prioritize your own "volatile list" of topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. If you don't have such a list or are unsure what to focus on, consider scanning images from subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Orthopedics, and Radiology, as their visual questions are often classical spotters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Avoid pulling an all-nighter or studying subjects like Medicine at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. If you have [[role_of_rapid_revision_in_FMGE_success | Rapid Revision (LRR) videos]] or PDFs, you can briefly review them, but avoid attempting to understand new content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### [[essential_exam_day_checklist_for_FMGE | Essential Exam Day Checklist]]
Before the exam, confirm you have:
*   **Admit Card** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Valid ID Proof**: Ensure the name on your ID matches the name on your admit card without any spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Do not paste a photograph on the admit card unless specifically instructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Keep your ID in an easily accessible place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Exam Centre Location**: Verify the exact location of your exam centre well in advance to avoid last-minute rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Exam Day Logistics

### Arrival and Entry
Entry for Paper 1 typically starts at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Plan to arrive well in time to allow yourself to settle down and let your heart rate normalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

### Managing Breaks Between Papers
During the break between Paper 1 and Paper 2, it is crucial to:
*   **Avoid Discussions**: Do not sit and chat or discuss questions from Paper 1. This can unnecessarily stress you if you discover a missed or wrongly answered question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Post-exam recall sessions will be available, but do not engage in them during the break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Eat Light**: Consume something light that provides energy for Paper 2, focusing on nutrition rather than studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## [[exam_preparation_strategies | Exam Strategy]] and Mindset

### Paper Difficulty and Scoring
Based on observed trends, one paper is typically easier, and the other is more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Do not be disheartened if Paper 1 feels tough; Paper 2 might be comparatively easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. The goal is to clear the minimum threshold of 150 marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

### Handling Difficult Questions
Expect 10-20 "bouncer" questions in each paper that are designed to be challenging and may even stump experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. These questions are not meant for everyone to solve and serve to maintain the exam's screening level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. Do not dwell on them, as they can demotivate you. If you encounter a series of tough questions, mark an answer (e.g., A, B, C, D) and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Focus on the other questions where you can avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

### The "Switch On/Switch Off" Mode
For each question, adopt a "switch on, switch off" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Focus solely on the current question, attempt it, then switch off your thoughts about it and move to the next. Avoid thinking about past questions or future questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This helps maintain focus and prevent self-doubt from previous answers from affecting subsequent ones.

### Importance of Avoiding Silly Mistakes
Silly mistakes in easy questions are more regrettable than getting tough questions wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. While some human error is inevitable, ensure panic and anxiety don't amplify these errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

### Positive Mindset and Self-Belief
Approach the exam with a positive mindset. Count your blessings and believe that nothing bad will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. Negative thinking can lead to more silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. From now until the end of the exam, avoid negative thoughts entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Trust in your preparation and your abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. Your first gut feeling is often correct, especially when pressure is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

### Trusting Your Gut Feeling and Avoiding Overthinking
Overthinking creates problems in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. When analyzing a question, spend about 45 seconds, mark your answer, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. Avoid changing many answers in the last few minutes out of panic, as your first gut feeling is usually right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

### Pacing the Exam
The exam paper will be balanced, with a mix of one-liner questions and lengthier ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Some image-based questions may be solved quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. While a general goal is to solve questions in about 50 seconds, do not worry if a lengthy question takes more time; quicker questions will balance it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. It's normal to feel a bit slower in the first 15 minutes of the exam as you settle in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Final Encouragement

Remember, you are already a doctor in essence; the exam is merely a formality to gain the legal recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. You have faced many challenges in life, and this exam is just another small one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Your self-worth is not defined by this single piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Your teachers and parents know you have worked hard and will stand by you regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Disregard the opinions of those who may judge you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Stay confident, pray to whoever or whatever you believe in, and approach the exam with a sane and practical mind. Read every question and option carefully, even if it seems familiar, to avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. If an option is not immediately clear, try to rule out incorrect ones to arrive at the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

All the best for your exam!

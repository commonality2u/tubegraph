This article discusses a daily multiple-choice question (MCQ) focusing on the diagnosis of [[appendicitis_and_differential_diagnosis | appendicitis]] and related conditions, particularly based on histological findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This serves as a [[case_studies_and_diagnostic_challenges | case study]] to illustrate key diagnostic criteria in [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | pathology]].

## The MCQ Scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>

A 17-year-old girl presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, described as crampy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. [[medical_imaging_in_pathology_and_microbiology | Imaging]] shows an enlarged appendix, leading to an appendicectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Histological examination reveals a dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate observed in the serosa of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

**Question:** What is the likely diagnosis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>

**Options:**
*   Perforation appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>
*   Acute [[appendicitis_and_differential_diagnosis | appendicitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>
*   Acute salpingitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>
*   Inflammatory bowel disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>

## Diagnosis and Explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>

The correct answer to the MCQ is **Acute salpingitis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### Histological Criteria for Acute Appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>

For a definitive [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | diagnosis]] of [[appendicitis_and_differential_diagnosis | acute appendicitis]] by a pathologist, the presence of neutrophils (cells of acute inflammation) must be observed specifically in the **muscularis propria** (muscle layer) of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. If neutrophils are seen only in other layers, such as the serosa, it changes the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

### Peri-appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>

When inflammation, characterized by neutrophilic infiltrate, is found primarily in the **serosa** (the outermost layer) of the appendix, this indicates [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | peri-appendicitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Peri-appendicitis means that inflammation from a *surrounding* organ or tissue has extended onto the appendix, rather than originating within the appendix itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

### Ruling Out Other Options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>

*   **Acute [[appendicitis_and_differential_diagnosis | appendicitis]]**: This is ruled out because the inflammation is described as being in the serosa, not the muscularis propria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Perforation appendix**: In a perforated appendix, the muscle layer would not be properly seen, as it would be disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. The question implies an intact muscle layer with inflammation limited to the serosa.
*   **Inflammatory bowel disease**: This was not discussed as a differential in this context.

### The Role of Salpingitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>

In females, one of the very common causes of [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | peri-appendicitis]] is [[medical_advice_and_classifications | salpingitis]], which is the inflammation of the fallopian tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. Inflammation from the fallopian tube can extend to the serosa of the adjacent appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Therefore, the histological finding of serosal inflammation points to a diagnosis of acute salpingitis as the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and the apparent enlargement of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

<div class="callout warning">
While *Enterobius vermicularis* (pinworm) can be found in the appendix lumen and is usually an incidental finding, it *occasionally* causes [[appendicitis_and_differential_diagnosis | acute appendicitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. However, the MCQ specifically asks about the diagnosis based on the *location* of the neutrophilic infiltrate, making *Enterobius vermicularis* not the direct answer for this specific histological scenario.

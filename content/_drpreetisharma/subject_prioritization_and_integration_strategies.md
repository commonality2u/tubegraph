A structured approach to subject prioritization and integration is crucial for success in the FMGE December 2024 exam, especially given the diverse syllabus and the need for efficient [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | exam preparation]]. This strategy focuses on a 60-day intensive study period followed by multiple [[revision_plan_and_strategies_for_fmge | revisions]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>

## The 60-Day Study Plan: July 24th - September 21st

This initial 60-day timetable aims to cover the entire syllabus, focusing on both theory and MCQs. It commences on July 24th and concludes on September 21st, preparing students for subsequent [[revision_plan_and_strategies_for_fmge | revision phases]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

### Core Components
*   **Duration:** 60 days of focused study. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Daily Study Hours:** An average of 8 to 10 hours per day is recommended to ensure syllabus completion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   **MCQ Practice:** 100 to 120 MCQs per day. If starting from a lower number, gradually increase daily practice by 15-20 questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   **Single Source Principle:** Maintain a single, consistent source for each subject to avoid confusion and ensure focused study. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>

### Strategic Subject Blocks and Integration

The subjects are divided into four blocks, emphasizing interlinked topics to facilitate integrated learning and better retention. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>

#### Block 1: Foundational Clinical Sciences
*   **Anatomy:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>
*   **Surgery:** 6 days (integrated with Anatomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
*   **Orthopedics (Ortho):** 2 days (integrated with Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   **Radiology:** 2 days (to wrap up surgical branches, correlating with X-rays, CT scans from Surgery and Ortho) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>

#### Block 2: Basic Sciences and Medicine
*   **Pathology:** 4 days (crucial for a strong hold over medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   **Microbiology (Micro):** 3 days (essential basic science) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   **Pharmacology (Pharma):** 4 days (forms a strong base for medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
*   **Medicine:** 6 days (easier to tackle after Path, Micro, Pharma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   **Pediatrics:** 2 days (overlaps with many medicine topics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   **Physiology:** 1 day (focus on extra physiologies, leveraging overlap with Medicine's neurophysiology and cardiophysiology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   **Dermatology (Derma):** 1 day (correlates with Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

#### Block 3: Surgical Specialties
*   **Obstetrics & Gynecology (OBGY):** 6 days (a must, given its comprehensive nature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   **Anesthesia:** 2 days (to wrap up surgical branches like OBGY, Surgery, Ortho) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>

#### Block 4: Standalone Subjects
These subjects are often less interlinked but carry their own weight in the exam. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
*   **PSM (Community Medicine):** 5 days (increased time due to rising question difficulty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
*   **Biochemistry:** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
*   **ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat):** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   **Ophthalmology (Ophthal):** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   **FMT (Forensic Medicine & Toxicology):** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   **Psychiatry:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

### Customizing Your Study Plan
While a date-wise plan is provided, students can customize the order of subjects based on their individual strengths and weaknesses, adhering to the allocated number of days per subject. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>

## Leveraging Resources: Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision

The choice between main videos and [[effective_use_of_rapid_revision_and_main_video_resources | Rapid Revision]] videos depends on individual subject proficiency:
*   **Rapid Revision:** Use for subjects where you consistently score above 80% in Q-banks, indicating a strong foundation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
*   **Main Videos:** Opt for subjects or topics where your Q-bank score is below 80%, signifying weaker areas that require in-depth understanding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
*   **Specific Recommendations:** For Pathology and Microbiology, it is explicitly advised to use only Rapid Revision videos (Pathology: 19 hours, Microbiology: 16 hours on PrepLadder). This can be managed by watching videos at accelerated speeds (e.g., 1.5x to 2x). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>

## Integrating Grand Tests for Performance Monitoring

[[utilizing_grand_tests_and_analysis_for_improvement | Grand Tests (GTs)]] are an integral part of the 60-day plan, not just for assessment but also for review:
*   Two full days are allocated specifically for GTs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
*   GT1 is scheduled around September 8th, even if all 19 subjects are not yet covered. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>
*   GT2 is on September 21st, marking the end of the 60-day intensive study phase. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>
*   Each GT day includes both taking the test and thoroughly reviewing it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>

## Daily Subject Retention Strategy

To combat the natural tendency to forget previously studied subjects, incorporate a daily quick revision method:
*   **Nightly Custom Module:** Before sleeping, dedicate 30 minutes to a casual test. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>
*   **Mixed Bag Questions:** Create a custom module of around 30 questions from all subjects completed up to that day. For example, if on day 15 having finished five subjects, include questions from all five. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>
*   **Casual Review:** The goal is not serious bookmarking or note-taking, but simply to stay in touch with past subjects by identifying incorrect answers and understanding the reasons. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>

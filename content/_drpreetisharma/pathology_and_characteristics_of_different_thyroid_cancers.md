Thyroid cancers originate from different cell types within the thyroid gland and exhibit distinct pathological features, genetic alterations, and prognoses.

## Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid (PTC)
[[Pathology Image Identification | Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid]] (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.
*   **Origin** It arises from the follicular epithelial cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:03">[07:01:03]</a>.
*   **Histological Features**
    *   **True Papillae** PTC is characterized by finger-like projections known as papillae. These are "true" papillae because they contain a fibrovascular core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Psammoma Bodies** These are characteristic lamellated calcifications appearing as "blue blue random blue material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:37">[12:37:37]</a>.
    *   **Orphan Annie Eye Nuclei** The nuclei appear white or "optically clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:52">[12:49:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:11">[15:09:11]</a>, resembling the eyes of the cartoon character Orphan Annie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. This finding is an artifact caused by formalin fixation and is seen only on biopsy, not on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Intranuclear Inclusions** Also known as intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions, these appear as pink dots within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:33">[16:31:33]</a>.
    *   **Intranuclear Grooves** These appear as a line going through the nucleus, sometimes described as a "coffee bean appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:42">[16:40:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Chewing Gum Colloid** On FNAC, the colloid may appear stretched or "chewing gum-like" due to its sticky nature when drawn through a thin needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alterations** The most common genetic alteration is the BRAF V600E mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>. The second most common is RET/PTC fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.
*   **Prognosis** PTC has an excellent prognosis with nearly 100% survival rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>.
*   **Associations** It is the most common thyroid cancer associated with radiation exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a> and can follow Hashimoto's thyroiditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>.

## Follicular Thyroid Cancer (FTC)
[[Follicular adenoma and its clinical aspects | Follicular Thyroid Cancer]] also originates from follicular cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:03">[07:01:03]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alterations** The most common genetic alteration is the RAS mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. Other associated mutations include PTEN, PI3K, and PAX8/PPARÎ³ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

## Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC)
MTC arises from the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   **Tumor Marker** Calcitonin is the primary tumor marker for MTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>.
*   **Histological Features** MTC often presents with amyloid deposits, which appear as pink material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. Amyloid can be confirmed by Congo Red stain, which shows apple-green birefringence under a polarizing microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alterations** MTC is associated with RET gene mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>. The mnemonic "RET 10 MEN" helps remember that the RET gene is on chromosome 10 and is associated with Medullary Thyroid Cancer (Med) and Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes (MEN 2A, 2B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:00">[23:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:28:00">[23:28:00]</a>. It's crucial to differentiate RET *mutation* (MTC) from RET/PTC *fusion* (Papillary Carcinoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>. Loss of function of the RET gene can lead to Hirschsprung disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a>.

## Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer (ATC)
[[Pathogenesis of neoplasia and HPV | Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer]] also originates from follicular cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:03">[07:01:03]</a>.
*   **Prognosis** ATC has the worst prognosis among thyroid cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>.

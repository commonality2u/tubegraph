Upcoming quizzes and study materials are scheduled to support preparation for medical exams like NEET PG and INI CET, focusing on pathology and microbiology topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Quiz Schedule and Formats

### Weekly Classes
Weekly classes, previously held on Wednesdays, are shifting to different days, possibly Tuesdays or Thursdays, due to other commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A detailed timetable for classes until the first half of April will be provided, with continuous updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The ongoing series of classes will continue until the last NEET PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The standard time for these classes is 11 AM, except for Prep Ladder LRR sessions, which are at 12 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Specific Quizzes and Sessions
*   **Today's Class:** Featured 15 questions on parasitology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Next Class (March 26th):** A [[Diagnostics in pathology and microbiology|Virology Quiz]] will be held on a Tuesday, replacing the usual Wednesday slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:58">[01:26:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **INI CET Special Topics:** Three sessions in April (4th, 7th, 10th) will cover [[Advanced Pathology and Microbiology Cases|INI CET LRR for Pathology and Microbiology]], focusing on advanced topics like flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, meningitis, and bacterial genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.
*   **General Pathology Mega Quiz:** On April 16th, a [[Basic Pathology and Microbiology Concepts|General Pathology Mega Quiz]] will cover four chapters: cell injury, inflammation, genetics, and neoplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Immunology will be addressed in a separate session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.
*   **Ultra Rapid Revision Phase 2:** After the INI CET, the ultra rapid revision will enter its second phase, increasing class frequency to potentially two classes per week to cover more material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Daily Telegram Quizzes
The daily Telegram quiz will increase from 5 questions to approximately 7 to 10 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. These quizzes will include audio descriptions and daily topic-wise descriptions to guide preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Starting April 1st, "Drug of Choice Diaries" (flashcards and quizzes) and a pathology stains (A-Z series) will also be launched on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Strategies for Quizzes and Revision

### Tracking Progress
Students are encouraged to track their scores in these quizzes to monitor their progress, similar to Grand Test (GT) tracking, aiming for an upward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Approaching Difficult Questions
It's advised not to panic when encountering tough questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. If an image-based question is unclear, students should rely on the clinical history provided, as there will always be guiding lights to help find the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

### Utilizing Q-Bank and Main Videos
For [[Microbiology test preparation strategies|microbiology test preparation]], watching rapid revision videos covers about 85% of the content, with the remaining 15% needing to be covered by practicing questions from any Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. For 2025 aspirants, watching main videos for [[Microbiology introduction and scheduling|microbiology]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>. Short topics from main videos will also be suggested daily for a focused 15-day study plan, with specific timestamps to avoid FOMO (fear of missing out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Several initiatives are run on social media platforms to foster engagement and encourage subscriptions, primarily on Telegram, Facebook, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These efforts aim to provide daily educational content and interactive opportunities.

## Image of the Day Series

A series titled "Image of the Day" is initiated on Telegram and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **Content:** This series focuses on sharing images and their discussions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Another series, "Institute of the Day," involves posting a specific Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) every day at 10:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

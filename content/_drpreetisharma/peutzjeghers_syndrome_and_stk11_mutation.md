[[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and STK11 mutation]] is a condition characterized by two key features: pigmentation and the presence of polypoidal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. The diagnosis is confirmed when these two aspects, particularly the pigmentation and the specific "Christmas tree" or "arborizing" polyp, are identified together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

## Clinical Features
*   **Pigmentation** Patients present with mucosal and cutaneous pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
*   **Age of Presentation** The median age of presentation for [[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and STK11 mutation]] is 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.
*   **Inheritance** The disease follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

## Histopathological Findings
The characteristic histopathological finding from an intestinal biopsy is an "arborizing polyp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. This polyp type is also known as a "Christmas tree polyp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. It is classified as a hamartomatous polyp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

On microscopy, the arborizing pattern is identified by the presence of a pinkish, branching structure, which is muscle, extending between and splitting the glands, resembling the branches of a tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.

## Location
Polyps associated with [[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and STK11 mutation]] are most commonly found in the jejunum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

## Genetic Basis
The gene mutated in [[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and STK11 mutation]] is *STK11* (Serine Threonine Kinase 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>, also known as *LKB1* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. It is important to note that this is a **loss of function** mutation of *STK11* / *LKB1*, not a gain of function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

## Complications
A very common complication in patients with [[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and STK11 mutation]] is intussusception, which can be caused by the polyps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

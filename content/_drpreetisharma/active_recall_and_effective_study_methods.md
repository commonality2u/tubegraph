Preparing for exams effectively involves a combination of strategic planning, consistent effort, and smart study methods. With approximately three months available for preparation, a structured approach is crucial to cover the syllabus, practice questions, and ensure multiple revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## General Study Strategy and Time Management

Success in exam preparation requires significant dedication. Students should aim for 12 to 14 hours of study daily, even if they are starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. While this is a demanding schedule, it allows for effective coverage and practice without needing to stay up all night or completely abandon social life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Developing a Timetable
A well-structured timetable is essential. The goal is to finish the entire syllabus within 46 days, allowing ample time for at least 2-3 revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While it's common for students to struggle with [[developing_effective_timetables_for_exam_preparation | developing effective timetables]], it's important to accept that not every task will be completed daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Focus on achieving 80-85% of daily targets rather than striving for an unattainable 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

Consider prioritizing subjects based on recent exam performance. If specific subjects like OBGY, Pathology, or PSM were problematic in a previous attempt, tackle them first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Active Recall and Learning Methods

There's a significant difference between passive and active learning. Listening to videos or attending classes is considered passive learning, which, while comfortable, is less effective for retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

### What is Active Recall?
[[active_recall_learning_techniques | Active Recall Learning Techniques]] involve actively trying to retrieve information from memory rather than passively re-reading or listening. This method significantly enhances learning and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

**Implementing Active Recall:**
*   **Self-Questioning:** When revising notes, cover the answers and ask yourself questions. Try to recall the information before checking the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Questioning:** If studying with a partner, ask each other questions to test recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
*   **Testing Understanding:** Do not assume understanding just by listening to a video or lecture. Attempt to recall the information without the source to gauge true retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.

Active learning is what truly helps achieve marks in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## Subject-Specific Strategies

### Effective Use of Resources
When aiming to finish the syllabus in 45-50 days, it is generally not feasible to go through all main videos. Prioritize [[effective_use_of_rapid_revision_and_main_video_resources | Rapid Revision videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

**When to use Main Videos:**
*   **Conceptual Gaps:** If a concept is not understood from rapid revision, specifically refer to the relevant section in the main video for clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **High-Yield Subjects:** For subjects like OBGY (Obstetrics and Gynaecology) and PSM (Community Medicine), which account for many questions (40+), consider watching the main videos if time permits, as they are crucial for a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Volatile Subjects
Subjects like Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Microbiology are highly volatile, meaning information is easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

**Strategy for Volatile Subjects:**
*   **Repetitive Rapid Revision:** Instead of exhaustive main video studies, focus on reading the rapid revision notes for these subjects multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **High Accuracy:** Aim for extremely high accuracy in recalling details from these subjects, even to the point of remembering the slide number or layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   [[bacteriology_and_parasitology_study_strategies | Bacteriology and Parasitology study strategies]] heavily rely on this repetitive reading of limited information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Medicine
Medicine is a vast and conceptually challenging subject. A recommended approach is to dedicate one hour to medicine daily as a ritual, integrating it alongside other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. This consistent, integrated study helps build understanding without getting overwhelmed by its vastness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Question Practice and Revision

Solving MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions) side-by-side with theory is a "big yes" and indispensable for exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Source of Questions
*   **FMG Solutions:** For textbook-wise questions, FMG Solutions is a recommended source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Prepladder:** Offers a clinical question bank suitable for practicing questions based on current exam patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Clinical vs. Previous Year Questions:** While previous year questions (PYQs) help identify frequently asked topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, clinical question banks are crucial for practicing lengthy, problem-solving questions typical of recent exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Number of Questions to Solve Daily
Students typically solve between 100 to 150 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. If starting with fewer, gradually increase the number (e.g., 5-7 more questions per day) until reaching the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

### Time Management During Questions
Practice [[time_management_during_exams | time management during exams]] by training to solve lengthy clinical questions within approximately one minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. Identify buzzwords and highlighted points to quickly extract necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.

### Revision Strategy
Once the syllabus is completed, focus on revisions, primarily using notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. Videos should only be revisited if a specific concept is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

**Key aspects of revision:**
*   **Repeated Notes Revision:** Your notes copy should be your closest companion, reviewed again and again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   **Selective Bookmarking:** When solving questions, bookmark only those you genuinely struggle with or know you'll forget. Avoid over-bookmarking, which defeats the purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

## Grand Tests and Performance Improvement

Grand Tests (GTs) are vital for tracking progress and identifying weaknesses.

*   **Baseline GT:** Take a GT at the beginning of the preparation period to establish a baseline score, regardless of how low it might be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Gradual Improvement:** Set small targets for improvement, aiming to increase your score by at least 10 marks in each subsequent GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Analyze Weak Areas:** After each GT, analyze the results to identify subjects where you performed poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. Dedicate revision time to these "disordered areas" before taking the next GT to see improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. This is part of [[postexam_recall_sessions_and_feedback | post-exam recall sessions and feedback]].
*   **Avoid Pressure:** Do not put undue pressure on yourself to achieve a high score from the very first GT; gradual improvement is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Mindset and Motivation

The period after an unfavorable exam result can be traumatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. However, it's crucial to overcome this and proceed with a positive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

*   **Find Your Purpose:** Write down your target score and the purpose behind your intense study (e.g., family, personal dreams, license) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. This purpose should serve as a daily motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.
*   **Embrace Positivity:** Study with a positive attitude and a smile, remembering that "it's not over until you win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.
*   **Persistence:** Failures are a part of life and growth. This exam is just one challenge, and continuous effort will lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   **Stick to Your Source:** Do not change your primary study source (e.g., platform, notes) at this critical stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. Stick with what you have been using and make minor additions as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

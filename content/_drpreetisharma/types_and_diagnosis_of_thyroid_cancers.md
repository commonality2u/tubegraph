Thyroid disorders involve swellings in the anterior neck, often causing discomfort during swallowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The diagnosis and classification of thyroid cancers rely on a combination of clinical presentation, imaging, and especially [[histological_and_cytological_appearances_in_pathology | pathological examination]].

## Normal Thyroid Histology

Normal thyroid tissue consists of follicles lined by follicular epithelial cells, which produce thyroid hormones, and parafollicular C cells, which release calcitonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Thyroid FNAC Adequacy

Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) of the thyroid requires a minimum of six follicles, with each follicle containing at least 10 cells, to be considered adequate for diagnosis (the "Rule of 6/10") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

> [!info] Exceptions to the Rule of 6/10 for FNAC Adequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
> Even if the 6/10 rule is not met, a pathologist may still issue a report if:
> *   There is clear evidence of **malignancy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
> *   It is a case of **colloid goitre**, which yields abundant fluid and few cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
> *   There is **inflammation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Types of Thyroid Cancers

Most thyroid cancers arise from follicular cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid (PTC)

*   **Prevalence:** Most common type of thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Often presents as a solitary, non-tender, firm nodule in the neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Prognosis:** Has an excellent prognosis, with nearly 100% survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Associations:**
    *   Most common thyroid cancer associated with [[pathology_of_thyroid_disorders | radiation exposure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
    *   Can occur following [[pathology_of_thyroid_disorders | Hashimoto's Thyroiditis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

*   **Key Pathological Features (Biopsy/Histology):**
    *   **True Papillae:** Finger-like projections with a fibrovascular core containing blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
    *   **Orphan Annie Eye Nuclei (OAEN):** Optically clear or white nuclei, a formalin-fixation artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. These are seen only on biopsy, not on FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

*   **FNAC Finding:** Often shows "chewing gum colloid," which appears stretched due to the thick colloid getting stuck in the fine needle during aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

### Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer

*   **Prognosis:** Has the worst prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

## Other Relevant Thyroid Conditions

### Non-Toxic Goitre

*   Characterized by a symmetrically enlarged thyroid, with the patient typically being euthyroid (normal thyroid function) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Follicular Adenoma

*   A benign tumor appearing as a encapsulated nodule, typically not causing diffuse symmetrical enlargement of the thyroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>. It is a small nodule, not a generalized enlargement due to inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

### Graves' Disease

*   **Clinical Presentation:** Patients present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including nervousness, muscle weakness, heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss, dyspnea, heart palpitations, and warm, moist skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Caused by Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulins (TSI) or Long-Acting Thyroid Stimulators (LATS) which bind to and stimulate TSH receptors, leading to excessive thyroid hormone production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

    *   **Scalloping of Colloid:** The colloid within the follicles appears to be "scooped out," resembling ice cream scoops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.
    *   **Pseudo Papillae:** Unlike true papillae in papillary carcinoma, these lack a fibrovascular core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.
    *   **Gross Appearance:** The thyroid gland is enlarged and appears "beefy red" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

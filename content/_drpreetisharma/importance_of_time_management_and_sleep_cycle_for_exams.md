The period leading up to an exam, particularly in the final 10 days, is considered "make or break" for students, especially those preparing for the FMGE (Foreign Medical Graduate Examination) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Effective [[time_management_techniques_for_fmge | time management]] and a disciplined sleep cycle are crucial for success during this critical phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Normalizing the Sleep Cycle
It is essential to normalize your sleep cycle because the exam is administered during the daytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Students must be alert in the morning hours to solve questions with full attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. A minimum of six hours of sleep is necessary to ensure the brain functions effectively until the exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Avoid experimenting with new medications or sleep aids one day before the exam, as their side effects are unpredictable and can negatively impact performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Maintain your established routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule
For the final nine days, the day should be divided into four time slots:
*   **Study Pattern:** This includes both theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   **Images:** Dedicate specific time for image-based revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Sanity Time:** A crucial period for mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Productive Study Hours
Students should aim for a minimum of 12 to 14 productive study hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. "Productive" means 12 hours of full concentration with the phone set aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. If daily targets can be completed in 8-9 hours, that is also acceptable; focus on the work done rather than simply logging hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

### Theory and MCQs
The final days require a strategic division of study time:
*   **Theory:** Allocate 40% of your study time to theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, focusing on LRR (Last Minute Revision) PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
*   **MCQs:** Dedicate 60% of your time to solving MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. When solving MCQs, read explanations for incorrect answers to understand if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. If a question is wrong due to a knowledge gap, quickly review 5-10 lines on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Daily Questions:** Aim to solve a minimum of 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. This number can be gradually increased by 10-15 questions each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Focus on previous year *topics* rather than memorizing answers to previous year questions, as questions are no longer copied and pasted directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

### Image-Based Revision
Allocate one hour daily for image-based revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. At the end of the day, quickly scan through all relevant images for subjects studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Image-based revision can help cover subjects quickly in 50-60 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.

### Sanity Time
Allocate 30 minutes daily for "sanity time" to prevent mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This could involve a light walk, spending time with friends, or engaging with social media in a controlled manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The goal is to step away from books to maintain mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

## [[Exam preparation strategies | Exam Preparation Strategies]]
*   **Subject Management:** Make a list of completed and remaining subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   Do not start new major topics in subjects already studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   For unstudied or weaker subjects (like orthopedics, anesthesia, forensics, dermatology, or the "giants" like anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, PSM), at least review LRR sessions or crash courses, focusing on enabling yourself to answer around 50% of questions from these topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   No subject should be completely left unstudied; aim to know a little about every subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.
    *   Prioritize short subjects (e.g., ENT, Optha, Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, Dermatology) for the first two and a half days, focusing on LRR sessions and previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs):** Giving GTs in the last 9-10 days is a personal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   If you choose to take a GT, the primary focus should be on [[time_management_techniques_for_fmge | time management]] (completing 300 questions within the allotted time) and identifying silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   Do not focus on the score, as a low score can lead to panic and hinder further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   New or "bouncer" questions (20-30 per test) are common and should not demotivate; focus on mastering known topics and avoiding errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>.
    *   Analyze GT results to understand if mistakes are due to carelessness or lack of knowledge, then address accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs):**
    *   FMG's last five years' PYQs are mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
    *   If time permits, review NEET PG's last three years' papers (conducted once a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
    *   If still more time, review the November IAI CET paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
    *   If unable to solve papers independently, listen to recall sessions on YouTube at 1.5x or 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

## [[Handling Exam Anxiety and Motivation Tactics | Managing Exam Anxiety and Stress]]
*   **Positivity:** Cultivate a positive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Social Circle:** Only interact with people who provide positive vibes, such as parents, siblings, or good friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Avoid those who brag about their scores or spread illogical rumors about exam difficulty or pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Negative Thoughts:** Do not allow negative thoughts to enter your mind, as one negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.
*   **Future Worry:** Avoid overthinking future possibilities like alarm failures or exam center issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. Focus on what needs to be done in the immediate three-hour blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
*   **Competitive Mindset:** Competitive exams are a blend of knowledge and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Maintaining mental stability and avoiding negativity are key to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **Exam Day Strategy:** Remember that one paper might be tough and another easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>. If the first paper is tough, disconnect from it during the break and do not discuss it; focus entirely on paper two to compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Sustained Concentration:** In the last nine days, practice sitting for 3 to 3.5 hours at a stretch without distractions, simulating exam conditions to build stamina and maintain alertness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. The Pomodoro technique is not suitable for this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.

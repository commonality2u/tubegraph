The Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain is a valuable diagnostic tool in pathology, often used to identify certain substances within tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. Its utility is further enhanced by assessing its sensitivity to diastase enzyme digestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

## Understanding PAS Stain and Diastase Digestion
The PAS stain gives a pink color to certain materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. When diastase enzyme is added, it breaks down specific substances, causing the pink color to disappear if that substance is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>.

*   **PAS Positive Diastase Sensitive:** If the pink color vanishes after adding diastase, the material is considered diastase sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. This indicates the presence of glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.
*   **PAS Positive Diastase Resistant:** If the pink color remains even after adding diastase, the material is diastase resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>. This means the substance is not glycogen or a glycogen-containing material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

Genetic alterations play a crucial role in the development and classification of various [[Thyroid conditions and pathology | thyroid cancers]]. Understanding these mutations is essential for diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapies.

## Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid

[[Thyroid conditions and pathology | Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid]] is primarily associated with specific genetic changes:
*   The most common genetic alteration observed is the **BRAF V600E mutation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   The second most common alteration is the **RET/PTC fusion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   [[Thyroid conditions and pathology | Papillary carcinoma]] can also be associated with radiation exposure and may follow [[Thyroid conditions and pathology | Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. It has an excellent prognosis, with a 100% survival rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## Follicular Carcinoma Thyroid

For [[Thyroid conditions and pathology | follicular carcinoma of the thyroid]], the most common genetic alteration is **RAS** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Other associated mutations include:
*   [[chromosomal_alterations_in_renal_cell_carcinoma | PTEN gene mutations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>
*   PI3K gene mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>
*   PAX/PPAR gamma mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>

## Medullary Thyroid Cancer

[[Thyroid conditions and pathology | Medullary thyroid cancer]] is characterized by the **RET gene mutation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   A mnemonic to remember this is "RET 10 MEN," indicating the RET gene on chromosome 10, associated with Medullary thyroid carcinoma and MEN (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia) syndromes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   It's important to distinguish between RET gene mutation (leading to [[Thyroid conditions and pathology | medullary carcinoma]]) and RET/PTC fusion (leading to [[Thyroid conditions and pathology | papillary carcinoma]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   A loss of function in the RET gene can lead to Hirschsprung disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   The tumor marker for [[Thyroid conditions and pathology | medullary thyroid cancer]] is calcitonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer

[[Thyroid conditions and pathology | Anaplastic thyroid cancer]] has the worst prognosis among [[Thyroid conditions and pathology | thyroid cancers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Molecular Classification of Breast Cancer

While not a [[Thyroid conditions and pathology | thyroid cancer]], the molecular classification of breast cancer provides a relevant example of genetic profiling. The basis for the [[molecular_classification_of_breast_cancer | molecular classification of breast cancer]] is **gene profiling** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. While immuno-histochemistry (IHC) is used in practice (e.g., for ER/PR/HER2 status), the underlying basis remains gene profiling due to technical and accessibility constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

**Note on HER2/neu (EGFR2) Amplification in Breast Cancer:**
*   HER2/neu, also known as EGFR2, is a different gene than EGFR1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   EGFR1 mutations are seen in adenocarcinoma of the lung, while EGFR2 (HER2/neu) amplification occurs in breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   HER2/neu amplification in breast cancer leads to increased activity, and targeted therapy like trastuzumab is used to inhibit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   HER2/neu scoring by IHC (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) guides treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. A score of 0 or 1+ indicates negative, 3+ indicates positive, and 2+ requires further investigation with FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   In FISH, the ratio of HER2/neu signals to chromosome 17 signals is calculated. A ratio greater than 2.2 indicates HER2 amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

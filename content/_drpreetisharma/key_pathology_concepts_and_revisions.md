From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

This session focuses on [[pathology_image_review_for_fmg_exam | image-based pathology review]] and theory for the FMG exam, aiming to revise key concepts and ease pre-exam tension [00:00:54]. While labeled "Top 50 images," it covers more, including both [[pathology_and_microbiology | Pathology and Microbiology]] topics [00:01:24].

> The primary purpose of this session is to impart knowledge and help ease exam-related nerves [00:01:09]. Students are advised to take deep breaths before the session to manage stress [00:02:27]. Passive learning, such as sitting in a class, is recommended if self-study is difficult [00:03:01].

*   **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>
    *   **Microscopy:** "College girl" or "garden party" appearance (presence of all myeloid maturation stages - neutrophils, myelocytes, blasts) [00:51:32].

### Lymphomas

    *   **Clinical Presentation:** African child with jaw swelling [00:51:51].
    *   **Association:** Endemic in Africa due to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) [00:51:54].
    *   **Microscopy:** "Starry sky" appearance (macrophages ingesting apoptotic tumor cells against a dark background of lymphocytes) [00:52:06].
    *   **Genetics:** Translocation involving chromosome 8 and an even number (e.g., t(8;14), t(8;22)) [00:52:14].

### Plasma Cell Dyscrasias
*   **Multiple Myeloma** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>
    *   **Clinical Presentation:** Elderly patient (60-75 years old) with lytic bone lesions [00:53:07]. (Caution: Lytic lesions alone in a child (e.g., 5-year-old) might suggest Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis) [00:53:18].
    *   **Peripheral Smear:** Rouleaux formation (RBCs stacked like coins) [00:53:47].
    *   **Plasma Cell Inclusions:**
        *   **Russell bodies:** Intracystoplasmic inclusions (Ig aggregates) [00:54:07].
        *   **Dutcher bodies:** Intranuclear inclusions (Ig aggregates) [00:54:14].
        *   **Mott cells (Morula cells):** Plasma cells filled with multiple Russell bodies, giving a mulberry-like appearance [00:54:31].
        *   **Flame cells:** Plasma cells with IgA production, appearing reddish (flame-like) [00:54:37].
    *   **Most Common Antibody:** IgG (in Russell bodies, Dutcher bodies, Mott cells) [00:54:40].
    *   **Specific to Flame Cells:** IgA is the most common antibody type [00:55:01].
    *   **Diagnosis Confirmation:** M-spike on protein electrophoresis (monoclonal spike, most commonly IgG) [00:55:29].
    *   **Genetics:** Deletion 13q and Translocation t(11;14) [00:57:03].

## Bone Marrow Biopsy Needles
*   **Salah Needle:** Has a side screw (S for Salah, S for Side screw) [00:56:34].
*   **Jamshidi Needle:** Distinguished by a bevel [00:56:45].

## Session Conclusion
*   The session covers a range of [[pathological_features_of_various_diseases | pathological features of various diseases]] and is part of a larger [[recommended_study_resources_for_pathology_residents | revision strategy for FMG exam]] [00:00:54].
*   The second half, focusing on microbiology, is scheduled for a separate session [00:57:25].
*   PDFs of the session material will be shared [01:02:16].
*   Attendees are encouraged to review previous "LRR" (Last-minute Rapid Revision) sessions for more detailed theory and [[differential_diagnosis_in_pathology | differential diagnosis in pathology]] [01:01:16].
*   A final motivational session is planned for the day before the exam (19th), focusing on tips and time management rather than new content [01:04:38].

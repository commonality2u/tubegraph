This article provides an overview of the microbiology study plan, upcoming revision schedules, and general strategies for approaching the subject.

## Study Schedule Overview

Starting from today, the focus shifts from systemic pathology to microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This dedicated microbiology phase is expected to last for a few weeks, primarily until the end of March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Following this, the schedule will alternate, returning to general pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Last-Minute Revision (LRR) Sessions

LRR sessions will be conducted on the PrepLadder YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

*   **AIIMS (AIICET)**: The earliest LRR is for AIIMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. A detailed timetable and schedule will be provided in approximately a week's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Tentatively, the AIIMS LRR is scheduled to begin on March 25th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   Specific Pathology and Microbiology LRR classes will be held in the first week of April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   These sessions will cover core topics, including:
        *   Electron microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
        *   Immunohistochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
        *   Flow cytometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
        *   Genetics of Leukemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
        *   Common questions on hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
        *   Common questions on meningitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
    *   For these specific topics, students do not need a separate list; simply following the classes will provide the necessary content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   The tentative dates for Pathology and Microbiology LRR for AIIMS are the 8th, 9th, and 10th of April, usually at 12 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>.
*   **FMG (Foreign Medical Graduate Examination) & NEET PG**: LRR for FMG and NEET PG will also commence gradually, possibly alongside AIIMS LRR, as their exams are close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>. All exams will have their respective LRR sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:40">[01:30:40]</a>.

## Study and Revision Strategies for Bacteriology

*   **PDF Availability**: PDFs of the session content will always be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Grouping Chapters**: When approaching bacteriology questions, it is highly beneficial to first group the chapters based on the information provided in the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. For example, if a question mentions Gram-positive cocci in clusters, limit your thinking to the *Staphylococcus* and *Micrococcus* chapters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Visual Memory**: Microbiology heavily relies on visual memory, so reviewing the same slides and visuals repeatedly is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Contentment and JOMO**: For subjects like microbiology and pharmacology, it's crucial to practice the "Joy of Missing Out" (JOMO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:40">[02:43:40]</a>. Instead of feeling FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) by trying to learn every rare organism, focus on what you can realistically retain from your notes and past year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.
*   **Daily Practice**: Engage with the daily 5-6 questions posted on Telegram. These questions are curated, including PYQs and potential exam questions, and typically take only about five minutes to attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.

## Specific Learning Aids

*   **Catalase Positive Organisms**: A mnemonic "SPACE BeING MaDe" helps remember catalase-positive organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
    *   **S**: Staphylococcus (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus* - golden pigment), *Serratia* (red pigment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>
    *   **P**: *Pseudomonas* (blue-green pigment, associated with green nail syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>
    *   **A & C**: Fungi like *Aspergillus*, *Candida*, and *Cryptococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>
    *   **E**: Enterobacteriaceae family and *E. coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>
    *   **B**: *Bacillus anthracis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>
    *   **NG**: *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* and *Neisseria meningitidis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>
    *   **M**: *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and *Micrococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>

## Upcoming Sessions

The next session will cover Gram-positive bacilli, for which students should read about the "McDonald" mnemonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>.

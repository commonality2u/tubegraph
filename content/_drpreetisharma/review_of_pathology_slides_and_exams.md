This session is primarily for individuals preparing for the FMG exam, serving as a vital resource for image revision and a means to alleviate pre-exam stress. The content aims to both impart knowledge and soothe nerves during a high-pressure study period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.

## Session Overview and Study Strategy

The session, initially labeled "Top 50 images," covers more than 50 images across both pathology and microbiology due to the extensive material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. For last-minute preparation, it is recommended to focus on "LRR" (Last Revision Review) sessions, which include two for pathology and two for microbiology conducted in November and December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:57">[02:01:57]</a>. This specific session is intended to be a one-time study; there is no need to revise it afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:18">[02:11:18]</a>.

Crucially, managing stress is paramount, especially as admit cards are released, increasing anxiety levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>. Passive learning, such as attending classes or listening to lectures, is highly recommended if self-study becomes difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>. During the session, students are requested to hold miscellaneous doubts until the end to maintain focus on the [[pathology_image_review | image review]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### General Advice for Exam-Going Students

*   Take deep breaths before and during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:25">[02:21:25]</a>.
*   Keeping nerves calm is more important than just mugging up previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   Avoid overthinking or creating unnecessary panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:08">[03:02:08]</a>.
*   Focus on the question at hand during the exam; the mind will automatically recall information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:41">[06:39:41]</a>.
*   Trust that knowledge is acquired, and a calm mindset is key to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

The session covered significant aspects of [[pathology_and_rapid_revision_approach | pathology and rapid revision approach]] through [[identification_of_common_pathological_findings | identification of common pathological findings]]. A follow-up session for microbiology images is planned for the next day at 11 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:32:00">[57:32:00]</a>. Students are encouraged to maintain a consistent study schedule, focusing on the provided materials and managing anxiety effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.

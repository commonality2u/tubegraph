The FMGE exam is scheduled for January 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Approximately two months plus an additional week are available for preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This period is a critical [[60day study timetable for FMGE December 2024 | 65-day challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## General Preparation Strategy

*   **Study Hours**
    *   Aim for at least 10 to 12 effective hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This means sitting for 12 hours to achieve 10 hours of output, accounting for distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Balancing MCQs and Theory**
    *   Practice MCQs alongside theory every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Do not separate them into distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
    *   Aim for 100+ MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. If this is challenging, start with 50 questions and gradually increase by 5-7 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.
    *   MCQs should be integrated with your theory study; for example, if you study four chapters of pathology, solve 20-25 MCQs per chapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>.
*   **Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision (RR)**
    *   Focus on Rapid Revision videos for primary study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
    *   Use main videos only for clarifying specific doubts or concepts that are unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. It is not practical to go through 70-80 hours of main videos per subject within the remaining time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a>.
*   **Source of Questions**
    *   Utilize any Q-bank you already have a subscription for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
    *   Focus on Previous Year Questions (PYQs), specifically previous year *topics*, rather than just memorizing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. You can use FMG Solutions or app-based resources for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
    *   It is advisable to review NEET PG and AIIMS NEET PG previous year questions for the past three years, and the current year's exam if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:06:00">[52:06:00]</a>.
*   **Revision Techniques for FMGE Exam**
    *   When making notes, highlight only the most critical 5-10 words per page to facilitate quick revision on the last day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>.
    *   Accept that forgetting is a natural human tendency; reread subjects as part of a continuous cycle until the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

### Managing Medicine

Do not allocate a block of 10 days for Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. Instead, treat Medicine as an ongoing journey:
*   Start studying Medicine for 1-1.5 hours daily from November 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>, continuing until January 19th (the day before the exam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.
*   Establish a fixed time for Medicine each day, e.g., 10 AM to 11 AM, and adhere to it with strict discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
*   This approach ensures continuous exposure and revision, especially after covering related topics in Pathology, which covers 40-50% of Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:53:00">[33:53:00]</a>.

## Round 2 Revision (December 25th - January 13th)

This round focuses on quick review and targeted efforts.
*   **December 25th - 27th (3 days):** All six short subjects (Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, Skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.
*   **December 28th - 30th (3 days):** 2.5 days for ENT and Ophthalmology, 0.5 days for a Grand Test (GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.
*   **December 31st - January 1st (2 days):** PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.
*   **January 2nd - 4th (3 days):** OBGY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.
*   **January 5th - 6th (2 days):** Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.
*   **January 7th (1 day):** Physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.
*   **January 8th - 9th (2 days):** Biochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.
*   **January 10th - 11th (2 days):** Anatomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.
*   **January 12th - 13th (2 days):** Pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

### Daily Targets for Pathology & Microbiology (Round 2)

After December 24th, focus on 17 subjects, as Pathology and Microbiology will be covered via daily, small targets (30-40 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>. These targets will be provided, focusing on high-yield topics likely to appear in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>.

## Round 3 (January 14th - January 19th)

In the final week (January 14th to 19th), focus only on previous year questions and any volatile topics that are still challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

*   **Frequency:** Aim for a minimum of five GTs before the January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** GTs are primarily for [[Time management and study techniques for FMGE | time management]] during the exam and identifying areas of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>. They train your mind to maintain alertness for the entire exam duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Do not focus on your score (e.g., 150+ marks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>. GTs on platforms are often tougher than the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>.
    *   For *correct* questions, quickly review your notes rather than reading the full explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>.
    *   For *incorrect* questions, read the explanations thoroughly from your Q-bank or solution source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid GTs in the last 15 days:** It's okay to avoid giving GTs in the last 15 days to reduce stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>.

## Lessons from Previous Exams (July 30th)

*   **Image-Based Questions (IBQs):** IBQs are important and can help you answer questions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>. While there was an exam with 130 IBQs, the number has since decreased to 65-70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>.
*   **Mixed Bag Questions:** Expect a mix of one-liner questions and clinical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>.

## [[FMGE exam preparation tips | Tips for Success]]

*   **Balancing Health:**
    *   Allocate 30-40 minutes daily for physical activity, such as a walk, which helps with both physical and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.
    *   Maintain a balanced diet and stay hydrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>.
    *   Ensure adequate sleep (around 6-7 hours) to ensure proper brain function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>.
    *   Practice deep breathing or meditation for 10-15 minutes if it helps manage stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08:00">[36:08:00]</a>.
*   **Mindset and Motivation:**
    *   Avoid negativity and pessimistic conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>. Do not listen to rumors about exam difficulty or pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:48:00">[38:48:00]</a>.
    *   Maintain a positive attitude and confidence in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>.
    *   Focus on the present day's tasks rather than worrying about the exam outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>.
    *   Recognize your past achievements (e.g., clearing MBBS) to build self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:26:00">[57:26:00]</a>.
    *   Visualize your success after January 20th, such as giving a passing interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:16:00">[59:16:00]</a>.
    *   Remember your personal motivations (parents, professional growth, financial stability, ending the study cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:58:00">[59:58:00]</a>.
    *   Starting from zero is possible, even in the last 60 days, to clear the FMGE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:59:00">[40:59:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptation:**
    *   If you have already done a revision and want to aim for a 200+ score, try to reduce the number of days for each subject in the given timetable (e.g., 4 days for anatomy to 2.5-3 days) to create extra days for an additional revision round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:40:00">[46:40:00]</a>.
    *   If you are following another ongoing timetable and it is working for you, stick to it and only pick up good points from this plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:00">[47:48:00]</a>.
    *   If you are particularly scared of certain subjects (e.g., Pharma, Anatomy, Biochemistry, Micro), you can start with them first in the initial week to get them out of the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>.
    *   It is crucial to cover all 19 subjects. If you decide to leave one subject, at least review its Last Minute Rapid Revision (LRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:38:00">[58:38:00]</a>.

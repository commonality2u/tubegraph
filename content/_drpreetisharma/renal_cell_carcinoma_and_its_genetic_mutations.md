Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is a significant topic in pathology, with various types characterized by distinct histological features and genetic alterations. Understanding these differences is crucial for diagnosis and prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Types of Renal Cell Carcinoma

### 1. Clear Cell RCC (CCC)
The most common type of RCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Characterized by empty, clear cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Photomicrographs show cells appearing white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Genetics**: Associated with the deletion of chromosome 3p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Syndrome Association**: Commonly linked to von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### 2. Papillary RCC
Often suspected clinically with right flank pain and hematuria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Tall cells arranged in papillae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Associated Bodies**: Like other papillary tumors in the body, it can show [[histology_and_its_correlation_with_specific_renal_tumors | Psammoma bodies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Genetics**:
    *   Most commonly associated with Trisomy 7 and 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
    *   Can also involve loss of the Y chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   **Fumarate Hydratase (FH) gene mutation**: This specific mutation results in [[hereditary_leiomyomatosis_and_papillary_renal_cell_carcinoma | Papillary RCC]] alongside [[hereditary_leiomyomatosis_and_papillary_renal_cell_carcinoma | hereditary leiomyomatosis]] (multiple leiomyomas/fibroids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Clinical Association**: Patients on dialysis are at a higher risk of developing Papillary RCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### 3. Chromophobe RCC
*   **Genetics**: Characterized by multiple chromosomal losses (e.g., chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 10, 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This is why it's called "chromophobe" – "phobia of chromosomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Cells resemble plant cells with proper outlines, dark reniform nuclei, and a peri-nuclear halo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Special Stain**: Stains blue with Hale's Colloidal Iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Syndrome Association**: Associated with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, which also causes fibrofolliculomas (skin adnexal tumors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### 4. Bellini Duct/Collecting Duct RCC
*   Also known as Collecting Duct RCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   Known for having the worst prognosis among RCC types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### 5. Medullary RCC
*   **Associated Condition**: Strongly associated with sickle cell trait (HbAS), not sickle cell anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

### 6. Pediatric RCC (Xp11 Translocation RCC)
*   **Genetics**: Characterized by Xp11 translocation involving the TFE3 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   Although termed "pediatric" or "childhood RCC," it can occur in adults as well, including elderly patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### 7. Renal Oncocytoma
*   A benign renal tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.
*   **Histology**: Composed of oncocytes, cells that are rich in mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
*   **Gross Appearance**: Characteristically described as mahogany brown color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
*   **Feature**: Often presents with a central stellate scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

### [[Tuberous Sclerosis and Cardiac Tumors | Tuberous Sclerosis]]
*   **Associated Renal Tumor**: [[Tuberous Sclerosis and Cardiac Tumors | Angiomyolipoma (AML)]] of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **Composition of AML**: Consists of blood vessels (angio), muscle (myo), and fat (lipo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.
*   **Associated Cardiac Tumor**: [[Tuberous Sclerosis and Cardiac Tumors | Rhabdomyoma]] of the heart, which contains spider cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Alport Syndrome
*   **Genetic Defect**: Involves a problem with collagen Type IV, specifically the alpha-5 chain (most commonly), but also alpha-3 and alpha-4 chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.
*   **Electron Microscopy**: Shows a characteristic "basketweave appearance" of the glomerular basement membrane due to holes and irregular thickening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>.
*   **Systemic Manifestations**: Besides kidney issues (nephrotic syndrome), it causes sensory neural hearing loss (ears) and anterior lenticonus (eyes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.

## Overview
*Bacillus anthracis* is a [[gram_positive_bacilli | gram positive bacilli]] and a [[sporeforming_bacteria__bacillus_and_clostridium | spore-forming bacteria]] that belongs to the *Bacillus* family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. It is classified under the "MCDONALD'S" mnemonic for [[gram_positive_bacilli | Gram Positive Bacilli]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Characteristics
*   **Spores**: *Bacillus anthracis* forms spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. These spores are typically subterminal in arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. Spores are not easily visible on normal staining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Special stains for spores include Schaefer and Fulton stain and modified Ashworth stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Motility**: Non-motile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Encapsulation**: Non-encapsulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. (Note: Transcript contradicts this later stating it has a capsule, see [[Virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis | Virulence Factors]] section).
*   **Morphology**: Appears as bamboo stick or box car appearance, with white holes in the center representing spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.
*   **Aerobic**: *Bacillus anthracis* is aerobic and requires oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

## Virulence Factors
*   **Capsule**: Unlike most bacteria with polysaccharide capsules, *Bacillus anthracis* has a polypeptide (or poly-D-glutamic acid) capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. This capsule can be visualized using Polychrome Methylene Blue, which shows purple material around the bacteria, known as the Mc Fadyean reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.
*   **Anthrax Toxin**: The anthrax toxin is tripartite, meaning it has three parts:
    *   Edema Factor (EF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>: Increases cyclic AMP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
    *   Protective Factor (PF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.
    *   Lethal Factor (LF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations ([[types_and_diagnosis_of_anthrax | Types and Diagnosis of Anthrax]])
Anthrax can manifest in three main forms, related to animal contact:
1.  **Cutaneous Anthrax (Hide Porter's Disease)**: Occurs through contact with animal skin (hide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. Typically presents as a blackish lesion called a malignant pustule (or malignant acher), which is necrolytic and hemorrhagic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>. It's often found on exposed areas like the neck, shoulder, or back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.
2.  **Pulmonary Anthrax (Wool Sorter's Disease)**: Acquired by inhaling wool fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. Causes pulmonary symptoms, often leading to hemorrhagic mediastinitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>.
3.  **Gastrointestinal Anthrax**: Results from ingesting uncooked meat from infected animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. Leads to hemorrhagic enteritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.

## Diagnostics ([[bacterial_and_fungal_diagnostics | Bacterial and Fungal Diagnostics]])
*   **Culture Media**:
    *   **Nutrient Agar**: Shows a "medusa head" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.
    *   **Blood Agar**: May show a "comet tail" appearance, "beaten egg" appearance, or "frosted glass" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>.
    *   **Penicillin Agar**: Characterized by a "string of pearls" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:59">[01:04:59]</a>.
    *   **Gelatin Stab**: On gelatin agar, when stabbed with a plain wire (not a loop), *Bacillus anthracis* shows an "inverted fir tree" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>. This is because it is aerobic and liquefies the gelatin only on the surface where oxygen is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis
*   **Scrub Typhus**: While *Bacillus anthracis* lesions (e.g., cutaneous anthrax) are on exposed areas due to direct animal contact, scrub typhus lesions are typically on hidden, moist areas of the body (e.g., axilla, groin) and involve a mite vector and shrubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.

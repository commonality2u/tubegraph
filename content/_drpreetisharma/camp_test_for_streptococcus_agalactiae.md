The CAMP test is a diagnostic technique used in microbiology, primarily for the identification of [[streptococcus_and_camp_test | *Streptococcus agalactiae*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. The name "CAMP" is an acronym derived from the first letters of the scientists who described the phenomenon: Christy, Atkins, and Munch Peterson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Clinical Relevance of *Streptococcus agalactiae*

[[streptococcus_and_camp_test | *Streptococcus agalactiae*]] is clinically significant, particularly in neonates and infants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. It can cause serious infections such as meningitis and pneumonia in this vulnerable population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. For example, a 3-week-old infant presenting with fever, irritability, poor feeding, and petechial rashes could be suspected of having meningitis caused by this bacterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Performing the CAMP Test

The CAMP test involves streaking two different bacterial cultures on an agar plate.
*   One streak consists of the suspected [[streptococcus_and_camp_test | *Streptococcus agalactiae*]] culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   The other, "main streak," is *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, which produces a CAMP factor.

### Positive Result

A positive CAMP test is indicated by the formation of an arrowhead-shaped zone of enhanced hemolysis at the intersection of the two streaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This occurs because the CAMP factor from *Staphylococcus aureus* interacts synergistically with the hemolysins produced by *Streptococcus agalactiae*.

> [!note] In a typical CAMP test setup, the primary streak is *Staphylococcus aureus*, and the test organism (*Streptococcus agalactiae*) is streaked perpendicularly to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## CAMP Test vs. Reverse CAMP Test

It is important to differentiate between the CAMP test and the reverse CAMP test:
*   **CAMP Test:** Used for the diagnosis of [[streptococcus_and_camp_test | *Streptococcus agalactiae*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. It utilizes *Staphylococcus aureus* as the main streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Reverse CAMP Test:** In contrast, the reverse CAMP test uses [[streptococcus_and_camp_test | *Streptococcus agalactiae*]] to aid in the diagnosis of *Clostridium perfringens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. In this test, *Clostridium perfringens* is the main streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

*Balantidium coli* is a parasitic protozoan that causes balantidiasis, an infection characterized by intestinal symptoms. It is often considered when a ciliated protozoa is identified in a stool examination [00:09:09].

## Key Characteristics

*   **Classification**: *Balantidium coli* is a ciliated protozoa [00:09:09].
*   **Size**: It is described as one of the largest protozoa [00:09:45].
*   **Location**: It typically infects the large intestine [00:09:52].
*   **Motility**: Being a ciliated parasite, it exhibits rotatory motility [00:10:03].
*   **Forms**: Like many other parasites, it exists in two forms: a trophozoite and a cyst [00:10:04].
*   **Infective Stage**: The cyst is the infective stage [00:10:07].
*   **Nuclei**: Both the trophozoite and the cyst forms are binucleated [00:10:27], meaning they have two nuclei [00:10:32].
    *   One nucleus is large and bean-shaped [00:10:37].
    *   The other is small and dot-like [00:10:39].

> [!INFO] Mnemonic for *Balantidium coli* characteristics:
> "Coli" can be remembered as "celi" (for ciliated) [00:09:16]. "B" for *Balantidium* can be associated with "Big" characteristics, such as being the largest [[characteristics_and_identification_of_protozoa | protozoa]], going to the big (large) intestine, and being binucleated with a big, bean-shaped nucleus [00:09:39], [00:10:41].

## Clinical Presentation

Patients infected with *Balantidium coli* often present with bloody loose motions, fever, and abdominal pain [00:07:51]. This can lead to diarrhea [00:09:57].

## Treatment

The drug of choice for treating diarrhea caused by *Balantidium coli* is Doxycycline [00:10:17].

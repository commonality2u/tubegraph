[[Balantidium coli]] is a ciliated protozoan that is often considered the most likely causative organism when a ciliated protozoa is observed in stool examination from a patient presenting with bloody loose motions, fever, abdominal pain, and a history of travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The name "coli" can be associated with "cili" due to its ciliated nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Key Characteristics

[[Balantidium coli]] exhibits several "big" characteristics:
*   **Size**
    *   It is the largest protozoa known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Location of Infection**
    *   It primarily affects the large intestine, where it causes diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Motility**
    *   As a ciliated parasite, it exhibits rotatory motility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Life Cycle Forms

Like most parasites, [[Balantidium coli]] has two main forms:
1.  **Trophozoite** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
2.  **Cyst** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>

### Nuclei Characteristics
Both the trophozoite and cyst forms of [[Balantidium coli]] are binucleated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Big Nucleus**: This nucleus is characteristically bean-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Small Nucleus**: This nucleus appears like a dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Infective Stage
The infective stage of [[Balantidium coli]] for humans is the cyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Treatment
The drug of choice for diarrhea caused by [[Balantidium coli]] is Doxycycline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

*Balantidium coli* is a ciliated protozoan that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Patients with *Balantidium coli* infection may present with bloody loose motions, fever, and abdominal pain over several days, often following a history of travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Identification
Stool examination may reveal a ciliated protozoan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The name "coli" can serve as a mnemonic for "celi," referring to its ciliated nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Key Characteristics
*Balantidium coli* can be remembered with the mnemonic "B for Balantidium, B for Big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, as it is associated with "big" features:
*   **Size** It is considered one of the largest protozoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Location** It primarily affects the large intestine, where it can cause diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Forms** Like many other parasites, *Balantidium coli* exists in two forms: a trophozoite and a cyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The cyst is the infective stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Nuclei** Both the trophozoite and cyst forms are binucleated, meaning they contain two nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. One nucleus is large and bean-shaped, while the other is small and dot-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Motility** Being a ciliated parasite, *Balantidium coli* exhibits rotatory motility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Treatment
The drug of choice for *Balantidium coli* infection is doxycycline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

In a microbiology lab, string tests are done for *Vibrio cholerae* and *Klebsiella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

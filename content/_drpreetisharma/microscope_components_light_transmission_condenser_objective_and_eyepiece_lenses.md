This article provides an overview of various [[Microscopy techniques Light fluorescent and electron microscopes|microscopy techniques]] and their components, focusing on the identification and function of each part as discussed in a [[Microbiology study techniques for exams|microbiology]] and [[Review of pathology slides and exams|pathology]] context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Light Microscope

The light microscope is a fundamental tool for viewing specimens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.

### Components of a Light Microscope

*   **Light Source**: The light used in a light microscope is transmitted light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07">[02:22:07]</a>.
*   **Condenser**: This component is located below the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:01">[02:55:01]</a>.
*   **Stage**: The flat platform where the specimen is placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Objective Lens**: These lenses are close to the object being viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Common magnifications for objective lenses include 4x, 10x, 40x, and 100x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:05">[03:26:05]</a>.
*   **Eyepiece Lens (Ocular Lens)**: This is the lens closest to the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Its typical magnification is 10x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

### Total Magnification

To calculate the total magnification, multiply the eyepiece lens magnification by the objective lens magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. The maximum magnification for a standard light microscope is typically 1000x (10x eyepiece * 100x objective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## Fluorescent Microscope

A [[Microscopy techniques Light fluorescent and electron microscopes|fluorescent microscope]] looks similar to a light microscope but includes additional features like dichroic mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

*   **Light Source**: [[Microscopy techniques Light fluorescent and electron microscopes|Fluorescent microscopes]] use ultraviolet (UV) light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   **Wavelength Conversion**: The dichroic mirror converts short wavelengths of light to longer wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Stains**: Specific [[Diagnostic staining techniques Fluorescent stains for bacteria and fungi|fluorescent stains]] are used with this microscope:
    *   Auramine-Rhodamine: For *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (TB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
    *   Acridine Orange: For malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
    *   Calcofluor White: For fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
    *   Rhodanine: Used for copper (e.g., in Wilson's Disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

## Electron Microscope

The [[Microscopy techniques Light fluorescent and electron microscopes|electron microscope]] appears enclosed, resembling a "space rocket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

*   **Vacuum**: It is fully enclosed to maintain a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Illumination**: Unlike light microscopes, electron microscopes do not use light; they use electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Viruses, which cannot be seen with normal light microscopes, are typically viewed using an [[Microscopy techniques Light fluorescent and electron microscopes|electron microscope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:0:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

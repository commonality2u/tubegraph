This article explores various common renal pathologies, focusing on their diagnostic features, particularly those observed in photomicrographs and other imaging techniques. Understanding these visual cues is crucial for accurate diagnosis in [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | pathology]].

## Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)

Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is a significant renal malignancy often suspected clinically and radiologically. A common presentation includes right flank pain and hematuria, with a palpable flank mass and tumor mass revealed by CCT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Types of Renal Cell Carcinoma

Several types of RCC exist, each with distinct histological and genetic features:

*   **Clear Cell RCC (CCC)**
    *   **Most Common**: It is the most frequently encountered type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   **Histology**: Characterized by empty, clear cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, appearing white or clear in photomicrographs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   **Genetics**: Associated with deletion of chromosome 3p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> and [[histology_and_its_correlation_with_specific_renal_tumors | VHL syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

*   **Papillary RCC**
    *   **Histology**: Features tall cells arranged in papillae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Any papillary tumor in the body often shows psammoma bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   **Genetics**: Commonly associated with trisomy 7 and 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, and loss of the Y chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   **Associations**: Patients undergoing dialysis are at risk for papillary RCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Mutations in the Fumarate Hydratase (FH) gene are also linked to papillary RCC, specifically with hereditary leiomyomatosis (leiomyomas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

*   **Chromophobe RCC**
    *   **Genetics**: Characterized by multiple chromosomal losses, such as chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 10, and 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   **Associations**: Linked to Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome, which may present with fibrofolliculomas (skin adnexal tumor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Histology**: Resembles "plant cells" with proper outlines, dark nuclei (raisinoid nuclei), and a perinuclear halo (white area around the nucleus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. It stains blue with Kholod Iron stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

*   **Bellini Duct (Collecting Duct) RCC**: Known for having the worst prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

*   **Medullary RCC**: Strongly associated with sickle cell trait, not sickle cell anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. This is a common point of confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

*   **Xp11 Translocation RCC**: Often seen in children (childhood RCC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, but can occur in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It involves the TFE3 gene on the X chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Other Renal Tumors

*   **Angiomyolipoma (AML)**
    *   **Composition**: A benign tumor composed of blood vessels (angio), muscle (myo), and fat (lipoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
    *   **Association**: Strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis (TSC1/TSC2 genes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Tuberous sclerosis also causes cardiac rhabdomyomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>, which contain spider cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

*   **Renal Oncocytoma**
    *   **Nature**: A benign renal tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
    *   **Histology**: Cells are rich in mitochondria ("oncosite" meaning rich in mitochondria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Grossly, it has a mahogany brown color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
    *   **Distinctive Feature**: Often shows a central stellate scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

## Urinary Bladder Pathology

*   **Schistosomiasis (Cystocele)**
    *   **Association**: Most commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>, but can also cause transitional cell carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

## Glomerular Nephritis (GN)

[[renal_pathology_and_crystal_identification | Renal pathology]] often involves glomerular diseases, identified through specific patterns in microscopy.

### Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)

*   **Clinical Features**: Presents as a nephritic syndrome, characterized by hematuria, oliguria (urine output < 400ml/24 hours), hypertension, and azotemia (increased blood urea nitrogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.

### Immunofluorescence and Electron Microscopy Patterns

[[importance_of_image_interpretation_in_pathology | Image interpretation]] is key to diagnosing various glomerular diseases, especially with techniques like immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM).

HER2, also known as EGFR2 or ErbB2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, is a significant marker in [[Breast Cancer and Genetic Alterations|breast cancer]].

## Mechanism: Gene Amplification
When HER2 is positive, it indicates that gene amplification has occurred, meaning the gene starts working more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Diagnosis and Testing
### Immunohistochemical (IHC) Staining
Immunohistochemical staining for HER2 typically produces a brown color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This brown coloration is due to a stain called DAB (diaminobenzidine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
To test for HER2 gene amplification, the investigation of choice is FISH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Normal Results:** In a normal female, two red color signals are typically seen, representing two chromosome 17s and two HER2 genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Amplified Results:** Multiple red color signals indicate that HER2 is definitely amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### IHC Scoring and Follow-up
The scoring from IHC staining guides further action:
*   **0 or 1+:** Indicates no HER2 amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **3+:** Indicates certain HER2 amplification, allowing for treatment with trastuzumab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **2+:** This is an equivocal situation. If the pathologist writes 2+ on IHC, a FISH analysis should be carried out to confirm amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

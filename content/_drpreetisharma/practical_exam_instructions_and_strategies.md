## Pre-Exam Day Checklist and Advice
To minimize stress and ensure a smooth exam experience, it is crucial to complete specific tasks the day before the exam:
*   **Wrap up revision early**: Finish active studying by 7:00 or 7:30 PM the evening before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Prioritize sleep**: Aim for a good night's sleep, as it is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This contributes to [[balancing_exam_preparation_with_personal_health | personal health]].
*   **Verify documents**:
    *   Ensure your admit card is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Confirm your valid ID proof's name matches the admit card without any spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   Remember not to paste the photograph on the admit card, as per email instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   Keep your ID in an easily accessible place to avoid misplacing it in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Locate exam center**: Check and confirm the exact location of your exam center in advance, not on the morning of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Last-Minute Revision
For those looking to do some final revision up to 7:30-8:00 PM:
*   **Refer to your volatile list**: If you have a personal list of volatile topics, review that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Scan images**: If you don't have a specific list or are unsure what to study, scan through images from subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Orthopedics, and Radiology, as they often have classical spotter images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This is part of [[medical_exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation strategies]].

## Exam Day Logistics
*   **Arrive early**: Entry for Paper 1 starts at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM. Do not arrive at the last minute; ensure you reach in time to allow your heart rate to normalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Paper 2 entry**: You will remain at the center for Paper 2, so ensure you are present for its entry timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Strategies During the Exam

### Managing Exam Anxiety and Stress
Many students experience increased heart rate and palpitations before the exam, which is a normal reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Here are [[strategies_to_manage_exam_anxiety | strategies to manage exam anxiety]] and [[handling_examrelated_anxiety_and_stress | handling exam-related anxiety and stress]]:
*   **Maintain a positive mindset**: Believe that your exam will be easy and focus on avoiding silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Count your blessings**: Reflect on all the positive things that have happened and will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Believe that nothing bad can happen to you and that everyone is supporting you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This is a key [[techniques_for_maintaining_positivity_and_focus_during_exam_preparation | technique for maintaining positivity and focus]].
*   **Avoid self-doubt**: Do not doubt your preparation or memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Trust in yourself, your hard work, and your teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Embrace faith**: Stick to whatever you believe in—God, universe, energy, parents' blessings, or a superstition—as it provides security and keeps negativity away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### Approach to Questions
*   **Switch on/switch off mode**: For each question, "switch on" to attempt it, then "switch off" and move to the next. Do not dwell on past questions or worry about future ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Do not overthink**: Overthinking leads to problems in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Spend about 45 seconds on a question, mark the answer, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Trust your gut feeling**: Your first gut feeling is usually right. Do not change answers later due to panic or overthinking, especially in the last 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Read carefully**: Even if a question seems familiar, read the entire question and all options thoroughly. A twist in the question or options can lead to silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Rule out options**: If you don't know the direct answer, try to rule out incorrect options to arrive at the correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. These are valuable [[mcq_examination_tips | MCQ examination tips]].

### Managing Difficult Questions ("Bouncers")
The exam often features a mix of easy and difficult questions; typically, one paper is easier and the other is harder to maintain balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Expect tough questions**: Anticipate 10-20 "bouncers" or very difficult questions that even experts might find challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These questions are not meant for everyone to solve and serve to maintain the exam's screening level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Don't let them demotivate you**: These questions can cause your motivation to drop, especially if they appear consecutively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Do not give up hope even if paper one feels too difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Don't focus on bouncers**: The biggest mistake is focusing on these 20 tough questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Instead, focus on the other questions where you can avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Guess and move on**: For bouncers, smile, mark A/B/C/D randomly, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. They are tough for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Pacing and Time Management
*   **Balanced paper**: The exam will be balanced, with some quick one-liner questions and some lengthy ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Don't worry if a long question takes more than 50 seconds; one-liners will balance it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **Initial lag is normal**: It's common for the first 15 minutes to be slower as you settle in. A lag of 2-4 questions in the beginning is okay, as your pace will pick up and cover it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Inter-Paper Break Instructions
*   **Avoid discussions**: Do not sit and chat or discuss questions with other students between Paper 1 and Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **No recall sessions**: Avoid messaging or looking at recall sessions between papers. Knowing you made a mistake in Paper 1 can negatively impact your performance in Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Light refreshments**: Eat or drink something light and energizing for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Final Encouragement and Mindset
*   **You are already doctors**: Understand that the exam is a formality. You are already doctors in practice; this exam is merely a legal process to put the "doctor" title before your name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.
*   **Confidence vs. practicality**: Be super confident until you sit at the computer screen (around 8:30 AM). Once seated, switch to a sane and practical mindset, reading every question and option carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **Beyond the exam**: There is more to life than exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Your true worth is not defined by one piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Ignore judgment**: Do not worry about what others will say if you don't clear the exam. Your true supporters (teachers, parents) know your hard work and will stand by you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Ignore those who judge you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

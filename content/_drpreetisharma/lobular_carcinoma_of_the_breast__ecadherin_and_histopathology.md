Lobular carcinoma of the breast is a type of [[breast_cancer_classification_and_diagnosis | breast cancer]] that presents with distinct histopathological features and a specific molecular basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A 58-year-old woman might present with irregular nodularity in her breast, which she first palpated herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Mammography may reveal irregular densities in both breasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. A needle biopsy is performed for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This cancer can be bilateral and multicentric, although it is not always the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Histopathology: Indian File Pattern
One of the classical histological findings in lobular carcinoma is the "Indian file pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. In this pattern, tumor cells are arranged one behind the other, forming a single, disciplined line, similar to "Indian army men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. This pattern can be seen in proper lobular carcinoma or even in its premalignant form, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Molecular Basis: E-cadherin
The characteristic arrangement of cells in lobular carcinoma is due to a down-regulation of the E-cadherin protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The gene responsible for E-cadherin is `CDH1`, and a defect in this gene leads to lobular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

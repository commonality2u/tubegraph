This session is designed for [[imagebased_medical_pathology_questions | image-based medical pathology questions]] and [[pathology_and_microbiology_mcqs | microbiology MCQs]], particularly targeting the FMG exam. Its purpose is to help students revise images and alleviate exam-related anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While labeled "Top 50," it covers more than 50 images across both pathology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Students are advised to review past Last Revision Review (LRR) sessions for comprehensive theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The content covered in this specific session does not require further revision afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

The most crucial advice for exam preparation is to manage nerves through deep breathing, as this is more vital than rote memorization of previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. If self-study is challenging, passive learning (e.g., listening to sessions) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Attendees are asked to avoid miscellaneous doubts during the session and hold them until the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

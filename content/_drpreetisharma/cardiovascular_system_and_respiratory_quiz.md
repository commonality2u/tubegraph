From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

This article summarizes key pathology topics related to the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, presented in a quiz format during a "Weekly Wednesday Wisdom" session. The session aims to provide an orientation for medical students preparing for exams like INI CET, FMGE, and NEET PG, emphasizing the importance of integrated learning and visual memory.

## Session Overview and Format

The "Weekly Wednesday Wisdom" sessions are held every Wednesday at 11 AM on this channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The session structure is designed to maximize learning:
*   **Pre-session**: Students are advised to read the assigned chapter from either main videos or rapid revision resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Live Session**: Attend the live quiz and discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Post-session**: Review the discussed topic, especially images, for about 30 minutes. Images for rapid revision are typically found at the end of the rapid revision sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Study Schedule and Strategy

The timetable is provided until March, with plans for April and May to be released later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The schedule is structured to help students finish their syllabus before upcoming exams like the May INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. The initial focus is on systems to aid in medicine revision, followed by bacteriology, parasitology, and virology. General pathology and hematology will be covered in April and May, particularly important for INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

For students appearing for May/June/July exams, prioritizing rapid revision and attending live sessions, along with attempting Q-Bank, is recommended over watching full main videos due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## Quiz Questions and Detailed Explanations

### Cardiac Tumors and Related Syndromes

A patient with intellectual disability and seizures presenting with a cardiac tumor most likely has a Rhabdomyoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This is classically associated with Tuberous Sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

*   **Tuberous Sclerosis** is linked to TSC1 (chromosome 9, hamartin protein) and TSC2 (chromosome 16, tuberin protein) genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Mnemonic "ASH LEAF"** for common findings:
        *   **A**sh-leaf spots (hypopigmented lesions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>
        *   **S**hagreen patch (leathery, thick skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>
        *   **H**eart: Rhabdomyoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>
        *   **L**ungs: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>
        *   **E**pilepsy/Cortical tubers: Leading to intellectual disability and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) is a CNS tumor also associated with tuberous sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
        *   **K**idney: Angiomyolipoma (AML) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>
        *   **F**ace: Angiofibroma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>
    *   Most of these tumors (rhabdomyoma, LAM, AML) are **hamartomatous** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Hamartomas are disorganized overgrowths of mature cells native to the tissue, explaining why skeletal muscle tumors (rhabdomyoma) can occur in the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

#### Common Cardiac Tumors:
*   **Most common overall**: Secondary (metastatic) tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   **Primary benign cardiac tumors**:
    *   **Adults**: Myxoma (most common, often in left atrium, jelly-like appearance, characterized by lepidic cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Children**: Rhabdomyoma (most common, often in left ventricle, associated with tuberous sclerosis, characterized by "spider cells" which are PAS-positive due to glycogen content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
*   **Primary malignant cardiac tumors**:
    *   **Adults**: Angiosarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Children**: Rhabdomyosarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   **Cardiac valvular tumor**: Papillary Fibroelastoma (often described as a "sea anemone-like" mass) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

### Cardiomyopathies: Genetic Alterations and Features

#### Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)
A patient with increased atrial size and a diagnosis of DCM likely has a genetic alteration in **Titan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. Titan is the largest protein in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. DCM is characterized by dilation of all four cardiac chambers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. A common cause is alcohol, and a characteristic histological finding is a "ninja star appearance" of the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.

#### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
HCM is associated with mutations in the **myosin heavy chain** gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>. Histologically, HCM presents with a "banana-shaped heart" and a characteristic "disarray" or "helter-skelter" arrangement of cardiac muscle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>. It's crucial to differentiate from other causes of hypertrophy; absence of myofiber disarray rules out HCM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>.

#### Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
ARVC is linked to mutations in **plakoglobin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. It is characterized by progressive fatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. ARVC can be part of [[Naxos Syndrome]] which includes woolly hair and keratoderma (thick palms and soles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>.

#### Muscular Dystrophies
**Dystrophin** gene mutations are associated with muscular dystrophies like Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

### Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)

A patient presenting with respiratory issues but found to have a mid-systolic click and negative ASO titer/anti-streptolysin O suggests [[medical_advice_and_classifications | Mitral Valve Prolapse]] (MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a>. MVP is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>. Other names for MVP include floppy valve syndrome or Barlow syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>. Pathologically, it is characterized by myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve, where the valve tissue becomes jelly-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:00">[28:02:00]</a>. It's important to rule out rheumatic heart disease (RHD) by checking for evidence of streptococcal infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>.

### [[Myocardial Infarction and Complications | Myocardial Infarction]] (MI) and Complications

For an anterior wall MI, the most likely complication to occur within **3 to 7 days** post-MI is **rupture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>. This is because the body is still in a necrotic phase (coagulative necrosis) and hasn't yet formed granulation tissue, which begins around the seventh day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.

*   **Dressler's Syndrome** (autoimmune pericarditis) is a late complication, typically appearing 19-21 days (around 3 weeks) post-MI, as antibody formation takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>.

### TTC Staining for Myocardial Infarction

Normal, viable heart tissue stains **brick red** with Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC), also known as TPTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>. This stain reacts with LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase), specifically LDH1, which is abundant in normal heart tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>. Infarcted (dead) tissue, lacking LDH, will appear pale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>. TTC staining is useful for macroscopically identifying MI within the first four hours, before visible changes occur in the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>.

### Reperfusion Injury

Reperfusion injury occurs when blood flow is restored to ischemic tissue (e.g., after unclogging a coronary artery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>. It is mediated by:
*   **Free radicals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:00]</a>
*   **Inflammatory cells** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:14:00">[37:14:00]</a>
*   **Calcium overload**: Leading to excessive muscle contraction and "contraction band necrosis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.
Reperfusion injury does **not** involve granulation tissue formation, as this is a healing process that occurs later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:02:00">[39:02:00]</a>.

### Lung Carcinomas

A lung tumor positive for chromogranin is characteristic of **Small Cell Carcinoma** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:55:00">[40:55:00]</a>.

#### Small Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
*   Shows neuroendocrine differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:18:00">[41:18:00]</a>.
*   **IHC markers**: Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, Bombesin, CD56, CD57, NSE (Neuron-Specific Enolase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:04:00">[42:04:00]</a>. These markers are also found in other neuroendocrine tumors like pheochromocytoma and carcinoid tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:46:00">[42:46:00]</a>.
*   Often associated with numerous paraneoplastic syndromes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:56:00">[42:56:00]</a> ("chota packet, bada dhamaka").
*   Has an aggressive course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:14:00">[43:14:00]</a>.
*   **Negative for Mucin** (Mucin is a marker for adenocarcinoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:19:00">[43:19:00]</a>.
*   **Histological features**:
    *   Electron microscopy shows neurosecretory granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>.
    *   "Salt and pepper" chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:21:00">[44:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Azzopardi effect**: Blue blood vessels due to smudged DNA from broken cancer cells, staining blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:00">[44:37:00]</a>. This DNA can be confirmed with a Fuelgen stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:39:00">[45:39:00]</a>.

#### Other relevant markers:
*   Non-specific Esterase (NSE) is positive in monoblasts (AML) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:58:00">[47:58:00]</a>.
*   CD16 and CD56 are markers for Natural Killer (NK) cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:37:00">[48:37:00]</a>.

### Granulomatous Diseases: TB vs. Sarcoidosis

A 24-year-old patient with chest discomfort, night sweats, fever, cough, cervical lymphadenopathy, and a biopsy showing Langhans giant cells with a lymphocytic collar is indicative of **Tuberculosis (TB)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:04:00">[49:04:00]</a>.

*   **TB granulomas** are characterized by a lymphocytic collar (blue cells surrounding the granuloma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:32:00">[51:32:00]</a>. They commonly show caseous necrosis, though non-caseating granulomas can also occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:58:00">[55:55:00]</a>.
*   **Sarcoidosis** is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically requires additional findings beyond just a granuloma, such as elevated calcium levels, elevated ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) levels, and an increased CD4/CD8 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:31:00">[50:31:00]</a>. Sarcoid granulomas are described as "naked granulomas" because they lack the surrounding lymphocytic collar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:00">[51:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Sarcoidosis bodies**:
        *   **Asteroid bodies**: Star-shaped inclusions found within giant cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:26:00">[52:26:00]</a>. These are *intracellular* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:57:00">[54:57:00]</a>.
        *   **Schaumann bodies**: Concentric lamellated calcifications (similar to psammoma bodies but seen in sarcoidosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:02:00">[53:52:00]</a>.

#### Occupational Lung Diseases and TB Susceptibility
**Silicosis**, common in glass and silica industries, significantly increases the risk of TB and lung cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:48:00">[53:48:00]</a>. Silicosis can also show eggshell calcifications on radiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.

#### Asbestosis Bodies
**Asbestos bodies** (or "ferruginous bodies") are dumbbell-shaped structures that are initially brown and later appear blue with Pearls/Prussian blue stain due to iron deposition around inhaled asbestos fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:12:00">[57:12:00]</a>.
*   **Key principle**: All asbestos bodies are ferruginous bodies (because asbestos fibers *will* have iron deposited around them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:08:00">[59:08:00]</a>. However, not all ferruginous bodies are asbestos bodies (because iron can deposit around other inhaled particles like silica or coal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:17:00">[59:17:00]</a>.

### Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency

A four-year-old boy with an unknown cause of death and a lung finding of panacinar emphysema suggests [[Balancing MCQs and Theory in FMGE Preparation | Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

*   This is an **autosomal recessive disorder** with onset in childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   The gene is located on **chromosome 14** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.
*   **Panacinar emphysema** means destruction of the entire acinus (respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct, and alveolar sac) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Liver manifestations**: Children can develop cirrhosis. Histologically, there are PAS-positive, diastase-resistant pink droplets in the liver, representing accumulated misfolded alpha-1 antitrypsin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

## Conclusion and Homework

The session emphasized the importance of continuous revision and targeting specific topics. For the next session, students are tasked with studying all PAS-positive substances and determining if they are diastase-sensitive or diastase-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The upcoming topics for the next "Weekly Wednesday Wisdom" on January 31st are GIT and Liver pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>.

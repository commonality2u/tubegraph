Gram-negative bacilli are a significant topic in bacteriology, often considered challenging by students [00:00:30]. This article outlines key characteristics, associated diseases, diagnostic tests, and important distinctions among various [[gram_positive_bacilli | Gram negative bacilli]].

## Enterobacteriaceae Family
The Enterobacteriaceae family is a group of [[gram_positive_bacilli | Gram negative bacilli]] that are rod-shaped [00:05:14]. They are commonly delineated based on their ability to ferment lactose [00:05:38]. The prototype organism for this family is *E. coli* [00:06:00].
Common lactose-fermenting organisms include *E. coli* and *Klebsiella* [00:07:54].

### *E. coli* Toxin Mechanisms
*E. coli* can produce several toxins with distinct mechanisms of action:
*   **Heat-Labile Toxin (LT)**: Increases cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, similar to cholera toxin [00:06:15]. This is recalled by the mnemonic "labile in the air" (AMP) [00:06:28].
*   **Heat-Stable Toxin (ST)**: Increases cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels [00:06:40]. This is recalled by the mnemonic "stable on the ground" (GMP) [00:06:34].
*   **Verocytotoxin (also known as Shiga-like toxin or SLT)**: Decreases protein synthesis by inhibiting the 60S ribosome [00:07:09].

### Specific *E. coli* Groups and Associated Conditions
*   **Enteropathogenic *E. coli* (EPEC)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
    *   Causes pediatric or infantile diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
    *   Its virulence marker is bundle-forming pili, which are plasmid-coded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   Causes attachment and effacement (A/E) lesions on intestinal villi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The mnemonic "attached to children" helps remember this association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Enterotoxigenic *E. coli* (ETEC)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>
    *   Causes traveler's diarrhea, often indicated by a history of travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   Its virulence marker is colonization factor antigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This can be remembered by associating "travel" with "colonization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
    *   It produces heat-labile and heat-stable toxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
*   **Enteroinvasive *E. coli* (EIEC)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>
    *   Causes dysentery, characterized by diarrhea with blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
    *   Its virulence marker is virulence marker antigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
    *   It is identified by the Sereny test, where inoculation into an animal's eye causes purulent keratoconjunctivitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The Sereny test is also known as the Anton test for [[listeria | Listeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Enterohemorrhagic *E. coli* (EHEC)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>
    *   Causes hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized by a triad of hemolytic anemia, renal involvement, and thrombocytopenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
    *   The specific strain most commonly associated is O157:H7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
    *   Unlike other *E. coli* strains, EHEC O157:H7 is sorbitol-negative on SMAC (Sorbitol MacConkey Agar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, meaning it does not ferment sorbitol and will not produce a pink color on the agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Enteroaggregative *E. coli* (EAEC)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>
    *   Causes persistent diarrhea, defined as diarrhea lasting more than 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
    *   Its virulence marker is the enteroaggregative toxin (EAST1 toxin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.
    *   Displays a "stacked brick" appearance on HEp-2 cell lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

### *Klebsiella*
*Klebsiella* is a [[gram_positive_bacilli | Gram negative bacilli]] that ferments lactose [00:22:40]. It is distinguished by forming mucoid colonies, which are associated with its capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. This mucoid appearance can be tested with a string test, where the colony strings when lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

## Culture Media for Lactose Fermenters
Three primary culture media are used to identify lactose fermentation:
*   **MacConkey Agar** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>
    *   Composition: Peptone, agar, lactose, neutral red (indicator), and bile salts (selective agent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
    *   Category: Differential, indicator, and selective medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
    *   Result: Lactose fermenting organisms produce pink colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **CLED (Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient) Agar** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>
    *   Indicator: Bromothymol blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
    *   Result: Lactose fermenting colonies turn yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
    *   Advantage: CLED is considered better than MacConkey because it is less inhibitory, allowing both [[gram_positive_and_gram_negative_cocci | Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms]] to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
*   **EMB (Eosin Methylene Blue) Agar** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>
    *   Result: Lactose fermenting colonies exhibit a greenish metallic sheen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

## Vibrio
Vibrios are classified based on their salt tolerance:
*   **Non-halophilic (non-salt loving)**: *Vibrio cholerae* and *Vibrio mimicus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.
*   **Halophilic (salt loving)**: *Vibrio parahaemolyticus*, *Vibrio vulnificus*, and *Vibrio alginolyticus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

### Specific Vibrio Species
*   ***Vibrio alginolyticus***: This species is the most salt-tolerant (more than 10% NaCl) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. It is associated with conjunctivitis and otitis media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.
*   ***Vibrio parahaemolyticus***: Causes gastroenteritis, often linked to seafood consumption (raw fish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. It exhibits the Kanagawa phenomenon on Wagatsuma Agar, where pathogenic strains show beta-hemolysis on high-salt blood agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
*   ***Vibrio vulnificus***: Can cause severe wound infections and sepsis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or those with cirrhotic liver disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

### Cholera Toxin
[[Bacterial anatomy and physiology | Cholera toxin]] (CTX) is a key virulence factor of *Vibrio cholerae* [00:46:48].
*   **Binding**: The B fragment of cholera toxin binds to GM1 ganglioside on host cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.
*   **Cellular Effect**: It affects the Zona Occludens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.
*   **Mechanism of Action**: The A fragment activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.
    *   Other toxins that increase cyclic AMP include Anthrax toxin (from [[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]]), *E. coli* labile toxin (ETEC), and *Bordetella pertussis* toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.

### String Test
The string test involves touching a mucoid colony and observing a "string" when the loop is pulled away [00:30:23].
*   It is positive for *Klebsiella* (due to its capsule) [00:31:16].
*   It is also positive for *Vibrio cholerae* (from rice-water stools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
*   Another string test, performed on patients, is for *Giardia lamblia* in parasitology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

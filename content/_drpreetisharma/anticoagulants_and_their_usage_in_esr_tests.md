Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) testing requires specific anticoagulants depending on the method used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## ESR Testing Methods and Associated Anticoagulants
ESR can be measured using three primary methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>:

### Manual Methods
Two manual methods are commonly employed, performed by a doctor or technician without machine assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>:

*   **Winrobe Tube Method**
    *   Blood is collected in an EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid) vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   This corresponds to a purple-colored vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

*   **Westergren Pipette Method**
    *   Blood is collected in a light blue vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   The anticoagulant used is tricodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Automated Machines
For automated ESR measurement, laboratories use specialized machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>:

*   Blood is collected in a black-colored vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   This vacutainer also contains tricodium citrate as the anticoagulant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Anticoagulant Overview for ESR
While EDTA can be used, tricodium citrate is a widely applicable anticoagulant for ESR tests, particularly with the Westergren pipette and automated methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The choice between light blue and black vacutainers for tricodium citrate depends on the specific technique (Westergren pipette versus direct machine use) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Other Anticoagulants and Their Uses
Beyond ESR, other anticoagulants are used for various diagnostic tests:

*   **Sodium Fluoride & Potassium Oxalate**
    *   Used in gray vacutainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
    *   Primarily for glucose estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   Potassium oxalate acts as the anticoagulant, while sodium fluoride is an additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

*   **Heparin**
    *   Found in green-colored vacutainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   Primarily used for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, particularly in anesthesiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

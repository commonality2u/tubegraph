This article outlines a detailed [[Time Table for FMGE Preparation | preparation strategy]] for the [[FMGE December 2023 preparation strategy | FMGE December 2023 exam]], taking into account challenges faced by candidates after the July exam results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The strategy emphasizes a structured approach over approximately three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Current Situation and Mindset
Many candidates may be feeling anxious or demotivated after the July exam results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, it's important to remember that not clearing the July exam provides an opportunity to prepare for the December 2023 exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. It's crucial to focus on the positive and maintain a motivated mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

> [!INFO] Embrace Positivity
> No matter how late things happen in life, always find that tiny little element of good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This is the ray of hope that keeps you going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Don't dwell on past failures; instead, focus on the current opportunity for the December 2023 exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Overall Study Plan
The overall plan aims to complete the syllabus and allow for at least two to three revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Time Allocation
Candidates have approximately three months until the December 2023 exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The initial phase of syllabus completion is planned for 46 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Daily Study Hours
A commitment of 12 to 14 hours of study per day is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This intensive period is necessary to clear the December attempt and avoid the June 2024 session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Strategic Study Breaks
> You don't need to stay up all night or completely abandon social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The goal is to optimize your 12-14 hours of study effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Study Material and Approach

### Rapid Revision vs. Main Videos
For efficient syllabus completion within 45-50 days, focusing on rapid revision videos is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. It's humanly and practically not possible to go through all main videos for 19 subjects in three months while also doing revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Smart Learning Approach
> Use rapid revision as your primary source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. If you encounter a concept you don't understand (e.g., cardiomyopathy), quickly refer to the main video for that specific topic and then return to rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Subject-Specific Recommendations

*   **OBG (Obstetrics and Gynaecology) & PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine)**: For these subjects, it is advisable to prioritize main videos due to their high weightage (40+ questions each) in the [[FMGE December 2023 preparation strategy | FMGE exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Rapid revision alone might not be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects (Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Microbiology)**: These subjects are easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The strategy is to read less but revise it repeatedly and with high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Rapid revision notes should be memorized with extreme precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   The rapid revision of Pathology and Microbiology is 100% sufficient for the [[FMGE December 2023 preparation strategy | FMGE]] and NEET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
*   **Medicine**: Due to its vastness, tackling medicine as a single, large subject can be daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Instead, dedicate one hour to medicine every day as a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. This consistent, integrated approach helps in gradual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

## Question Practice
Solving MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions) side-by-side with theory is absolutely essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. You cannot afford to study theory first and then approach questions later, especially with only three months remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Sources of Questions
*   **Textbook-wise questions**: [[FMGE December 2023 preparation strategy | FMGE Solutions]] is a good source for previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **App-based questions**: Prepladder's question bank is recommended, especially for clinical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Clinical Question Bank**: Modern [[FMGE December 2023 preparation strategy | FMGE exams]] feature increasingly clinical and lengthy questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. A clinical question bank is crucial to practice these, as previous year questions are often fact-based and one-liners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**: PYQs are important to identify frequently asked topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
    *   Do the last five years of [[FMGE December 2023 preparation strategy | FMGE]] PYQs (10 sessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.
    *   Do at least three years of NEET PG PYQs; ideally, extend to five years if time permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
    *   For INI-CET, focus on the current exam's recall videos (March and November 2023 sessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.

### Number of Questions per Day
Aim to solve between 100 to 150 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. Start with 50 questions and gradually increase by 5-7 questions daily to reach 100-150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. This gradual, step-wise approach helps build speed and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)
Take a Grand Test at the beginning of your [[60day study timetable for FMGE December 2024 | preparation]] to establish a baseline score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE] GT Score Improvement
> Don't aim for a massive jump overnight. Set small targets, aiming to improve your score by at least 10 marks in every subsequent GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Avoid unnecessary self-pressure from the first GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
>
> Analyze your GT results to identify weaker subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. If you score low due to a particular subject (e.g., OBG), dedicate 4-5 days to revise it thoroughly before taking another GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.

## [[Revision plan and strategies for FMGE | Revision Strategy]]
Revision should primarily focus on notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Watching videos during revision is not recommended unless you need to clarify a specific forgotten concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

### Active Learning
Passive learning (listening to videos, classes) is easy but won't get you marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. Engage in active learning by asking yourself questions, covering answers in your notes, and recalling information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. If studying with a friend, quiz each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

### Selective Bookmarking
When solving questions, bookmark only genuinely important questions that you tend to forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. Avoid over-bookmarking, as you won't be able to revise 60% of bookmarked questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

## Sample 46-Day Timetable
A 46-day plan is provided for the initial syllabus completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. This timetable can be customized based on individual strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Timetable Customization
> You can choose to start with your weaker or stronger subjects. If you found subjects like OBG, Pathology, or PSM challenging in the last exam, prioritize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
>
> **Example Subject Grouping (as suggested by the speaker):**
> *   Combine big subjects with small, volatile ones (e.g., Medicine daily + Psychiatry).
> *   Correlate related subjects (e.g., Surgery related to Radio, OBG with Gynaecology).
> *   Neglected subjects like FMT and Physiology should also be incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Avoid Backlogs
> Daily revision is crucial, especially if attending offline coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. Don't let backlogs accumulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. If you can't make a perfect timetable, aim to finish 80-85% of your daily targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Choosing Study Sources
Stick to one primary study source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. Do not change your platform or notes based on what others are doing or due to minor updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. Your goal is to use the source that best suits your learning style and helps you crack the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

> [!INFO] Evaluating Platforms
> If unsure between platforms (e.g., DAMS vs. Prepladder for question banks), try solving 5-10 free questions from both to see which feels more comfortable and aligns with your learning style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

## Motivation and Mindset for the Next 3 Months
*   **Write Your Desired Score and Purpose**: Write down your target score (e.g., 151+) and your personal reason for clearing the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. This purpose should be visible to you every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.
*   **Embrace Failures**: Failures are a natural part of life and this journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. Learn from them and move forward with a positive mindset and a smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.
*   **"It's not over until you win"**: Keep this quote as a constant reminder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Avoid Unnecessary Distractions
> Don't get scattered or overwhelmed by trivial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>. Focus on studying, revising notes, and solving questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. Do not change your source of study based on external influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. The exam pattern change for July was an anomaly, and the next exam is unlikely to be tougher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

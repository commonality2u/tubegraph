Dermatophytes are a group of fungi characterized by their involvement of the "derma," specifically affecting the skin, hair, and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>. Unlike many other fungi, dermatophytes do not cause systemic infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. This distinguishes them from fungi like [[Cryptococcal Meningitis and Diagnosis | Cryptococcus]] and [[Dimorphic Fungi and Their Characteristics | dimorphic fungi]] (such as [[Dimorphic Fungi and Their Characteristics | Histoplasma]] and [[Dimorphic Fungi and Their Characteristics | Paracoccidioidomycosis]]), which are known for their multi-system involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

## Types of Dermatophytes

There are three primary genera of dermatophytes to remember, often abbreviated as "TME" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>:

*   **Trichophyton**: Contains the word "tri," indicating it affects all three areas: skin, hair, and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.
*   **Microsporum**: "Micro" refers to thinner structures like hair, so it affects the skin and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.
*   **Epidermophyton**: Ends with "n" for nail, indicating it affects the skin and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.

## Identification of Dermatophytes

Dermatophytes are identified based on their macroconidia (larger spores) and microconidia (smaller spores) when viewed under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>. The preferred stain for studying their culture morphology is [[Fungal Staining Techniques | lactophenol cotton blue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

### Microconidia Distribution

Microconidia are arranged in a descending order among the three genera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>:
*   **Trichophyton**: Shows the maximum number of microconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.
*   **Microsporum**: Has fewer microconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   **Epidermophyton**: Has the least or absent microconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

### Macroconidia Shapes

The shapes of macroconidia are distinct for each genus, following the mnemonic "PSC" (Priti Sharma Channel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>:
*   **Trichophyton (T)**: **P**encil-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>.
*   **Microsporum (M)**: **S**pindle-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>. These are also described as fusiform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.
*   **Epidermophyton (E)**: **C**lub-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.

### KOH Mount

For samples containing keratin (like skin, hair, and nails), a 10% KOH (potassium hydroxide) mount is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. KOH digests the keratin, allowing the fungal elements to be more easily visualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. Although specific fungal appearances in KOH (like "spaghetti and meatball") are noted for other fungi like *Malassezia furfur* (the cause of tinea versicolor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>, the KOH mount itself is a general technique for dermatological samples.

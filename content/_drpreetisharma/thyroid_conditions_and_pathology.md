Thyroid conditions encompass a range of disorders affecting the thyroid gland, from benign enlargements to various types of cancers. [[Differential diagnosis in pathology | Diagnosis]] often involves clinical examination, imaging, and [[Histological and Cytological Features in Pathology | pathological analysis]], including biopsy and FNAC.

## Non-Toxic Goiter
Non-toxic goiter presents as a symmetrically enlarged thyroid gland, often with discomfort during swallowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Patients typically do not exhibit symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism, indicating a euthyroid state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Thyroid Histology and Cell Origins
A normal thyroid gland consists of follicles lined by follicular epithelial cells, which contain pink colloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Follicular Epithelial Cells**: These are the origin of papillary, follicular, and anaplastic thyroid cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Parafollicular C Cells**: These cells are clustered outside the follicles and release calcitonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Medullary thyroid cancer arises from these cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, and its tumor marker is calcitonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Thyroid FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology)
Thyroid FNAC is a common diagnostic procedure.
*   **Adequacy Criteria (Bethesda System)**: A thyroid FNAC is considered adequate if it contains at least six follicles, with each follicle having a minimum of ten cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Exceptions to Adequacy Rule**:
    *   If malignant cells are seen, a report must be given regardless of cell count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
    *   In cases of colloid goiter, where primarily fluid (colloid) is aspirated, the report is still given as "colloid goiter" without needing adequate cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   In inflammation (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis), where inflammatory cells dominate, the report is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Bethesda System**: This is the classification system used for reporting thyroid FNAC findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Thyroid Cancers and Their Features

### Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid
Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Key Pathological Features**:
    *   **Psammoma Bodies**: Random blue, calcium deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   **Orphan Annie Eye Nuclei**: Optically clear nuclei that appear white, an artifact due to formalin fixation; seen on biopsy but not on FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
    *   **True Papillae**: Finger-like projections with a fibrovascular core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
    *   **Intranuclear Inclusions (Intranuclear Cytoplasmic Inclusions - INCI)**: Pink cytoplasmic material within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
    *   **Intranuclear Grooves (Coffee Bean Nuclei)**: A line or groove going through the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
    *   **Chewing Gum Colloid**: Stretched-out pink colloid material seen on FNAC, due to the sticky nature of colloid being pulled through a thin needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Prognosis**: Excellent prognosis with nearly 100% survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Associations**: Can be associated with radiation exposure, especially as the most common thyroid cancer linked to radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. It can also follow Hashimoto's thyroiditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   [[Genetic alterations in thyroid cancer | Genetic Alterations]]: Most commonly associated with BRAF V600E mutation and RET/PTC fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

### Follicular Carcinoma Thyroid
*   [[Genetic alterations in thyroid cancer | Genetic Alterations]]: Most commonly associated with RAS mutations, followed by PTEN, PI3K, and PAX8-PPARγ mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

### Medullary Carcinoma Thyroid
*   [[Genetic alterations in thyroid cancer | Genetic Alterations]]: Associated with RET mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
    *   RET mutation results in medullary thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
    *   RET/PTC fusion, however, is associated with papillary thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
    *   Loss of function of the RET gene can lead to Hirschsprung disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.
*   **Pathological Features**: Characterized by amyloid deposits, which are pink, amorphous material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis**: Amyloid can be confirmed by Congo Red stain, which shows apple-green birefringence under polarized light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Associations**: Associated with MEN (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia) syndromes, particularly MEN 2A and 2B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

### Anaplastic Carcinoma Thyroid
*   **Prognosis**: Has the worst prognosis among thyroid cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

## Graves' Disease (Hyperthyroidism)
Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition causing hyperthyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.
*   **Clinical Features**: Nervousness, muscle weakness, heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss, palpitations, menstrual irregularities, warm moist skin, and exophthalmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
*   **Antibodies**: Characterized by the presence of anti-TSH receptor antibodies (TSIs or Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins), which stimulate the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. The old name for these antibodies was LATS (Long Acting Thyroid Stimulators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.
*   **Hypersensitivity**: Classified as a Type II hypersensitivity reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>, though sometimes it's now considered Type V hypersensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.
*   **Pathological Features on Biopsy**:
    *   **Follicular Hyperplasia**: Increased number of follicular cells due to overactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
    *   **Scalloping of Colloid**: The colloid appears "scooped out" or eaten away, reflecting high metabolic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
    *   **Beefy Red Appearance**: The thyroid gland appears enlarged and beefy red due to increased vascularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.
    *   **Pseudo Papillae**: Projections that lack a fibrovascular core, unlike true papillae seen in papillary carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.

## Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (Hypothyroidism)
Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition causing hypothyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Pathological Features**:
    *   **Dense Lymphoid Infiltrate with Germinal Centers**: Significant infiltration of lymphocytes forming germinal centers, mimicking a lymph node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. This inflammation destroys thyroid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
    *   **Hürthle Cells (Askanazy Cells)**: Large, pink, eosinophilic follicular cells that undergo oncocytic change as a compensatory reaction to thyroid destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

## Riedel's Thyroiditis
This is a rare condition characterized by extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland, making it very hard on palpation and often mimicking cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.

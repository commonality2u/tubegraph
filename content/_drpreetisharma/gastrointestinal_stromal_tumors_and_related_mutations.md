Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) are mesenchymal or stromal tumors that can occur in the stomach and intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. They are more commonly found in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A patient with GIST may present with upper GI pain and tar stools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. An upper GI endoscopy might reveal a firm, smooth, yellowish submucosal mass in the [[medical_conditions_related_to_esophagus_and_stomach | stomach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Pathology
Histologically, GIST often shows spindle cells on biopsy, indicating its mesenchymal or stromal origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Cell of Origin
GIST arises from the cells of Cajal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. These cells are normally known as the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Key Mutations
Specific mutations in the cells of Cajal contribute to GIST development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>:
*   **Most Common Mutation:** CD117 or c-KIT mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Other Mutations:**
    *   PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor) mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
    *   SDH (Succinate Dehydrogenase) mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, which is typically seen in pediatric GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Molecular Mechanism
The CD117 or c-KIT mutation in Cajal cells leads to an increase in tyrosine kinase activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Diagnostic Markers
*   **Most Sensitive Marker:** c-KIT or CD117 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Specific Marker:** DOG1 (Diagnostic Of GIST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Treatment
While surgery is typically performed for tumors, a targeted drug treatment for GIST is the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Imatinib is also used in other conditions like CML (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) involving the Philadelphia chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) are a common topic in medical examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. They are mesenchymal or stromal tumors characterized by elongated spindle cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, arising from below the mucosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A patient with GIST, such as a 55-year-old woman, may present with upper gastrointestinal (GI) pain and tar stools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Endoscopic and Histological Findings
*   **Endoscopy**: An upper GI endoscopy might reveal a firm, smooth, yellowish submucosal mass in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Biopsy**: Biopsy typically shows spindle cells, confirming it as a mesenchymal or stromal tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Pathogenesis
*   **Location**: GISTs can occur in the stomach or intestine, but they are more commonly found in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Cell of Origin**: The tumors originate from the cells of Cajal, which are known as the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Mutations**: GISTs are associated with specific mutations:
    *   **CD117/KIT Mutation**: This is the most common mutation seen in GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. It leads to an increase in tyrosine kinase activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. CD117/KIT is also the most sensitive marker for GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   **PDGF Mutation**: Another mutation that can be seen is Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha (PDGFRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
    *   **SDH Mutation**: Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations are typically observed in pediatric GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

## Diagnosis
*   **Markers**:
    *   **Sensitive Marker**: CD117/KIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>
    *   **Specific Marker**: DOG1 (Diagnostic of GIST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>

## Treatment
While surgery is the ideal treatment for GIST, a specific drug, Imatinib, is used for medical management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. It is also used in the treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The mechanism of action of cholera toxin is a frequently tested topic, with questions related to *Vibrio* species appearing annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## Cholera Toxin Overview
*Vibrio cholerae* primarily produces two toxins: cholera toxin and zonula occludens toxins (ZOT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. These toxins contribute to the characteristic "rice water stools" associated with cholera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

### Cholera Toxin Fragments
Cholera toxin consists of two main fragments: fragment A and fragment B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   **Fragment B** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>:
    *   Responsible for binding to intestinal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
    *   Specifically binds to GM1 ganglioside on the intestinal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Fragment A** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>:
    *   Responsible for the mechanism of action intracellularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
    *   Activates adenylate cyclase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
    *   This activation leads to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, which causes secretion of water and electrolytes into the lumen, resulting in diarrhea.

### Related *Vibrio* Species and Characteristics
*   **Vibrio parahaemolyticus**: This species is known to exhibit the Kanagawa phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   **Culture Media**: The selective culture media for *Vibrio* is TCBS (Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts Sucrose) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
    *   The 'S' in TCBS stands for sucrose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
    *   *Vibrio cholerae* is a sucrose fermenter, which results in a yellow color on TCBS media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. Other *Vibrio* species are generally not sucrose fermenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
    *   The indicator used in TCBS media is bromothymol blue (BTB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
*   **String Test**: *Vibrio cholerae* is positive for the string test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Other organisms positive for the string test include [[giardia_lamblia | Giardia lamblia]] and [[klebsiella_species_characteristics | Klebsiella]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

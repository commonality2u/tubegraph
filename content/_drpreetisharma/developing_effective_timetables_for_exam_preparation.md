Preparing for competitive medical exams like NEET PG 2025 requires a structured approach due to uncertainties surrounding exam dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is currently impossible to predict an accurate exam date due to past postponements and uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Therefore, the best approach is to create a comfortable plan that can be adjusted as more information becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Waiting for the official date is not advisable, as it often comes too close to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Recommended Study Plan: The 65-Day Schedule

A 65-day plan is suggested as a comprehensive approach to [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | exam preparation and strategy]] for students, including those who have taken a drop year or are currently interning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Customizing the Timetable
The 65-day plan is adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>:
*   For interns, it is recommended to add 2-3 extra days for long subjects and one extra day for short subjects to accommodate their schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Working doctors or interns should heavily rely on rapid revision videos, as completing main videos is nearly impossible without studying 12 hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Main videos should only be used to clarify specific difficult topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   The timetable can be customized by adding 5-6 extra days, extending it to a 75-day plan if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   Flexibility is key; a backlog of Â±10 days is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Subject Allocation (Approximate Days)
This schedule aims to balance subjects and include occasional Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Anatomy: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
*   ENT: 3 days (due to increasing difficulty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   Pathology: 5 days (rapid revision recommended due to extensive content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   Microbiology: 4 days (rapid revision recommended) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>
*   Short subjects (e.g., Derma, Anesthesia, Radiology): 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>
*   PSM: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days (includes GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   Ob-Gyn: 6 days (first read needs to be extensive with MCQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   Ophthalmology: 3 days (Neuro-Ophthalmology is challenging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
*   Pharmacology: 5 days (4 days + 1 extra for GT analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Physiology: 2 days (best studied after other subjects as it covers many topics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>

### Integrating Medicine
Instead of studying Medicine for a long stretch, it's advised to dedicate 1 to 1.5 hours to it daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This approach makes it less overwhelming and helps integrate concepts with other subjects (e.g., studying cardiac pathology alongside the cardiac system in Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. It demands significant [[time_management_and_study_schedule_for_fmge | discipline]] and requires a fixed time slot daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Key Study Strategies

### Volatile Topics and the "20th Notebook"
Create a "20th notebook" or "chy copy" dedicated to volatile topics and Grand Test mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Content:** This notebook should only list topic names, not extensive notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. For example, "Incubation periods read from Rapid revision" or "Hepatitis B graph from Rapid revision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Personalization:** Make your own notebook as what one person forgets differs from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Do not rely on someone else's volatile topic list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** This list will be crucial for quick revision in the final 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Subject-wise vs. System-wise Study
*   **System-wise:** Recommended for those on their second, third, or fourth revision who have completed the entire syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Subject-wise:** Essential for freshers, interns, or those attempting the exam for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Studying system-wise initially can lead to missing out on general concepts (e.g., General Pathology, General Microbiology, General Pharmacology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The first read or revision should follow a subject-wise timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Daily Study Routine
A structured daily routine is critical for [[daily_targets_and_time_management_for_medical_exams | time management]]:
*   **Morning (1 hour):** Dedicated to MCQs using a custom module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
    *   Initially, focus on subjects already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
    *   Once a full revision is done, this becomes a "mini Grand Test" covering all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Night (1 hour prior to sleep):** Dedicated to Medicine videos/notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Treat it like a consistent clinical posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Active vs. Passive Learning:** After the initial viewing of videos for understanding, shift to self-study using notes and active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. Re-watching videos repeatedly can lead to overconfidence without true active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### Revisions
*   The first reading should be extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   Subsequent revisions should be narrower, moving from rapid revision to filtered topics and finally to just volatile topics in the last 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

### Utilizing Rapid Revision Videos
*   For subjects like Pathology and Microbiology, rapid revision videos (approx. 20 and 15 hours respectively) are highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   If you've previously used a version (e.g., RR 5.0), stick to it and consult the PDF for topics added in newer versions (e.g., RR 6.0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   New users should directly go for the latest rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   Rapid revision notes can solve 85-90% of the main QBank questions; any gaps can be filled by referring to main videos for specific tough topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

### Purpose of Grand Tests
GTs are not about the score, but about identifying areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
*   **Initial Frequency:** Three GTs in 65 days is a good starting point for students not yet comfortable with their syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Increased Frequency:** If comfortable, take a GT every 15 days or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Analysis:** Focus on analyzing incorrect answers, questions where you were confused, and even correct answers (to quickly review explanations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

### Analyzing GT Scores
*   **Subject-wise analysis:** Identify which subjects have low scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. If pathology questions are wrong despite studying, analyze specific topics within pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **Question type analysis:** Determine if mistakes are factual or clinical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. Strengthening factual subjects (e.g., Microbiology, Pharmacology, first/second-year subjects) can significantly boost GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **McQ Management:** If scores don't improve despite subject revision, increase the number of daily MCQs (e.g., from 40 to 60 or 80) to improve [[time_management_during_exams | McQ attempt and time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   **Recall:** If recall is an issue, revise notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   **Silly Mistakes:** Solve more questions to reduce silly errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.

> [!tip] The GT score is a byproduct of your approach. Focus on the analysis and addressing weaknesses, and the score will improve automatically. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>

### Overcoming Fear of Grand Tests
*   **Confront the fear:** The only way to overcome the fear of GTs is by taking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Reframing failure:** It's better to make mistakes and "fail" in GTs now than in the actual NEET PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.
*   **Focus on learning, not scores:** Keep your GT scores private if you wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. The goal is to identify and correct mistakes, not to achieve a specific number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
*   **Alternative approach:** If GTs are too intimidating, start by creating mixed-bag custom modules of 50 questions daily and track your percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. Once comfortable, then attempt a full GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

## General Advice

### Discipline and Willpower
*   Creating a timetable is easy; following it requires discipline and willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   Avoid making a new timetable every day; stick to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Implement "time boxes" to allocate specific time to studies, internship, social media, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Prioritizing Health
*   Health (physical and mental) should always be the top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
*   Avoid mental exhaustion during the open-ended preparation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Source Management
*   **Teacher Selection:** Choose a teacher from whom you understand concepts and whose teaching helps you achieve a high strike rate (above 80%) in questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   **Notes and QBank:** Focus primarily on notes and a reliable QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. Do not complicate the process by chasing too many sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.
*   **Platform Loyalty:** Stick to one platform for notes and videos to avoid confusion, even if you mix and match teachers for different subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Free GTs:** Attempt Grand Tests from every platform if they are free, as different examiners create them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.

### Memorization Techniques for Volatile Subjects
*   For subjects like Biochemistry, Pharmacology, and Microbiology, frequent revision is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   Employ "Back to Basics" school-like techniques, such as covering notes and actively asking yourself questions to recall information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

> [!warning] Starting today, not tomorrow. If you can't start studying immediately, at least organize your study space to prepare for tomorrow morning. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>

Success in exams like the FMGE relies heavily on consistent revision and dedicated multiple-choice question (MCQ) practice, which are considered more crucial than merely consuming content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Role of Revision

Revision is a critical component of [[exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation strategies]] for the FMGE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Without completing the syllabus within a 60-day initial study period, multiple revisions are not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The key to cracking the exam is the number of revisions undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

A structured revision plan typically involves three phases:
*   Revision 1: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Revision 2: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Revision 3: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

This phased approach aims to extend preparation until approximately December 15th, with flexibility to adjust based on the official exam date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

For stronger subjects, identified by scoring above 80% in a Q bank, [[choosing_between_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_for_different_subjects | rapid revision]] videos can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. However, for weaker subjects or topics where scores are below 80% in a Q bank, referring to main videos is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Specifically, for [[pathology_and_microbiology_mcqs | Pathology and Microbiology]], it is recommended to use only rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The [[role_of_rapid_revision_in_fmge_success | rapid revision]] for Pathology is approximately 19 hours and for Microbiology is 16 hours, designed to be comprehensive yet concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Importance of MCQ Practice

Incorporating [[importance_of_question_banks_and_mcqs_in_exam_preparation | MCQs]] alongside theory is crucial for effective preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Aspirants should aim to practice 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For those new to MCQ practice, it's advised to gradually increase the number of questions daily, starting from a lower base (e.g., increasing by 15-20 questions per day) until the target of 100-120 is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Regular MCQ practice, along with the number of revisions, is considered the key to success in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Daily Custom Modules

To maintain touch with previously studied subjects and prevent forgetting, a daily [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | custom module]] of 30 questions should be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. These modules should be a "mixed bag" drawing from all subjects finished up to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This casual test helps identify areas of weakness without the need for extensive writing or bookmarking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This practice, taking about 30 minutes, helps students stay connected with past material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

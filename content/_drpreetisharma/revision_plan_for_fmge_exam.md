Dr. Preeti Sharma outlines a comprehensive [[planning_and_strategy_for_fmge_exam_preparation | plan and strategy]] for the upcoming December 2024 FMGE exam, specifically focusing on a structured revision approach following an initial 60-day study period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This strategy is applicable for both first-time examinees and those who did not achieve a score of 150 in the June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Overall Revision Structure

The [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategy | strategy]] divides the revision phase into three distinct periods, totaling approximately 75 days, leading up to around December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>:
*   **Revision 1**: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   **Revision 2**: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> (Correction from transcript: "Revision 2 5 days, Revision 3 15 days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The speaker then clarifies "roughly taking it up till December 15th" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Given the total days, 45+15+15=75 days, implying a total of 75 days for revision in three phases, the numbers likely intended to be 45, 15, and 15 days, or the 5 and 15 are flexible for the second and third revision. The speaker later states "three divisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> for the future revision plan.)
*   **Revision 3**: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

The exact arrangement of the revision plan may be adjusted once the precise exam date is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that "more than the real content, it's a revision game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, and the key to cracking the exam is the number of revisions and MCQs practiced daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Utilizing Revision Techniques

### Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision
The choice between main videos and [[fmge_rapid_revision_techniques | rapid revision]] depends on a student's proficiency in a subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>:
*   **Rapid Revision**: Recommended for subjects where a student scores above 80% in their Q bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Main Videos**: Essential for weaker subjects or topics where a student scores less than 80% in their Q bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

For Pathology and Microbiology, it is explicitly advised to use only [[fmge_rapid_revision_techniques | rapid revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Dr. Sharma's rapid revision for Pathology on PrepLadder is 19 hours, and Microbiology is 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. It is suggested to watch approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day at speeds of 1.5x to 1.75x, or even 2x for Pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Consistent Daily Practice
A crucial aspect of the [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | preparation strategy]] is the consistent practice of Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Target MCQs**: Aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Gradual Increase**: If current practice is lower, gradually increase the number by 15-20 MCQs per day to reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Daily engagement with past subjects is maintained by performing a "casual test" at the end of each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This involves creating a custom module of 30 mixed-bag questions from all subjects covered up to that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This lighthearted test helps prevent forgetting previously studied material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Importance of Grand Tests (GTs)

Grand tests are integrated into the study and revision [[timetable_for_fmge_preparation | timetable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Two full days are allocated specifically for Grand Tests within the 60-day study plan, where a full day is dedicated to taking the test and reviewing it thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

*   **GT Number One**: Scheduled for September 8th, after covering 15 out of 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **GT Number Two**: Scheduled for September 21st, marking the end of the initial 60-day study phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

These GTs are crucial for assessment and identifying areas for improvement, even if all subjects haven't been completed yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

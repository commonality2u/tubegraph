Electron microscopy can be a valuable tool in diagnosing certain conditions, particularly through the visualization of characteristic cellular components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.

## Role in Identifying Neuroendocrine Tumors

When tissue samples are examined under an electron microscope, the presence of neurosecretory granules can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. The identification of these granules is indicative of a neuroendocrine tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. An example where this is useful is in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

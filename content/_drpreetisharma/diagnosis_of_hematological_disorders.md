[[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | Diagnostic techniques]] for hematological disorders involve analyzing various cellular and protein components in the blood and bone marrow, as well as considering clinical presentations.

## Anemias

### Iron Deficiency Anemia
Patients with iron deficiency anemia may present with spoon-shaped nails, a condition known as koilonychia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This type of anemia is associated with hookworm infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.

### B12 Deficiency (Megaloblastic Anemia)
[[blood_film_analysis | Hyperpigmentation]] of the palms and knuckles can indicate B12 deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. This condition may be associated with *Diphyllobothrium* infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.

### Spherocytosis
Spherocytes are round cells lacking central pallor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. The most common cause is autoimmune hemolytic anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>, followed by [[hereditary_spherocytosis_and_blood_film_analysis | hereditary spherocytosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. The Eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test is used for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.

### G6PD Deficiency
G6PD deficiency is characterized by the presence of Heinz bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a> and classical bite cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a> in blood film analysis.

### Sickle Cell Anemia and Thalassemia
Both sickle cell anemia and thalassemia can cause a "crew cut hair-on-end" appearance in skull radiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. In sickle cell anemia, classical sickle cells are visible in the blood film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.

### Thalassemia
The Nest of Test (NEST) is a diagnostic test for thalassemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. In this tube test, if the lines are absent, thalassemia is suspected, while present lines indicate a normal result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

## Leukemias

### Blood Cell Identification
Identifying different blood cell types is crucial for diagnosing leukemias:
*   **Neutrophil:** Characterized by 3-5 lobes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Lymphocyte:** Appears as a simple round cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.
*   **Monocyte:** Has a kidney-shaped nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>. Monocytes are elevated in malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>.
*   **Eosinophil:** Orange-looking cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Eosinophils are increased in parasitic infections (e.g., hookworm, Giardia) and allergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>.
*   **Basophil:** Blue cells with blue-black granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. Basophils are increased in CML (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.

### Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
*   **AML M3 (Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia):** Characterized by Faggot cells (cells with maximum granules) and prominent Auer rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. It is the only leukemia that can cause Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a> and is treated with Vitamin A (all-trans retinoic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. It is associated with translocation 15;17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

### Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
CLL often shows smudge cells in peripheral smears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>, described as having a "convent school girl appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.

### Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
CML is characterized by a "college girl appearance" or "garden party appearance" where all cell lines (neutrophils, myelocytes, blasts) are visible and benign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

### Burkitt Lymphoma
Burkitt lymphoma is often seen in African children presenting with jaw swelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>, due to the endemic presence of the Epstein-Barr virus in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>. Microscopic examination reveals a "starry sky appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>. It is associated with translocation 8;14, 8;22, or 8;any even number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.

## Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma, a plasma cell tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>, primarily affects elderly individuals (60-75 years old) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a> and is associated with lytic bony lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. However, lytic bony lesions alone are not definitive, as they can also be seen in conditions like Langerhans cell histiocytosis in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>.

### Peripheral Smear Findings
*   **Rouleaux Formation:** Red blood cells appear stacked like coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.
*   **Russell Bodies:** Intracystoplasmic bodies seen in plasma cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>, composed of IgG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.
*   **Dutcher Bodies:** Intranuclear bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>, also composed of IgG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.
*   **Mott Cells:** Plasma cells resembling a mulberry or moat, present everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>, composed of IgG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Flame Cells:** Plasma cells with a characteristic "flame" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>. Unlike other inclusions, these are associated with IgA antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

### Confirmatory Diagnosis
*   **M Spike (Monoclonal Spike):** Seen on protein analysis, indicating an increase in monoclonal antibodies, most commonly IgG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. This spike appears in the gamma region of the protein electrophoresis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.
*   **Genetics:** Associated with deletion 13q and translocation 11;14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.

### Bone Marrow Aspiration Needles
*   **Salhaaj Needle:** Characterized by a side screw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.
*   **Klima Needle:** Has a simple appearance without a side screw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.

Approaching an exam requires a delicate balance between unwavering confidence and practical caution. It's normal to experience panic and palpitations as the exam day approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, adopting a positive mindset and a strategic approach can significantly impact performance.

## Pre-Exam Day Essentials

*   **Final Study Wrap-up:** Conclude your studying maximum by 7-7:30 PM the evening before the exam to ensure a good night's sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
    *   If you have a personal volatile list, review that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Otherwise, scan images, especially from pathology, microbiology, orthopaedics, and radiology, as they often feature classical spotter images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   Avoid starting new subjects or comprehensive revisions like medicine at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **Document Checklist:** Confirm your admit card and a valid ID proof are ready. Ensure the name on your ID matches the admit card exactly, with no spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. You do not need to paste a photograph on the admit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Keep your ID in an easily accessible and secure place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Locate Your Centre:** Confirm the exact location of your exam centre in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Plan to arrive well before the entry time (Paper 1 entry starts at 7 AM and closes at 8:30 AM) to allow your heart rate to normalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Exam Day Mindset

Maintaining the right [[Anxiety and positivity management | mindset]] is crucial for optimal performance.

### Managing Expectations
Historically, exams often feature one paper that is slightly easier and one that is more difficult, maintaining an overall balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. If Paper 1 seems tough, do not lose hope; Paper 2 might be relatively easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Focus on the current paper without dwelling on the previous one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Handling Challenging Questions
Expect a few "bouncers" â€“ questions (around 10-20 per paper) that are exceptionally difficult or obscure, even for experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These questions are designed to maintain the competitive level of the exam and are not meant for everyone to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Do not let them demotivate you or lower your [[Overcoming anxiety and staying motivated during FMGE preparation | motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If you encounter such a question, make an educated guess and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Your primary focus should be on avoiding silly mistakes in the easier questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Avoiding Silly Mistakes and Overthinking
Negativity can lead to silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Human error is unavoidable, but panic and [[Anxiety and positivity management | anxiety]] can exacerbate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

When answering questions:
*   Adopt an "on-off" mode: focus entirely on the current question, attempt it, then mentally "switch off" from it and move to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   Spend about 45 seconds analyzing a question and marking the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   Do not change your answers in the last few minutes due to overthinking or panic; this often leads to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Trusting Your Gut Feeling
Your first gut feeling is often correct, especially when you are not under immense pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Trust this initial instinct and avoid overthinking, which can create problems both in life and in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

### Maintaining Positivity and Self-Belief
*   **Positive Affirmations:** Constantly affirm that the paper will be easy and that you will avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Believe in yourself and your preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Count Your Blessings:** Focus on the support you have and believe that good things will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This mindset will normalize your heart rate and prevent silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Confidence, Not Overconfidence:** Aim to be confident until you reach the exam hall and sit down. This [[Time management during exams | confidence]] will help you reach the venue. Once at the computer, shift to a practical, sane mindset, focusing on reading every question and option carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **Rule Out Options:** If unsure about an answer, try to rule out incorrect options to indirectly arrive at the correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Pacing:** Some questions will be quick one-liners, while others will be lengthy. Don't worry if a question takes longer than the average time; the paper is balanced, and other quick questions will compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. A slight lag in the first 15 minutes is normal as you settle in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Between Papers
Crucially, do not discuss Paper 1 with anyone during the break before Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Hearing about questions you missed or got wrong can severely impact your focus and [[Overcoming anxiety and staying motivated during FMGE preparation | performance]] on the second paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Stay away from discussions and only focus on light refreshments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Beyond the Exam
Remember that this exam is just a formality, not a determinant of your true worth as a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. You have already faced many challenges, and this is just another small one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. People who truly support you will stand by you regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Do not worry about the opinions of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. There is more to life than a single exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

Embrace every challenge with a smile and confidence. Remain positive until the very end of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

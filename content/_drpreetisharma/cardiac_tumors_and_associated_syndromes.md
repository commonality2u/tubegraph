## Cardiac Tumors

### General Overview
The most common cardiac tumor overall is secondary metastatic cancer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>

### Primary Cardiac Tumors
Primary cardiac tumors are classified by age group and malignancy:
*   **Adults** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
    *   **Benign:** Myxoma is the most common primary benign cardiac tumor in adults. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
        *   Typically occurs in the left atrium. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>
        *   Gross appearance: Jelly-like mass. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>

        *   Histopathology: Characterized by "spider cells" which appear white due to glycogen content, making them PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) positive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>
    *   **Malignant:** Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common primary malignant cardiac tumor in children. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>

### Cardiac Valvular Tumors
*   **Papillary fibroelastoma (PFE):** This tumor commonly affects cardiac valves, appearing as a papillary, sea anemone-like structure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> It is a frequently asked question in certain medical exams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>

## Associated Syndromes with Cardiac Involvement

### [[genetic_disorders_and_syndromes_related_to_pathology | Tuberous Sclerosis]]
[[genetic_disorders_and_syndromes_related_to_pathology | Tuberous Sclerosis]] is a [[genetic_disorders_and_syndromes_related_to_pathology | genetic disorder]] associated with Rhabdomyoma, intellectual disability, and seizures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   **Genes:** TSC1 (Hamartin protein) and TSC2 (Tuberin protein) are located on chromosomes 9 and 16, respectively. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   **Clinical Manifestations (ASH LEAF mnemonic):**
    *   **A**sh Leaf Spot: Hypopigmented skin lesions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
    *   **S**hae Green Patch: Leathery, thick skin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
    *   **H**eart: Rhabdomyoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>
    *   **L**ungs: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a tumor involving lymphatic channels, blood vessels, and smooth muscle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>
    *   **E**pilepsy/Brain: Cortical tubers and Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA), explaining intellectual disability and seizures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
    *   **A**ngiomyolipoma (AML) of the kidney. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
    *   **F**ace: Angiofibroma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>
*   All these tumors are considered **hamartomatous**. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>

### Naxos Syndrome
[[genetic_disorders_and_syndromes_related_to_pathology | Naxos Syndrome]] is associated with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), woolly hair, and keratoderma (thick palms and soles). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>
*   It is caused by a defect in the plakoglobin gene. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>
*   In ARVC, the right ventricle shows fatty replacement. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>

## Cardiac Muscle Diseases and Pathological Findings

### Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)
*   Characterized by dilation of all four cardiac chambers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>
*   **Genetic Alteration:** Most commonly associated with mutations in the Titin gene, one of the largest proteins in the body. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>
*   **Histopathology:** Can show a "ninja star appearance" in the nucleus. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>
*   **Causes:** Idiopathic in 50% of cases; alcohol is a very common identifiable cause. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>
*   **Distinction from Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM):** Unlike HCM, DCM does not exhibit a "banana-shaped heart" or myocyte disarray. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
*   **Genetic Alteration:** Caused by mutations in the myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>
*   **Gross Appearance:** Characterized by a "banana-shaped heart" due to asymmetric septal hypertrophy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>
*   **Histopathology:** Shows disarray, or "helter-skelter," of cardiac muscle fibers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a> This disarray is a key diagnostic feature, and its absence rules out HCM. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>

## Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Complications

### Diagnosis and Early Changes
*   **Histology:** MI leads to coagulative necrosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>
*   **TTC Staining:** Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) stain is used to detect MI within the first four hours, before gross changes are visible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>
    *   **Principle:** TTC stains lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which is abundant in viable heart tissue. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>
    *   **Normal Heart:** Stains brick red due to presence of LDH. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>
    *   **Infarcted Area:** Appears pale because LDH is lost due to necrosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>

### Complications Post-MI
*   **Early Complications (3-7 days post-MI):** Rupture (e.g., ventricular wall rupture) is most likely because the tissue is necrotic but not yet fully scarred or repaired by granulation tissue. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>
*   **Late Complications (19-21 days or 3 weeks post-MI):** Autoimmune pericarditis, also known as Dressler's Syndrome, can occur. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>
*   **Reperfusion Injury:** Occurs when blood flow is restored to ischemic tissue (e.g., after angioplasty for MI). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>
    *   **Mechanism:** Mediated by an influx of free radicals, inflammatory cells, and calcium. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>
    *   **Pathological Finding:** High calcium leads to excessive muscle contraction, resulting in "contraction band necrosis." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>
    *   **Incorrect Statement:** Granulation tissue is not a feature of reperfusion injury; it is part of the later repair process. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>

## Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)

*   Often an asymptomatic or incidental finding, presenting with a mid-systolic click on auscultation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>
*   Also known as "floppy valve syndrome" or Barlow syndrome. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>
*   **Pathology:** Characterized by myxomatous degeneration, where the valve tissue becomes jelly-like. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>
*   **Distinction:** It is typically not associated with acute rheumatic heart disease, especially if streptococcal infection markers (e.g., ASO titer) are negative. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>

## Lung and Lymph Node Pathology Relevant to Systemic Disease

### Tuberculosis (TB) Granuloma
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Patients may present with chest discomfort, night sweats, fever, cough, and cervical lymphadenopathy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>
*   **Histopathology:** Characterized by giant cells (e.g., Langhans giant cells) and a surrounding "lymphocyte collar." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>
*   **Commonality:** In countries where TB is endemic, it is a more common diagnosis than sarcoidosis for granulomatous inflammation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>
*   **Necrosis:** Caseating necrosis is more common in TB granulomas, though non-caseating can also be seen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>
*   **Occupational Link:** Silicosis (from glass or silica industries) predisposes individuals to TB and lung cancer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>

### Sarcoidosis Granuloma
*   **Diagnosis of Exclusion:** Sarcoidosis is diagnosed after ruling out other causes of granulomatous inflammation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>
*   **Key Diagnostic Criteria (beyond granuloma):** Elevated serum ACE levels, elevated calcium levels, and an increased CD4/CD8 ratio. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>
*   **Histopathology:** Characterized by "naked granulomas" (lacking a surrounding lymphocyte collar). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>
*   **Inclusions:** May contain Asteroid bodies (star-shaped) and Schaumann bodies (calcified concentric lamellae, similar to psammoma bodies). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>
    *   Asteroid bodies in sarcoidosis are **intracellular**. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>
    *   Asteroid bodies are also seen in Sporothrix (Rose Gardener's Disease), but they are **extracellular**. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>
*   **Necrosis:** Non-caseating granulomas are characteristic, though caseating can also be seen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>

### Ferruginous Bodies
*   Dumbbell-shaped, brown-colored bodies seen in the lungs after inhaling certain particles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>
*   Composed of inhaled particles (e.g., asbestos, silica, coal, cotton) coated with iron by the body. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>
*   Stain blue with Perls' Prussian blue stain due to iron content. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>
*   **Relationship to Asbestos Bodies:** All asbestos bodies are ferruginous bodies (because asbestos fibers get coated with iron), but not all ferruginous bodies are asbestos bodies (as they could be coated silica, coal, etc.). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>

## Emphysema in Children

### Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
*   **Genetic Basis:** Autosomal recessive disorder, with the gene located on chromosome 14. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Can lead to early childhood death due to lung parenchyma destruction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>
*   **Lung Pathology:** Causes panacinar emphysema, meaning destruction of all components of the acinus (respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct, and alveolar sac). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>
*   **Liver Pathology:** Can also cause cirrhosis in children. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>
*   **Histopathology in Liver:** Presents as pink intracellular droplets that are PAS positive and diastase resistant. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>

This article outlines a 60-day study plan and [[time_management_and_study_schedule_advice|strategy]] designed for students preparing for the December 2024 FMGE exam, applicable to both first-time test-takers and those aiming to improve their previous scores above 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This [[timetable_for_fmge_preparation|timetable]] spans from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Following this 60-day period, a separate [[optimizing_the_last_nine_days_before_the_exam|revision plan]] will be provided, consisting of three phases: 45 days, 5 days, and 15 days, roughly leading up to December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Core Principles of the 60-Day Plan

The 60-day [[timetable_for_fmge_preparation|timetable]] focuses on a combination of theory and practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

*   **Daily MCQs**: Aim to complete 100 to 120 [[daily_study_targets_and_discipline|MCQs]] per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If you are new to practicing [[daily_study_targets_and_discipline|MCQs]], gradually increase your daily count by 15-20 [[daily_study_targets_and_discipline|MCQs]] until you reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Study Hours**: Maintain an average of 8 to 10 [[daily_study_targets_and_discipline|hours per day]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is crucial for covering the syllabus and enabling future revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Single Source**: Utilize a single source for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Choose faculty and notes that you understand best, even if it means mixing and matching across different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Video Lectures**:
    *   **Rapid Revision Videos**: Recommended for stronger subjects where you score above 80% in your Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   **Main Videos**: Use for weaker subjects or topics where your Q-bank score is less than 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   **Pathology and Microbiology**: For these specific subjects, rapid revision videos are explicitly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Subject Block Breakdown

The subjects are divided into four integrated blocks to facilitate better understanding and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Block 1
*   Anatomy: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

### Block 3
*   Obstetrics & Gynecology (OBGY): 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   Anesthesia: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

### Block 4 (Standalone Subjects)
*   PSM: 5 days (due to increasing difficulty of questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   ENT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   Ophthalmology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
*   FMT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

### Grand Tests (GTs)
The 58 days of study are complemented by 2 days dedicated to Grand Tests (GTs), which include both taking the test and reviewing it on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **GT 1**: September 8th, after completing approximately 15 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **GT 2**: September 21st, marking the end of the 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Overall 60-Day [[Creating and following a study timetable|Timetable]]
The specific [[timetable_for_fmge_preparation|timetable]] starts on July 24th and concludes on September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The philosophy behind this structure is to focus entirely on the present 60-day plan without dwelling on past results or future anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Specific Recommendations for Pathology & Microbiology
For Pathology, the rapid revision course is approximately 19 hours, and for Microbiology, it is 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This translates to roughly 5 hours of video lectures per day. It is suggested to watch Pathology at 2x speed and Microbiology at 1.5x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Daily [[Time management and study schedule advice|Study Schedule Advice]]

To maintain focus and avoid burnout, [[time_management_and_study_schedule_advice|time boxing]] is essential, dividing your day into study, break, and chill times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

*   **Morning Routine (Before 8:00 AM)**: Take an hour to enjoy your morning routine, including about 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)**: A 3-hour stretch to build endurance for exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Short Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM)**: A half-hour to relax, close eyes, listen to music, or talk to family, but avoid social media or screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM)**: A 2.5-hour session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. By lunchtime, you will have completed 5.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM)**: A 1.5-hour break for lunch, power nap, or personal leisure, including social media use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM)**: Another 2.5-hour session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Evening Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)**: A 1-hour break, mixing outdoor time with social interaction or media as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM)**: The final 2-hour study session of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Nightly Custom MCQ Module (9:00 PM onwards)**: Before sleeping, complete a custom module of 30 mixed-bag questions from subjects already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This is a casual test, not for writing or bookmarking, intended to keep you in touch with past subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This should take approximately 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Wind Down (Until 11:00 PM - 11:30 PM)**: Relax, watch social media, or a web series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Ensure you get 8 hours of sleep, waking up around 7:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

## A Mantra for Life
> "No past guilt, no future anxiety." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>
>
> "This too shall pass. It might pass like a kidney stone; it might create a lot of pain for you; it will be painful; it might result in hematuria. So it is going to be a tough journey, but remember nothing remains constant, it will pass and better days will come." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>
>
> "God always tests those whom he feels can actually withstand that test of time and you will be on the other side very soon." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>
>
> "In the long run it is not going to matter, no one's going to come and ask you whether you cleared the fmg exam in one or two attempts. In the long run it is about your clinical skills, how well are you at actually treating a patient and how humble are you in that entire journey." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>

Embrace tough times with humility, as they contribute to greater heights in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Begin your preparation on July 24th with a positive mindset, ensuring your [[daily_study_targets_and_discipline|daily study targets]] and [[creating_and_following_a_study_timetable|study schedule]] are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

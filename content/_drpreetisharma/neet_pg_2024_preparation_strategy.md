This session is specifically designed for students appearing for NEET PG on March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Core Preparation Elements

### Daily Targets for Pathology & Microbiology
Daily targets for Pathology and Microbiology will be provided via a Google Sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. These targets are topic-wise, based on Rapid Revision (RR) videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. If you are not following the RR videos, you should cover the specified topics from your current source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Daily targets begin tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

### Kick Start Morning Sessions
Kick Start Morning sessions are designed to encourage early rising (e.g., 7:30 AM) to begin your study day early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These sessions will start after the first round of Pathology and Microbiology RR videos are completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The sessions will be MCQ-based discussions, focusing on integrated questions to make more sense of topics you've already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Kick Start Morning sessions will be held on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:18">[02:07:18]</a>.

### Video Sources: Main vs. Rapid Revision
For subjects you have already studied, if you have covered 85-90% of the material, focus on Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, for certain subjects, main videos should still be referred to:
-   **Bulky & High-Yield Subjects:** Medicine, Surgery, OBG, PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. PSM, in particular, may require main videos for in-depth information due to atypical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
-   **Weak/Nightmare Subjects:** Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. If you are weak in Anatomy, relying only on RR might be "further torture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. For subjects you are scared of, like Pharmacology, main videos can help overcome that fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.
-   Do not switch your current source if you have already studied from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.

### Previous Year Topics (PYTYs)
Focus on PYTYs as they are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. There are many helpful resources and students on Instagram who have already posted them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. For NEET PG, review PYQs from the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. For INI CET, review the last three years, as INI CET questions sometimes overlap with NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. PYQs are not the *only* solution for a good rank, but PYQ topics combined with Rapid Revision are helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
Allocate half a day for grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The effective use of this time is usually three to three and a half hours for the exam, with the rest for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
-   **Analysis:** Do not read explanations for correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Focus on analyzing incorrect answers to understand *why* you got them wrong (silly mistake, unknown topic, new information, lack of time/effort) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
-   **Frequency:** Take a GT every two weeks if you approach it positively, focusing on picking out mistakes and managing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. If GTs demotivate you, consider taking one every three weeks until you develop a positive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
-   **Baseline GT:** Take a grand test today as a baseline, without judging yourself on the score. Focus only on the incorrect explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### LRR (Last-minute Rapid Revision)
LRR sessions for NEET PG will be conducted in January and February, with an aim to finish by January to allow ample revision time for PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. NEET PG students should also attend FMG LRR sessions (e.g., from November/December) as they cover FMG PYQs and provide passive revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Study Timetable Structure
The timetable outlines three rounds of revision leading up to the exam. The PDF of the full timetable will be shared on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:49">[02:07:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:51">[02:07:51]</a>.

-   **Last Week Volatile Subjects:** Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology. Microbiology updates will be covered in LRR and daily targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

### Integrating Grand Tests and Backlogs
The timetable includes "pending" days which serve two purposes:
1.  **Backlog:** Catch up on any unfinished topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
2.  **Grand Test:** Take a GT if you have no backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
This flexible approach accounts for unforeseen circumstances like falling unwell or emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

## Question Solving Strategy
-   Solve 100-150 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
-   Focus on subject-wise and topic-wise questions as you go through each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:40">[03:04:40]</a>.
-   The time allocated for subjects in the timetable includes time for solving questions; there are no separate QBank days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:40">[03:04:40]</a>.
-   For bulky subjects (Medicine, Surgery, Gyne, PSM, Anatomy, Pharma), aim to complete the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:40">[03:04:40]</a>.
-   For short subjects and those where RR notes are sufficient, you can refer to the RR QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:40">[03:04:40]</a>.

## Strategies for Interns
Interns should follow the same subject sequence as the general timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.
-   Add an extra day or half-day to each subject's allocation to account for less study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.
-   Primarily use Rapid Revision videos and a QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. Avoid main videos during internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.
-   Focus on completing short subjects quickly (Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic, Skin) during light posting periods to gain confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.
-   Utilize daily targets for Pathology and Microbiology, fitting in 40-minute study sessions while working (e.g., inserting a cannula, making a death certificate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.

## Addressing Common Concerns

### Confidence & Past Performance
-   Confidence comes from solving questions and seeing correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   Don't dwell on past exam ranks or GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>. Treat today as a fresh start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   An exam's outcome is not solely determined by effort; external factors change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.

### "Nightmare" Subjects
-   Identify your top 3-4 nightmare subjects (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   Confront them directly by dedicating sufficient time (4-5 days), using main videos if necessary, and solving extensive questions to overcome the fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.

### Study Hours
-   10-11 hours of pure study output per day is excellent and should not be increased to avoid mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   Aim for long study stretches, like 2.5 hours, without breaks, to train your mind for exam vigilance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   Take 15-minute breaks after long stretches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.

### Integrated Time Tables
-   Integrated system-wise timetables are generally not recommended for this preparation phase, as they can lead to neglecting foundational subjects or topics not covered by systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   Daily Medicine study and Grand Tests will facilitate integration organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.

### Crash Courses and BTR
-   Crash courses, BTR (BTR stands for Better than Regular), and other rapid revision sources should be used in conjunction with your main study plan (notes, QBank, GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   They serve as supplementary tools for quick revision and condensing information, not as standalone replacements for in-depth study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.

### Note-Taking
-   Focus only on main keywords and essential information; avoid writing everything down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.

## Final Advice
-   The provided timetable accounts for potential backlogs, anxiety, and unforeseen events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   Be practical from day one; accept that some days might be less productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   Customize the timetable as per your study pattern and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.
-   It's time to take action rather than just knowing what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   For NEET PG, focus on realistic images and topics from RR videos; INI CET often includes rarer images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   Do not mix INI CET and NEET PG preparation/results; they are different exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.
-   Forget past setbacks and focus on the future with a positive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>.

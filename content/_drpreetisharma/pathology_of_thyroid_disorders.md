The thyroid gland, located in the anterior portion of the neck, can present with swelling and discomfort during swallowing when affected by various conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Normal Thyroid Histology
Normal thyroid tissue consists of follicles lined by follicular epithelial cells and containing colloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Scattered parafollicular C cells are also present, which are responsible for releasing calcitonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Thyroid Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)
Thyroid FNAC is a common diagnostic procedure. To ensure adequacy of the sample, the "Rule of 6/10" is applied: a minimum of six follicular clusters should be seen, with each cluster containing at least ten cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Exceptions to the 6/10 rule where a report can still be issued include:
*   Presence of malignancy, such as [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | papillary carcinoma thyroid]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Cases of colloid goiter, where primarily fluid or colloid is aspirated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Presence of inflammation, as seen in [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

The standardized reporting system for thyroid FNAC is the Bethesda system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Thyroid Disorders

### Non-Toxic Goiter
This condition is characterized by a symmetrical enlargement of the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Patients are typically euthyroid, meaning their thyroid hormone levels are within the normal range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Thyroid Cancers
#### [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid (PCT)]]
[[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Papillary carcinoma]] is the most common type of thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Key [[Histological and cytological appearances in pathology | histological and cytological features]] include:
*   **Papillae**: True papillae contain a fibrovascular core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Psammoma bodies**: These are calcified concentric structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Orphan Annie Eye Nuclei**: These are optically clear, ground-glass nuclei, and are an artifact of formalin fixation, thus seen on biopsy but not FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Intranuclear inclusions (Intranuclear Cytoplasmic Inclusions)**: Cytoplasm invaginates into the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Intranuclear grooves**: Also known as "coffee bean appearance," these are longitudinal grooves within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Chewing gum colloid**: Stretched-out colloid seen on FNAC due to aspiration through a thin needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

Genetic alterations associated with [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | papillary carcinoma thyroid]] include BRAF V600E mutation (most common) and RET/PTC fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. It has the best prognosis among thyroid cancers, with nearly 100% survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. It can be associated with radiation exposure (most common thyroid cancer linked to radiation) and [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

#### [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Follicular Carcinoma Thyroid]]
Associated with RAS mutations, as well as mutations in genes like P10, PI3K, PAX, and PPAR-gamma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

#### [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Medullary Carcinoma Thyroid]]
Arises from parafollicular C cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Tumor Marker**: Calcitonin, sometimes associated with amyloid deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
*   **Stain**: Congo Red stain is used to confirm amyloid, showing apple-green birefringence under a polarizing microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **Genetics**: Associated with RET gene mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. The mnemonic "RET 10 MEN" refers to the RET gene on chromosome 10, associated with [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Medullary Carcinoma Thyroid]] and Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
    *   *Note*: A RET gene mutation leads to [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Medullary Carcinoma Thyroid]], while RET/PTC fusion leads to [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
    *   Loss of function of the RET gene is associated with Hirschsprung disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

#### [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Anaplastic Carcinoma Thyroid]]
Considered to have the worst prognosis among thyroid cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

### Non-Cancerous Thyroid Disorders

#### Graves' Disease
Graves' disease is a hyperthyroid state characterized by symptoms like nervousness, muscle weakness, heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss, dyspnea, heart palpitations, and menstrual irregularities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
*   **Cause**: Presence of anti-TSH receptor antibodies (Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins - TSI), previously known as Long-Acting Thyroid Stimulators (LATS), which stimulate the thyroid to produce excess T3 and T4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.
*   **Hypersensitivity Type**: Belongs to Type II hypersensitivity reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Some newer classifications also place it under Type V hypersensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.
*   **[[Histological and cytological appearances in pathology | Histological features]]**:
    *   Follicular hyperplasia with scalloping of colloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Scalloping refers to the appearance of colloid being "scooped out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.
    *   Grossly, the gland may appear beefy red due to increased vascularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.
    *   Pseudo-papillae (lacking a fibrovascular core, unlike true papillae in [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | papillary carcinoma]]) can be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

#### [[types_and_diagnosis_of_thyroid_cancers | Hashimoto's Thyroiditis]]
This is a hypothyroid condition characterized by dense lymphoid infiltrates with germinal centers and the presence of Hurthle cells (also known as Askanazy cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. The lymphoid aggregates destroy thyroid cells, leading to hypothyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

#### Riedel's Thyroiditis
This condition is characterized by extensive fibrosis throughout the thyroid gland, making it feel very hard on palpation and mimicking cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

This article outlines a detailed study schedule and strategy for FMG students preparing for the January 20th exam, emphasizing effective time management and revision techniques. The information is based on a session conducted after Diwali, with approximately two months and one additional week available for preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## General Preparation Guidelines

*   **Study Hours**: Aim for at least 10 to 12 effective hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. "Effective hours" means actual study time after accounting for distractions and time wastage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **MCQs Alongside Theory**: Given the exam proximity, [[Utilizing Previous Year Question Papers for FMGE | practice MCQs]] daily alongside your theoretical study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision (RR) vs. Main Videos**: Focus on Rapid Revision (RR) videos and notes. Main videos should only be referred to for clarifying specific doubts or concepts that are not clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Source of Questions**: Utilize a question bank (Q bank) of your choice from any existing subscription, combined with previous year's topics (PYTs) from past papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Do not rote memorize previous year questions; focus on understanding the topics they cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Number of MCQs**: Aim for 100+ MCQs per day. If this is not immediately feasible, start with 50 and gradually increase by 5-7 questions daily to build speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Do not change your study sources at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Forgetting**: It's normal to forget; accept it as part of the learning cycle. Re-read and revise continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Make peace with the fact that not everything will stay in your mind forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **Note Highlighting**: Be very selective when highlighting notes for quick revision. Highlight only 5 main words per page to ensure efficient last-day review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **Health**: Balance physical and mental health. Incorporate 30-40 minutes of walking or relaxation daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Practice deep breathing, ensure a balanced diet, and maintain a normal heart rate through meditation or yoga if it helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. Sleep for at least six hours to ensure healthy mental functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Positivity**: Maintain a positive mindset and act as a shield against negativity from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.

## Study Schedule (Round 1: November 13th - December 24th)

This [[FMGE preparation strategy | timetable]] is designed with "no breathing space" and requires immediate implementation after the session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The suggested order can be customized based on personal preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

*   **Anatomy**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   **Orthopedics**: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
*   **Biochemistry**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>
*   **Pathology**: 3 days (November 20-22) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Focus on Rapid Revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This strategically aligns with PrepLadder's LRR sessions on November 23rd and 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Medicine**: Start daily 1 to 1.5 hours of Medicine from November 23rd, continuing until January 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The initial pathology study should cover 40-50% of medicine topics, making subsequent medicine study easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.
*   **Psychiatry**: 1 short subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
*   **ENT**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
*   **Dermatology**: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   **PSM**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Focus on main topics rather than attempting to cover everything due to the unpredictable nature of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Anesthesia**: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>
*   **Microbiology**: 3 days (December 2-4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This aligns with PrepLadder's LRR sessions on December 3rd and 4th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Surgery**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>
*   **Radiology**: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>
*   **OBG**: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
*   **Ophthalmology**: 2 days (due to complex topics like neuro-ophthalmology and squint) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   **Pharmacology**: 3 days (placed towards the end as many drug concepts are encountered while studying other subjects like Micro, OBG, and Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.
*   **Pediatrics**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>
*   **Forensic Medicine**: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>
*   **Physiology**: 2 days (last two days of the first round) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>

## Second Round of Revision (After December 24th)

This round is for a faster, more focused revision, concluding around January 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

*   **Daily Targets (Pathology & Microbiology)**: After December 24th, daily targets for Path and Micro will be provided (30-40 minutes each) to cover high-yield topics expected in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. These subjects are effectively managed outside the core 17-subject timetable in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Short Subjects (Psych, Radio, Ortho, Anesthesia, Forensic, Skin)**: Finish all six short subjects in 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **ENT & Ophthalmology**: 2.5 days for these, with half a day dedicated to a Grand Test (GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   **PSM**: 2 days to wrap up the year with this "deadly subject" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **OBGY**: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   **Surgery**: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Physiology**: 1 day (focus on quick notes, RR, LRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects**: Keep Biochemistry, Anatomy, and Pharmacology towards the end (2 days each) to aid retention closer to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## Final Week (January 13th - January 19th)

*   This period (approximately 6-7 days) should be dedicated to solving previous year questions and reviewing volatile topics from LRR sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

*   **Frequency**: Aim for a minimum of 5 Grand Tests (GTs) before the January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: GTs are primarily for:
    1.  **Time Management**: Learn to manage time effectively during the exam, especially handling the last hour with many questions to revisit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
    2.  **Identifying Weaknesses**: Focus analysis on incorrect questions. Read explanations for incorrect answers from your app or solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. For correct answers, simply refer to your notes to reinforce concepts, no need to read lengthy explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   **Score**: Do not obsess over GT scores. GTs on platforms are often tougher than the actual exam to encourage more study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. A score of 150+ in GTs might translate to 170-180+ in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
*   **Avoid GTs in Last 15 Days**: It's acceptable not to give GTs in the final 15 days to avoid unnecessary stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

## Key Mindset and Approach

*   **Self-Doubt**: Recognize that self-doubt is common among exam-going students, but it doesn't reflect your actual capabilities. Remind yourself of your past achievements (MBBS, schooling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Outcome vs. Process**: Focus on daily tasks and processes rather than worrying about the exam outcome or unpredictable factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Blind Faith in Timetable**: Follow the provided [[Time Management and Timetable Creation for FMGE | timetable]] strictly, aiming to finish subjects within the allocated days without accumulating backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.
*   **Customization**: For those aiming for higher scores (200+), try to finish subjects 1-2 days earlier than suggested in the timetable to create extra time for an additional revision round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.
*   **Existing Timetables**: If you are already following an existing [[exam_preparation_strategy_for_fmge | study schedule]] that is working for you, stick to it. Do not abandon it for this one, but extract good points from this schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Weak Subjects**: For subjects you find difficult (e.g., Gynecology), even if you don't like them, commit to studying their Rapid Revision notes for the allocated days. Focus on completing the notes rather than mastering the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Starting from Zero**: If you feel like you haven't studied much, adopt a "starting from zero" mindset. It's possible to clear the FMGE by studying diligently in the last 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Leaving a Subject**: Ideally, cover all 19 subjects. If you decide to leave one, at least cover its LRR (Last Revision Round) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
*   **PYQs from Other Exams**: Include NEET PG and AIIMS CET Previous Year Questions/Topics (PYQs) from the last 3-4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.
*   **Mixed Bag Exam**: The exam is expected to be a mixed bag of one-liner and clinical questions, similar to previous patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: Your own dedication and the desire to change your life after January 20th should be your primary motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. Visualize your success, like giving an interview after passing the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.

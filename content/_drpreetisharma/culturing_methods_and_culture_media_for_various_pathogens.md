Culturing methods and specific media are crucial for identifying and studying various pathogens in microbiology. This article outlines common techniques and media used for different microorganisms.

## Sterilization Methods

### Hot Air Oven
The hot air oven is a sterilization method used for oily, greasy, liquidy, and dusty materials [00:07:19].
*   **Temperature and Duration**: 160°C for 2 hours [00:07:31].
*   **Control**: *Bacillus subtilis* [00:06:45].

## Introduction to Respiratory Pathology
The respiratory system is a key area of study in [[Pathology and Microbiology | pathology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Case studies and discussions cover various conditions affecting the lungs and associated structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Lung Conditions and Pathological Features

### Emphysema
Emphysema is a condition characterized by the breaking of lung parenchyma walls, leading to enlarged air spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>. Tiny alveoli gradually become very large airspaces due to the destruction of their walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.

#### Panacinar Emphysema
Panacinar emphysema involves the destruction of all components of the acinus, which includes the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct, and alveolar sac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

> [!INFO] Diagnosis
> The diagnosis of emphysema can be made by observing the enlarged air spaces and broken walls on histopathological examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

#### Case Study: Panacinar Emphysema in a Child
A four-year-old boy experiencing an unknown cause of death showed findings consistent with panacinar emphysema on examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Association
> Panacinar emphysema in a child is typically associated with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. This is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning its onset is in childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

> [!INFO] Genetic Basis
> The gene for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin is located on Chromosome 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Mnemonic for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
> *   **L**ungs: Panacinar emphysema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>
> *   **L**iver: Cirrhosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>
> *   The name "Lal" (meaning red/small child in Hindi) is a mnemonic for this condition, referring to its manifestation in small children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

> [!INFO] Liver Findings in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
> In the liver, characteristic pink colored droplets are formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. These droplets are PAS-positive and diastase-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>.

### Tuberous Sclerosis and Lung Involvement
Tuberous sclerosis, a genetic disorder, can also affect the lungs, leading to a condition called Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. LAM is a tumor-like condition involving lymphatic channels, blood vessels, and smooth muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. These are considered hamartomatous tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Lung Tumors

#### Small Cell Carcinoma
Small cell carcinoma is a type of lung tumor that originates from epithelium but exhibits neuroendocrine differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] Key Features
> *   **Neuroendocrine differentiation:** This means it shares characteristics with neuroendocrine cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.
> *   **IHC Markers:** Positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin, chromogranin, and bombesin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. Also positive for CD56 and CD57 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.
> *   **Paraneoplastic Syndromes:** Small cell carcinoma is famously associated with a maximum number of paraneoplastic syndromes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
> *   **Aggressive Course:** It typically has an aggressive clinical course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.
> *   **MUC1 Negative:** It is not positive for MUC1, which is a marker for adenocarcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.

> [!INFO] Microscopic Features
> *   **Neurosecretory Granules:** Electron microscopy reveals black granules, characteristic neurosecretory granules, which are seen in all neuroendocrine tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.
> *   **Salt and Pepper Chromatin:** The nucleus typically shows a "salt and pepper" chromatin pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.
> *   **Azzopardi Effect:** A distinctive feature is the "blue blood vessel" or Azzopardi effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. This occurs when smudged DNA from broken cancer cells stains the blood vessel walls blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>. The presence of DNA can be confirmed with a Fuelgen stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

#### Adenocarcinoma
Adenocarcinoma is a type of carcinoma for which MUC1 is a marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.

### Tuberculosis (TB)
Tuberculosis is a common respiratory infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] Histopathological Features
> *   **Granuloma with Lymphocytic Collar:** TB granulomas typically show a prominent lymphocytic collar, appearing as a "blue collar" of cells surrounding the granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. This distinguishes it from sarcoidosis granulomas which are "naked" (lacking the collar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
> *   **Caseating Granuloma:** While both caseating and non-caseating granulomas can be seen in TB, caseating granulomas (with necrotic, cheesy centers) are much more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.

> [!INFO] Occupational Predisposition to TB
> Silicosis, an occupational lung disease caused by inhaling silica crystals (common in glass industries), significantly increases the risk of developing TB and lung cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>.

### Occupational Lung Diseases

#### Silicosis
Silicosis results from the inhalation of silica crystals, primarily in industries like glass manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. It leads to an increased risk of TB and lung cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Radiological Finding
> In silicosis, "egg shell calcifications" can be seen on radiology, indicating calcium deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.

#### Asbestosis
Asbestosis is caused by inhaling asbestos fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.

> [!INFO] Pathological Feature: Asbestos Bodies / Ferruginous Bodies
> *   Asbestos fibers, when inhaled, appear as brown, dumbbell-like structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.
> *   The body deposits iron around these inhaled fibers, forming a "ferruginous body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.
> *   Ferruginous bodies stain blue with iron special stains like Perl's or Prussian blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.
> *   **Important Concept:** While all asbestos bodies are ferruginous bodies (because asbestos fibers cause iron deposition), not all ferruginous bodies are asbestos bodies. Ferruginous bodies can also form around other inhaled particles like silica or coal particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.

### Sarcoidosis
[[Pathological features of various diseases | Sarcoidosis]] is a diagnosis of exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>.

> [!INFO] Key Features
> *   **Granuloma without Lymphocytic Collar ("Naked Granuloma"):** Sarcoidosis granulomas lack the prominent lymphocytic collar seen in TB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.
> *   **Elevated Markers:** Diagnosis often involves elevated calcium levels, increased angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, and an increased CD4/CD8 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
> *   **Bodies:**
    *   **Asteroid Body:** A star-shaped inclusion seen within cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Asteroid bodies can also be seen extracellularly in sporothrix infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.
    *   **Schaumann Body:** A round, laminated calcified body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. These are essentially calcium "soma bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

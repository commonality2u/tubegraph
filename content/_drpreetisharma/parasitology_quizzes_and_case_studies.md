## Parasitology Case Studies

### Case 1: Bloody Loose Stools and Ciliated Protozoa

A 32-year-old male presents with bloody loose stools, fever, and abdominal pain for three days after a trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Stool examination reveals a ciliated protozoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

*   **Organism:** *Balantidium coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   **Morphology:** It is a ciliated protozoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, the largest protozoa in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Case 2: Differentiating Entamoeba histolytica from Entamoeba coli

A 22-year-old male presents with stomach discomfort, vomiting, and three days of diarrhea, with a fever of 101Â°F <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. A stool sample is taken to differentiate *Entamoeba histolytica* from *Entamoeba coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

*   **Key Differentiators:**
    *   **Motility/Pseudopodia:** *Entamoeba histolytica* shows rapid, unidirectional, finger-shaped pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, while *Entamoeba coli* has blunt, sluggish, multidirectional pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
    *   **Nucleus (Karyosome):** *Entamoeba histolytica* has a central karyosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, *Entamoeba coli* has an eccentric karyosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
    *   **Erythrophagocytosis:** *Entamoeba histolytica* exhibits erythrophagocytosis (ingestion of RBCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>; *Entamoeba coli* does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
    *   **Chromatoid Bodies:** *Entamoeba histolytica* has thick, cigar-shaped chromatoid bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>; *Entamoeba coli* has thin, splinter-shaped chromatoid bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
        *   Chromatoid bodies are made of ribonucleoproteins (RNP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a> and stain with Iron Hematoxylin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
    *   **Cyst Nuclei Count:** *Entamoeba histolytica* cysts have 1-4 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, while *Entamoeba coli* cysts can have 1-8 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This is generally not a good distinguishing feature in practical scenarios due to overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** *Entamoeba histolytica* causes flask-shaped ulcers in the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a> and "anchovy sauce" appearance in liver abscesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. *Entamoeba coli* is often a normal gut inhabitant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

        *   *Acanthamoeba* trophozoites have "spikes" (acanthopodia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>, and its cysts are wrinkled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
        *   *Balamuthia mandrillaris* trophozoites are fish-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>, and its cysts are smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.
    *   **Associated Conditions:** *Acanthamoeba* also causes keratitis/corneal ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>; *Balamuthia* does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

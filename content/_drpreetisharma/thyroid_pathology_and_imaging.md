Thyroid pathology involves the study and diagnosis of diseases affecting the thyroid gland, often utilizing [[medical_imaging_in_pathology_and_microbiology | imaging]] and biopsy techniques to identify characteristic features and genetic alterations.

## Diagnostic Techniques and [[key_pathology_images_and_their_significance | Key Pathology Images]]

### Non-Toxic Goiter
A 52-year-old woman presenting with a large, symmetrically enlarged thyroid, anterior neck swelling, and discomfort during swallowing, without symptoms of hyper- or hypothyroidism, is likely a case of non-toxic goiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The thyroid profile in such cases is typically normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Thyroid FNAC Adequacy
For a thyroid Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) to be considered adequate, it must follow the "Rule of 6-10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>:
*   Minimum of six follicles should be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   Each follicle should contain at least 10 cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

There are exceptions to this rule where a pathologist may still provide a report despite not meeting the criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>:
1.  **Malignancy:** If malignant cells are observed, a report is given even if the cell count is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
2.  **Colloid Goiter:** In cases of colloid goiter, predominantly fluid and colloid will be aspirated, with few cells, making repeat procedures unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
3.  **Inflammation:** Conditions like Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, characterized by inflammation and destruction of thyroid cells, will show abundant inflammatory cells rather than intact follicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

This system for reporting thyroid FNAC is known as the Bethesda system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid (PCT)
PCT is a common thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Features (Biopsy):**
    *   **Psammoma bodies:** Random blue, rounded calcifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   **Orphan Annie Eye nuclei:** White, clear nuclei due to formalin fixation artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This is also referred to as "optically clear nucleus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Orphan Annie Eye nuclei are seen on biopsy but **not** on FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
    *   **Intranuclear inclusions:** Pink intracytoplasmic inclusions within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
    *   **Intranuclear grooves / Coffee Bean appearance:** Linear invaginations of the nuclear membrane, resembling a coffee bean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
    *   **True papillae:** Finger-like projections with a fibrovascular core (blood vessels and connective tissue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

*   **Microscopic Features (FNAC):**
    *   **Chewing gum colloid:** Stretched, thick colloid material due to aspiration with a thin needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

*   **Genetics:**
    *   Most common genetic alteration is **BRAF V600E mutation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
    *   Second most common is **RET/PTC fusion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Prognosis:** Excellent, with 100% survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Associations:** Can occur due to radiation exposure or following Hashimoto's thyroiditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common thyroid cancer associated with radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

### Follicular Carcinoma
*   **Genetics:** Most common is RAS mutation, followed by PTEN, PI3K, and PAX8-PPARγ mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

### Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC)
*   **Origin:** Arises from parafollicular C cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Tumor Marker:** Calcitonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Features:** Shows amyloid deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, which stain positive with Congo red and show apple-green birefringence under polarized light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
*   **Genetics:** Associated with RET gene mutation (mnemonic: RET 10 MEN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>, often seen in Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes (MEN 2A, 2B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
    *   Note: RET mutation (gain of function) leads to MTC, whereas RET/PTC fusion leads to Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Loss of function of RET gene is associated with Hirschsprung's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

### Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer
*   **Prognosis:** Worst prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

## [[Pathological conditions and diagnostic techniques | Autoimmune Thyroid Conditions]]

### Graves' Disease
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Symptoms of hyperthyroidism (nervousness, muscle weakness, heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss, dyspnea, palpitations, menstrual irregularities, warm moist skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Autoimmune disorder characterized by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI, formerly LATS - Long-Acting Thyroid Stimulators) that bind to and stimulate TSH receptors, leading to excessive thyroid hormone production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
*   **Hypersensitivity:** Belongs to Type 2 (cytotoxic) hypersensitivity reaction, though some sources classify it as Type 5 hypersensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
*   **Gross Appearance:** Beefy red thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Features (Biopsy):**
    *   **Follicular hyperplasia:** Increased number of follicular cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.
    *   **Scalloping of colloid:** The colloid appears "scooped out" or wavy due to increased reabsorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
    *   **Pseudo papillae:** Papillary-like structures without a true fibrovascular core, formed due to exuberant hyperplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.

### Hashimoto's Thyroiditis
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Hypothyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Features (Biopsy):**
    *   **Diffuse enlargement:** Symmetrically enlarged thyroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
    *   **Dense lymphoid infiltrate with germinal centers:** Characteristic blue-colored lymphoid aggregates with lighter central germinal centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.
    *   **Hürthle cells (Askanazy cells):** Large, eosinophilic (pink) cells with abundant granular cytoplasm, representing metaplastic follicular cells in response to damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### Riedel's Thyroiditis
*   Characterized by extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland, making it very hard on palpation and mimicking cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. Not related to Graves' disease.

## Central Stellate Scar (General Pathology)
A central stellate scar, seen as a non-enhancing area on a CT scan, can be observed on gross pathology specimens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This feature is not exclusive to the thyroid but can be seen in various organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>:
*   **Kidney:** Oncocytoma and chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Liver:** Focal Nodular Hyperplasia and Fibrolamellar HCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Pancreas:** Serous cystadenocarcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Breast:** Radial scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

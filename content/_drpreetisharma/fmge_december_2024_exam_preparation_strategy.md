Dr. Preeti Sharma outlines a comprehensive [[exam_preparation_strategy_for_fmge | plan and strategy]] for the upcoming [[FMGE December 2024 Exam Preparation Strategy | December 2024 FMGE exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This strategy is applicable for all students, whether it's their first attempt or if they scored below 150 in the June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Overall Strategy and Timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

The initial focus is on a 60-day timetable, running from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Following this, a detailed revision plan will be introduced, comprising three phases:
*   Revision 1: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Revision 2: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Revision 3: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

This brings the preparation roughly up to December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Key Aspects of the Study Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

The 60-day timetable emphasizes both theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

*   **MCQ Practice:** Aim for 100-120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If not already practicing this many, gradually increase the number (e.g., by 15-20 per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Daily Study Hours:** Target 8-10 hours per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This average is necessary to finish the syllabus and allow for multiple revisions, which are crucial for cracking the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Source Selection:** Utilize a single source per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Students should identify which faculty or notes they understand best and stick to that single source for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Video Resources:**
    *   For subjects where a Q bank score is above 80%, refer to Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   For weaker subjects or topics (Q bank score less than 80%), use main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   For Pathology and Microbiology, directly use Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Subject-wise Study Plan (60 Days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>

Subjects are divided into four blocks for integrated study, adapting to the current exam pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Block 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

### Block 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   **Pathology:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> (Rapid Revision: 19 hours, approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day at 1x speed, or faster at 2x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
*   **Microbiology:** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> (Rapid Revision: 16 hours, approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day at 1x speed, or 1.5x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
*   **Pharmacology:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
*   **Medicine:** 6 days (stronger hold after basic sciences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   **Pediatrics:** 2 days (overlaps with medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   **Physiology:** 1 day (focus on extra physiologies, possibly from RR or LRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
*   **Dermatology (Derma):** 1 day (correlates with Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

### Block 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>

*   **Psychiatry:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>

## Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>

The 58-day study plan includes two dedicated days for Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. A GT day involves both giving the test and reviewing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   **GT 1:** September 8th (even if only 15 out of 19 subjects are finished) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>
*   **GT 2:** September 21st (marks the end of the 60-day timetable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

## [[Daily study schedule for FMGE | Daily Study Schedule for FMGE]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>

To achieve 10 hours of study per day, effective time-boxing is essential, dividing time into study, break, and chill sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

> [!tip] Recommended Daily Plan
> *   **Morning Routine (e.g., 7:00-8:00 AM):** Take one hour to enjoy your morning routine, including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
> *   **Study Session 1 (8:00-11:00 AM):** 3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Practice sitting for 3 hours straight, similar to exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
> *   **Break (11:00-11:30 AM):** 30 minutes. Relax, close eyes, listen to music, talk with family/friends. Avoid social media/screens to prevent eye strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
> *   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM):** 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
> *   **Mega Break (2:00-3:30 PM):** 1.5 hours. Lunch (30 mins) and relaxation, including a power nap or social media/watching something of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
> *   **Study Session 3 (3:30-6:00 PM):** 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
> *   **Break (6:00-7:00 PM):** 1 hour. Mix of physical activity (20 mins) and talking to friends, discussing studies, or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
> *   **Study Session 4 (7:00-9:00 PM):** 2 hours (last study session, time decreases as the day progresses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
> *   **Evening MCQ Practice (9:00 PM onwards):** Create a custom module of 30 mixed questions from subjects already completed that day. This casual test helps stay in touch with past subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
> *   **Wind Down & Sleep (until 11:00/11:30 PM):** Chill, watch social media, watch a web series (e.g., 20 mins daily). Aim for 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

This schedule is for early birds; night owls can adjust timings accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## Mindset and Motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>

It's crucial to focus on the present 60-day plan without dwelling on past hardships or future anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The journey will be tough, "like passing a kidney stone," but remember that nothing remains constant; tough times will pass, and better days will come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. This testing time is meant to build resilience and humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Ultimately, clinical skills and humility are more important than the number of attempts it took to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

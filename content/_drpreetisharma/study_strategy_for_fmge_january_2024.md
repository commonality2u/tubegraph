The [[fmge_december_2024_exam_preparation | FMGE]] examination is scheduled for January 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:36">[02:04:36]</a>. Students have approximately two months plus an additional week to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:32">[02:08:32]</a>. This article outlines a comprehensive [[fmge_exam_preparation strategies | study strategy]] for the upcoming [[fmge_december_2024_exam_preparation | FMGE]] exam, emphasizing effective time management and subject revision.

## Key Principles of Preparation

### Daily Study Hours
Students should aim to study at least 10 to 12 effective hours per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This means if one sits for 12 hours, the output should be for 10 effective hours, accounting for time waste due to anxiety, panic, or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Integrating MCQs with Theory
It is crucial to practice MCQs alongside theory every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Waiting to finish theory before attempting MCQs is not advisable given the limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. While 100+ MCQs per day is ideal, students can start with 50 and gradually increase by 5-7 questions daily to reach the 100-mark within a week and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.

### Utilizing Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision (RR)
With only two months remaining, focus should be on rapid revision (RR) videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Main videos should only be used to clarify concepts that are not clear from RR, playing them for short durations (e.g., 10 minutes) to resolve doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Changing study sources at this stage is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>.

### Source of Questions
Students should use a Q-bank from their preferred platform if they already have a subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Additionally, [[fmge_exam_preparation tips | previous year topics]], rather than rote questions, should be covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This can be done through an app or by referring to [[fmge_december_2024_exam_preparation | FMG solutions]] (textbook format) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. PYTs should be studied from notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Importance of PYQs
Do not mug up previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Instead, identify frequently asked topics from PYQs (e.g., apoptosis appearing 10 times) and study those topics thoroughly from notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Study Timetable (November 13 - January 19)
This [[60day_study_timetable_for_fmge | timetable]] offers no breathing space and requires immediate commencement of studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. The suggested number of days for each subject can be customized based on individual preferences and prior preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

*   **Anatomy:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>
*   **Orthopedics:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>
*   **Biochemistry:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>
*   **Pathology:** 3 days (Nov 20, 21, 22) - utilize rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. This strategically places pathology before PrepLadder's LRR session on Nov 23-24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Psychiatry:** 1 day (can be done during LRR session) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>
*   **ENT:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>
*   **Dermatology:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>
*   **PSM (Community Medicine):** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Focus on main topics, as some questions will be "bouncers" regardless of study duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.
*   **Anesthesia:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>
*   **Microbiology:** 3 days (Dec 2, 3, 4) - utilize rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. Aligned with PrepLadder's LRR session on Dec 3-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   **Surgery:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>
*   **Radiology:** Smaller subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>
*   **OBGYN:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>
*   **Ophthalmology:** 2 days (due to neuro-ophthalmology and squint being tough) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>
*   **Pharmacology:** 3 days (kept towards the end as it's volatile) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>
*   **Pediatrics:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>
*   **Forensic Medicine:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>
*   **Physiology:** Last 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>

This schedule accounts for 18 subjects.

### Medicine Strategy
Medicine should be treated as an ongoing journey rather than a subject to be completed in a fixed number of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   Start studying Medicine from November 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
*   Allocate 1 to 1.5 hours per day for Medicine, consistently until January 19th (the day before the exam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   Fix a specific time for Medicine daily (e.g., 10 AM to 11 AM) and adhere to it with discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
*   By the time medicine is started, 40-50% of its topics would have been covered through pathology, making the process easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>.
*   Utilize rapid revision notes and videos for Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>.

## Revision Strategy for FMGE

The plan includes three rounds of revision:

### Round 1: First Pass (Completion by December 24th)
*   The timetable provided covers this first pass of all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.
*   Pathology and Microbiology are integrated with LRR sessions (Nov 23-24 for Pathology, Dec 3-4 for Microbiology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.
*   After December 24th, dedicated daily targets for Pathology and Microbiology will be provided, focusing on high-yield topics (30-40 minutes daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

### Round 2: Second Pass (December 25th - January 13th)
*   This round focuses on quicker revision of subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.
*   **Short Subjects (Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, Dermatology):** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>
*   **ENT & Ophthalmology:** 2.5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>
*   **Grand Test (GT):** 0.5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>
*   **PSM:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>
*   **OBGYN:** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>
*   **Surgery:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>
*   **Physiology & Pediatrics:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a> (use quick notes, RR, LRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects (Biochemistry, Anatomy, Pharmacology):** 2 days each, placed closer to the exam for better retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.

### Round 3: Final Week (January 14th - January 19th)
*   The last 6-7 days are dedicated to solving previous year questions and revisiting volatile topics that posed difficulties during LRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

## Grand Test (GT) Strategy
*   **Minimum GTs:** Give at least 5 Grand Tests before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** GTs are primarily for time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>. They train the mind to maintain focus and pace (45-50 seconds per question) for the entire duration of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Correct Questions:** Do not read explanations for correct answers in the GT. Instead, review the relevant concept from your own notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Incorrect Questions:** Read explanations for incorrect answers from the Q-bank or solution provided by the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>.
*   **Score Focus:** Do not get disheartened by GT scores. The goal is not to cross 150+ marks in GTs but to learn time management and identify weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>. Platform GTs are often tougher than the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>. A 150+ in GTs might translate to 170-180+ in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>.
*   **Last 15 Days:** Avoid giving GTs in the last 15 days to prevent unnecessary anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>. However, continue solving questions.

## Addressing Common Concerns & Mindset

### Forgetting Information
Forgetting is a natural human tendency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. Accept that information will not stay in your mind forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>. The process involves reading, forgetting, and rereading in a continuous cycle until the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Make peace with this fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>.

### Making Notes and Revisions
To facilitate quick revision, highlight only the most important 5 words per page in your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. This ensures that on the last day, only highlighted words need to be reviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>.

### Positivity and Self-Belief
*   **Control what you can:** Focus on your preparation and effort (200% dedication), as exam patterns or postponements are beyond your control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:03:00">[38:03:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid negativity:** Steer clear of negative discussions or rumors about the exam's difficulty or pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>. Such negativity can be a "black hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>.
*   **Inner motivation:** Motivation from others is short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>. Your dedication should stem from your desire to change your life after January 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13:00">[40:13:00]</a>.
*   **Believe in yourself:** Recognize your past achievements (clearing MBBS entrance, etc.) and stop doubting your capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:26:00">[57:26:00]</a>. Many struggle for years to reach where you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:23:00">[58:23:00]</a>.
*   **Start from zero:** If feeling overwhelmed, assume you are starting from zero today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:59:00">[40:59:00]</a>. It is possible to reach 150 marks by studying diligently in the last 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:14:00">[41:14:00]</a>.
*   **Visualize success:** Keep your dream for after January 20th in mind, whether it's giving an interview about passing the exam or a trip with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:12:00">[59:12:00]</a>.

### Sleep
Aim for 6 hours of sleep for proper mental functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>. Some may prefer 7 hours, but the key is to ensure focus and avoid mental exhaustion upon waking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>.

### Physical and Mental Health
Dedicate 30-40 minutes daily for physical activity, such as a walk, which also helps with mental relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>. Practice deep breathing, ensure a balanced diet, and consider 10-15 minutes of meditation or yoga to keep your heart rate normal and manage anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>.

This [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | strategy]] is designed to be all-inclusive, suitable for both first-timers and those on subsequent attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51:00">[48:51:00]</a>. Students already following another ongoing [[time_table_for_neet_pg_exam_preparation | timetable]] should stick to it but can integrate good points from this plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:00]</a>.

**Note:** A cleaner version of the timetable will be shared on Telegram for easy reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>.

Granulomatous lymphadenitis refers to inflammation of the lymph nodes characterized by the formation of [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granulomas]]. The diagnostic process often involves Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) and biopsy, with specific cellular and architectural features indicating the condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Case Presentation
A common presentation for this condition is a neck swelling, which can be evaluated through FNAC followed by a biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Diagnostic Findings
### Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)
Key findings on FNAC include:
*   **Multi-nucleated [[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | Giant Cells]]**: These are very characteristic, appearing as large cells with multiple nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **[[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | Epithelioid Cells]]**: Identified by their elongated or "slipper-shaped" nuclei, which are distinct from simple round nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The presence of both [[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | multi-nucleated giant cells]] and [[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | epithelioid cells]] on FNAC strongly suggests a [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granuloma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Biopsy
Biopsy findings generally corroborate those seen in FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:
*   **[[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | Giant Cells]]**: Large cells with numerous nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **[[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | Epithelioid Cells]]**: Characterized by elongated, slipper-shaped nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Lymphocytic Collar**: A peripheral ring of small, blue-colored lymphocytes surrounding the core of the [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granuloma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

These three components—[[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | giant cells]], [[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | epithelioid cells]], and a lymphocytic collar—constitute a [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granuloma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. It is possible to identify a [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granuloma]] even without a [[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | giant cell]], as long as [[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | epithelioid cells]] surrounded by a lymphocytic collar are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Tuberculosis Granuloma
If the [[giant_cells_and_granulomas | granuloma]] is due to tuberculosis, additional features may be observed:
*   **Caseous Necrosis (Gross)**: On gross examination of a lymph node, tuberculosis can manifest as a "cheesy" appearance within the cut surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Caseous Necrosis (FNAC)**: FNAC from caseous necrosis appears pink and granular, homogeneous, and somewhat dirty, indicative of cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Conclusion
The combined findings of [[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | giant cells]], [[identifying_multinucleated_giant_cells_and_epithelioid_cells | epithelioid cells]], and a lymphocytic collar on FNAC and biopsy are diagnostic of granulomatous lymphadenitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

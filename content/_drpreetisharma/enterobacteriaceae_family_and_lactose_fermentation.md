The Enterobacteriaceae family consists of [[gram_negative_bacilli | Gram negative bacilli]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>. All members of this family are generally motile, with two exceptions: *Shigella* and *Klebsiella*, which are immotile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>. All Enterobacteriaceae are catalase positive and oxidase negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>, except for *Shigella dysenteriae* type 1, which is catalase negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.

## Lactose Fermentation Classification
The Enterobacteriaceae family is classified based on its ability to ferment lactose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>:

*   **Lactose Fermenters (LF)**: Organisms that ferment lactose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.
*   **Non-Lactose Fermenters (NLF)**: Organisms that do not ferment lactose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
*   **Late Lactose Fermenters (LLF)**: Organisms that ferment lactose slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.

The primary lactose fermenters in this family are *E. coli* and *Klebsiella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. All other members, such as *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, and *Proteus*, are typically non-lactose fermenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. A notable exception is *Shigella sonnei*, which is a late lactose fermenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

## Identifying Bacteria Using Culture Media
[[identifying_bacteria_using_culture_media | Lactose fermentation]] is identified using specific culture media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>:

### MacConkey Agar
*   **Composition**: Contains peptone, agar, lactose, neutral red, and taurocholate (bile salts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.
*   **Indicator**: Neutral red is the color indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.
*   **Lactose Fermentation**: Lactose fermenters produce a pink color on MacConkey agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.
*   **Inhibitory Nature**: MacConkey agar is inhibitory to gram-positive organisms, primarily allowing gram-negative organisms to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.

### CLED Medium
*   **Indicator**: Bromothymol blue is the color indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.
*   **Lactose Fermentation**: Lactose fermenters produce a yellow color on CLED medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

### CLED vs. MacConkey: Which is Better?
CLED medium is considered better than MacConkey agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a> because it is less inhibitory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a> and allows both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms (like *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Candida*) to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. MacConkey agar focuses primarily on gram-negative organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. Both media differentiate lactose fermenters from non-lactose fermenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

## Characteristics of Specific Bacterial Cultures
[[characteristics_of_specific_bacterial_cultures | Specific characteristics]] within the Enterobacteriaceae family:

### *E. coli*
*   *E. coli* is a lactose fermenter, producing a pink color on MacConkey agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.
*   It does not have a capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.
*   Two main conditions caused by *E. coli* are urinary tract infections (UTI) and [[diarrhea_causing_strains_of_e_coli | diarrhea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.
    *   For UTI diagnosis, a clean-catch, early morning, midstream urine sample is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.
    *   The criteria for UTI diagnosis is typically more than 10^5 colony forming units (CFU) per ml of bacteria, known as the Kass criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
    *   Exceptions to the Kass criteria where a count less than 10^5 is significant include suprapubic aspiration, presence of gram-positive organisms (which are not normal commensals of the urinary tract), or when the patient is on antibiotics or diuretics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.

### *Klebsiella*
*   *Klebsiella* is a lactose fermenter, producing a pink color on MacConkey agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   It is a capsulated organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.
*   Due to its capsule, it produces shiny, mucoid, and stringy colonies on culture media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>. This mucoid appearance can be seen in cases like pyogenic liver abscesses caused by *Klebsiella pneumoniae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.

### *Proteus*
*   *Proteus* is a non-lactose fermenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
*   It is known for its positive PPA (Phenylpyruvic Acid) test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>.
*   It is urease positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.
*   *Proteus* exhibits a characteristic swarming motility on agar plates, appearing as concentric rings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>. Other organisms that show swarming motility include *Vibrio parahaemolyticus*, *Clostridium tetani*, and *Serratia* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.
*   **Dienes Phenomenon**: This phenomenon is observed in *Proteus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>. When different strains of *Proteus* are grown on a blood agar plate, they will maintain a line of demarcation between them, indicating they are distinct strains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:39">[01:24:39]</a>. If they are the same strain, they will fuse and swarm together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:11">[01:24:11]</a>.
*   *Proteus* can produce a fishy odor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09">[01:26:09]</a>.

### *Shigella*
*   Most *Shigella* species are non-lactose fermenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
*   *Shigella sonnei* is an exception, being a late lactose fermenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.
*   *Shigella* is immotile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
*   *Shigella dysenteriae* type 1 is catalase negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.

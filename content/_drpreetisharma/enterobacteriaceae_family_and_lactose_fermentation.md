The [[Enterobacteriaceae family and lactose fermentation | Enterobacteriaceae family]] consists of [[gram_negative_bacilli | Gram negative bacilli]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This family is characterized by general rules regarding motility, catalase, and oxidase reactions, as well as their ability to ferment lactose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.

## General Characteristics
All members of the [[Enterobacteriaceae family and lactose fermentation | Enterobacteriaceae family]] are generally motile, except for _Shigella_ and _Klebsiella_, which are non-motile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. They are all catalase positive and oxidase negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>, with the exception of _Shigella dysenteriae_ type 1, which is catalase negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.

## Lactose Fermentation
The [[Enterobacteriaceae family and lactose fermentation | Enterobacteriaceae family]] is classified based on their ability to ferment lactose:
*   **Lactose Fermenters (LF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>
*   **Non-Lactose Fermenters (NLF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>
*   **Late Lactose Fermenters (LLF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>

[[Bacterial fermentation processes | Bacterial fermentation processes]] of lactose is a key factor in their [[identification_of_specific_bacterial_species | identification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

### Lactose Fermenters
The primary lactose fermenters in this family are _E. coli_ and _Klebsiella_ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.

### Non-Lactose Fermenters
All other members of the family, such as _Salmonella_, _Shigella_ (excluding _Shigella sonnei_), _Proteus_, and _Yersinia_, are non-lactose fermenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

### Late Lactose Fermenters
_Shigella sonnei_ is a late lactose fermenter, meaning it ferments lactose slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

### Culture Media for Lactose Fermentation
Two common media are used for [[culture_media_preparation_and_identification | identifying lactose fermentation]]:
*   **MacConkey Agar**: Lactose fermenters produce pink colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>. The indicator used in MacConkey agar is neutral red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>. MacConkey agar contains peptone, lactose, agar, neutral red, and taurocholate (bile salts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.
*   **CLED Media (Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient)**: Lactose fermenters produce yellow colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>. The indicator used in CLED media is bromothymol blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.

### MacConkey vs. CLED
CLED medium is considered superior to MacConkey agar, especially for diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.
*   **MacConkey Agar** primarily supports the growth of [[gram_negative_bacilli | gram negative organisms]] and is inhibitory to [[gram_positive_bacilli | gram positive organisms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.
*   **CLED Medium** is less inhibitory and allows the growth of both [[gram_negative_bacilli | gram negative]] and [[gram_positive_bacilli | gram positive organisms]] (e.g., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Candida_) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.

## Specific Members of Enterobacteriaceae

### _Escherichia coli_ (_E. coli_)
_E. coli_ is a lactose fermenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. It commonly causes urinary tract infections (UTIs) and diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.

#### Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)
*   **Sample Collection**: For UTI diagnosis, a clean catch, early morning, midstream urine sample is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Kass Criteria**: A diagnosis of UTI is given when bacterial counts exceed 10^5 colony forming units (CFU) per ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This high cutoff accounts for commensal bacteria normally present in the urinary tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.
*   **Exceptions to Kass Criteria (SPA)**: A count less than 10^5 CFU/ml can still be significant in cases of:
    *   **S**uprapubic Aspiration (SPA): Directly collected bladder urine is sterile, so any count is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
    *   **P**ositive [[gram_positive_bacilli | Gram positive organisms]] (e.g., _Staphylococcus_, _Candida_): These are not typical commensals of the urinary tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.
    *   **A**ntibiotic/Diuretic Therapy: Prior antibiotic use reduces bacterial load, and diuretics dilute urine, affecting counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.

#### [[pathogenesis_and_identification_of_e_coli_strains | Diarrhea Strains of _E. coli_]]
Different strains of _E. coli_ cause specific types of diarrhea:
*   **Enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC)**: Causes infantile diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>.
*   **Enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)**: Causes traveler's diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.
*   **Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC)**: Invades cells, causing bloody stools (dysentery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)**: Causes hemorrhagic colitis and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>. The specific strain associated with HUS is O157:H7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. HUS is characterized by a triad of renal insufficiency, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.
*   **Enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC)**: Causes persistent diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>. It shows a "stacked brick" appearance on Hep-2 cell lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>.

### _Klebsiella_
_Klebsiella_ is a lactose fermenter and produces pink, shiny, mucoid colonies on MacConkey agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The mucoid appearance is due to its capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ can cause pyogenic liver abscesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.

### _Proteus_
_Proteus_ is a non-lactose fermenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>. Key characteristics include:
*   **PPA Test (Phenylpyruvic Acid Test)**: Positive for _Proteus_ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.
*   **Dienes Phenomenon**: This is a test that differentiates _Proteus_ strains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>. If two different _Proteus_ strains are inoculated on a blood agar, they will swarm but stop at a line of demarcation, indicating they are different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>. If they are the same strain, they will fuse together without a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:11">[01:24:11]</a>.
*   **Urease Positive**: _Proteus_ produces urease enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.
*   **Swarming Motility**: _Proteus_ exhibits characteristic swarming motility on agar, appearing as concentric circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>. Other organisms showing swarming motility include _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, _[[characteristics_and_lab_diagnosis_of_clostridium_species | Clostridium tetani]]_, and _Serratia_ (PVCS mnemonic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.
*   **Fishy Odor**: _Proteus_ produces a distinctive fishy odor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09">[01:26:09]</a>.

## Introduction
This article covers key aspects of systemic pathology, focusing on common conditions and diagnostic techniques in thyroid and breast pathology, as well as an introduction to bacteriology. It also touches upon study strategies for these subjects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

## Systemic Pathology
Systemic pathology encompasses the study of diseases affecting specific organ systems.

### Thyroid Pathology
The thyroid gland is a common site for various [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | pathological conditions]].

#### Stellate Scar
A stellate scar, which appears as a non-enhancing central area, can be seen in several organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>:
*   **Kidney**: [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | Oncocytoma]] and chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>
*   **Liver**: Focal nodular hyperplasia and fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
*   **Pancreas**: Serous cystadenocarcinoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   **Breast**: Radial scar. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

#### Non-Toxic Goiter
This condition is characterized by a symmetrically enlarged thyroid gland, typically presenting with discomfort during swallowing but without significant symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> The patient's thyroid profile is usually normal (euthyroid). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>

#### Normal Thyroid Histology
Thyroid tissue is composed of follicles lined by follicular epithelial cells, which produce most thyroid cancers (e.g., papillary, follicular, anaplastic). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> Pink colloid material fills the follicles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> Parafollicular C cells, located outside the follicles, secrete calcitonin and are the origin of medullary thyroid cancer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>

#### Thyroid Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)
*   **Adequacy Rule**: For a thyroid FNAC to be considered adequate, there should be a minimum of six follicles, with each follicle containing at least 10 cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>
*   **Exceptions to Adequacy**: A report can still be given even if the 6/10 rule is not met in cases of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>:
    *   Malignancy (e.g., if highly suspicious cells are seen). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
    *   Colloid goiter (as mainly colloid/fluid will be aspirated). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
    *   Inflammation (e.g., [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | Hashimoto's Thyroiditis]]). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>
*   **Bethesda System**: This system is used for classifying thyroid FNAC results. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>

#### Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid (PCT)
*   **Characteristics**:
    *   Presence of papillae (finger-like projections) with a fibrovascular core (true papillae). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
    *   Orphan Annie Eye Nuclei (optically clear nuclei): A false finding or artifact due to formalin fixation, thus seen on biopsy but **not** on FNAC. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>
    *   Psammoma bodies (calcium deposits). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>
    *   Intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (pseudo-inclusions or "inky"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>
    *   Intranuclear grooves or "coffee bean nuclei." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>
*   **FNAC Finding**: "Chewing gum colloid" due to the thick colloid getting stretched during aspiration with a thin needle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>
*   **Genetics**: Most commonly associated with BRAF V600E mutation and RET/PTC fusion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>
*   **Prognosis**: Has an excellent prognosis with nearly 100% survival. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>
*   **Associations**: Most common thyroid cancer associated with radiation exposure and can follow [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | Hashimoto's Thyroiditis]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>

#### Follicular Carcinoma Thyroid
*   **Genetics**: Most commonly associated with RAS mutations, followed by PTEN, PI3K, and PAX8/PPARÎ³ mutations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>

#### Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC)
*   **Origin**: Arises from parafollicular C cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>
*   **Tumor Markers**: Calcitonin and CEA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0="00:21:40>[00:21:40]</a>
*   **Histology**: Characterized by amyloid deposits (pink material), which stain with Congo Red and show apple-green birefringence under polarizing microscopy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>
*   **Genetics**: Associated with RET gene mutation (mnemonic: RET 10 MEN). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a> It is linked to Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, specifically MEN 2A and 2B. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>
*   **RET Gene Distinction**: RET gene mutation alone leads to MTC, while RET/PTC fusion leads to papillary thyroid carcinoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>
*   **RET Gene Loss of Function**: Loss of function of the RET gene is associated with Hirschsprung's disease (due to failure of ganglion cell formation). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>

#### Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer
This type of thyroid cancer has the worst prognosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>

#### Graves' Disease
*   **Symptoms**: Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include nervousness, muscle weakness, heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss, dyspnea, palpitations, menstrual irregularities, and warm, moist skin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>
*   **Antibodies**: Presence of anti-TSH receptor antibodies, also known as Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins (TSI) or Long Acting Thyroid Stimulators (LATS). These antibodies stimulate the thyroid gland. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>
*   **Hypersensitivity**: Belongs to Type II hypersensitivity, though some newer classifications place it under Type V. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>
*   **Biopsy Findings**:
    *   Follicular hyperplasia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>
    *   Scalloping of colloid (colloid appears "eaten" or scooped out due to increased activity). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>
    *   Beefy red appearance of the thyroid gland. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>
    *   Pseudo papillae (projections without a fibrovascular core, unlike true papillae in PCT). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>

#### Hashimoto's Thyroiditis
*   **Characteristics**: Hypothyroidism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>
*   **Biopsy Findings**:
    *   Dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with prominent germinal centers (mimicking a lymph node). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>
    *   Hurthle cells (also known as Askanazy cells): Large, eosinophilic follicular cells that proliferate as a compensatory mechanism against thyroid destruction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>

#### Riedel's Thyroiditis
Characterized by extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland, making it very hard on palpation and mimicking cancer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>

### Breast Pathology
Breast pathology involves a range of conditions, both benign and malignant.

#### HER2/neu Amplification
*   **Detection**: Detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), where a brown stain indicates positive expression (due to DAB chromogen). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>
*   **Scoring**: IHC results are scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>
    *   0 and 1+ are negative. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>
    *   3+ is positive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>
    *   2+ is equivocal, requiring further investigation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>
*   **FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization)**: Performed for 2+ (equivocal) cases. HER2/neu gene is on chromosome 17. An amplified ratio (HER2/CEP17) greater than 2.2 indicates HER2/neu amplification. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>
*   **Other Names**: HER2/neu is also known as HER2 or EGFR2. (Note: EGFR1 is different and mutated in adenocarcinoma lung). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>
*   **Targeted Therapy**: Amplified HER2/neu responds to targeted therapy like Trastuzumab. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>

#### Mucinous Carcinoma Breast (Colloid Carcinoma)
*   **Gross Appearance**: Typically soft and jelly-like. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>
*   **Histology**: Characterized by pools of extracellular mucin with tumor cells floating within them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a> While predominantly extracellular, it can also have some intracellular mucin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>
*   **FNAC Finding**: "Chicken wire blood vessels" (entangled blood vessels due to the thick mucin getting stuck in the needle). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>

#### Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Breast
*   **Histology**: Cells are arranged in a single file pattern, known as "Indian file pattern." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>
*   **Signet Ring Cells**: Can also show signet ring cells, which contain only intracellular mucin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>
*   **Multicentricity and Bilaterality**: Notably, this carcinoma can be bilateral and multicentric, requiring examination of the contralateral breast. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>

#### Inflammatory Carcinoma Breast
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Presents with skin changes such as dimpling and "peau d'orange" (orange peel appearance), mimicking an inflammatory disorder. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>
*   **Pathology**: This appearance is due to dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>

#### Male Breast Cancer
*   **Incidence**: Much less common than in females. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>
*   **Genetics**: Commonly associated with BRCA mutations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>
*   **Most Common Type**: Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common histological type. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>

#### Molecular Classification of Breast Cancer
The molecular classification is based on gene profiling, with IHC (Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), HER2/neu, Ki67) used as a surrogate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>
*   **Triple Negative**: Negative for ER, PR, and HER2/neu. Includes Medullary Carcinoma Breast and Metaplastic Carcinoma Breast. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>
*   **HER2-rich**: Positive for HER2/neu, negative for ER and PR. Includes Apocrine Carcinoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>
*   **Luminal A**: Positive for ER and PR, negative for HER2/neu, and low Ki67 (<14%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>
*   **Luminal B**: Positive for ER and PR, negative for HER2/neu but high Ki67 (>14%) OR positive for ER, PR, and HER2/neu (sometimes referred to as "triple positive"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>
    *   Ki67 (or MIB1) is a proliferation marker. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a> A very high Ki67 (almost 100%) is seen in Burkitt's Lymphoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>
*   **Dustbin Category**: Luminal A and B categories include many common breast cancers like Tubular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma, and Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (low grade). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>

This article provides an [[microbiology_lecture_series_covering_systemic_pathology_and_microbiology | overview of systemic pathology]] and touches upon aspects of [[overview_of_bacteriology | bacteriology]], with a focus on image-based questions and diagnostic criteria from recent exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The session emphasizes active recall and understanding rather than rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

## Pathology Case Studies

### Thyroid Pathology

The discussion began with a review of thyroid pathology, often linked to anterior neck swelling and discomfort during swallowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

#### Stellate Scars
A homework assignment involved identifying conditions that present with a stellate scar, which appears as a non-enhancing area on a CT scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Kidney:** Oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Liver:** Focal nodular hyperplasia and fibrolamellar HCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Pancreas:** Serous cyst adenocarcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Breast:** Radial scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

#### Thyroid FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology)
The adequacy of a thyroid FNAC is determined by the "Rule of 6/10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>:
*   At least six follicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   Each follicle having at least 10 cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

**Exceptions to the 6/10 rule (when a report can still be given despite inadequacy)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>:
*   Presence of malignancy (e.g., papillary carcinoma cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Colloid goiter (primarily fluid/colloid without many cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Inflammation (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

This system for classifying thyroid FNA results is known as the Bethesda system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

#### Thyroid Cancers
*   **Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid**
    *   **Histological Features:**
        *   True papillae with fibrovascular cores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
        *   Orphan Annie eye nuclei (optically clear nucleus), a formalin artifact seen on biopsy but not FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

    *   **Associations:** Radiation exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a> and Hashimoto's thyroiditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

*   **Follicular Carcinoma Thyroid**
    *   **Genetics:** RAS mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a> and mutations in genes like PTEN, PI3K, PAX8/PPARÎ³ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

#### Non-Toxic Goiter

#### Graves' Disease
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Hyperthyroidism symptoms (nervousness, muscle weakness, heat intolerance, weight loss, palpitations, menstrual irregularities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Autoimmune disease caused by Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins (TSI), previously called Long-Acting Thyroid Stimulators (LATS), which bind to and stimulate TSH receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

### Breast Pathology

#### HER2 Amplification in Breast Cancer
HER2 (also known as ERBB2 or Neu) amplification is a genetic mechanism in breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.
*   **Immunohistochemistry (IHC):** Positive HER2 staining (brown color due to DAB chromogen) is scored 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.
*   **FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization):** Performed when IHC score is 2+ (equivocal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. A HER2/CEP17 ratio (HER2 gene signals vs. chromosome 17 centromere signals) greater than 2.2 indicates amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
*   **Targeted Therapy:** Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is used for HER2-amplified cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   **EGFR vs. ERBB2:** EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 1) is often mutated in adenocarcinoma lung, while ERBB2 (HER2) is relevant in breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.

#### Mucinous (Colloid) Carcinoma Breast
*   Often presents as a soft, jelly-like mass, misleading clinically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

*   Predominantly extracellular mucin, but can sometimes have intracellular mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.
*   FNAC shows "chicken wire blood vessels" due to vessels getting stuck in the jelly-like mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

#### Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Breast
*   Typically presents with irregular nodularity and can be bilateral and multicentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

#### Inflammatory Carcinoma Breast
*   Presents with skin changes like dimpling or *peau d'orange* appearance (orange peel-like skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.
*   This is due to dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

#### Male Breast Cancer
*   Much less common than female breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.
*   Most commonly presents as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.
*   Associated with BRCA2 mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.

#### Molecular Classification of Breast Cancer
The molecular classification is based on gene profiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>, although surrogate markers like IHC for ER, PR, and HER2 are commonly used in clinical practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.
*   **Luminal A:** ER/PR positive, HER2 negative, low Ki67 (<14%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. Includes tumors like tubular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, and low-grade invasive lobular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   **Luminal B:** ER/PR positive, HER2 negative or positive, high Ki67 (>14%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>. Includes high-grade invasive lobular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>. Can sometimes be triple positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **HER2-enriched:** HER2 positive, ER/PR negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>. Includes apocrine carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.

## Conclusion and Study Strategy
The session highlighted the importance of a targeted approach to studying pathology, focusing on key images and diagnostic criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This segmented approach helps with retention, especially for subjects like [[overview_of_bacteriology | bacteriology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>. Regular quizzes and live sessions reinforce learning.

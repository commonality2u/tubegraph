[[breast_cancer_pathology_and_genetics | Lobular carcinoma]] is a type of breast cancer characterized by specific histological and [[molecular_classification_in_breast_cancer | molecular features]].

## Clinical Presentation
A 58-year-old woman may present with irregular nodularity in the breast, often palpated by the patient herself [00:10:37]. Mammography can reveal irregular densities in both breasts [00:10:45].

## Histological Features
Diagnosis is confirmed via needle biopsy [00:10:49]. A classical finding in [[breast_cancer_pathology_and_genetics | lobular carcinoma]] is the "Indian file pattern," where tumor cells are arranged one behind the other in a single-file line, similar to disciplined army men [00:10:54]. This pattern can be seen in both invasive lobular carcinoma and its premalignant form, lobular carcinoma in situ [00:11:00].

## Molecular Basis
The occurrence of [[breast_cancer_pathology_and_genetics | lobular carcinoma]] is associated with a down-regulation of the E-cadherin protein [00:11:18]. This protein is encoded by the CDH1 gene, which is found to be defective in this cancer type [00:11:26]. This genetic defect contributes to the characteristic arrangement of cells due to impaired cell-to-cell adhesion.

## Characteristics
[[breast_cancer_pathology_and_genetics | Lobular carcinoma]] can often be bilateral and multicentric [00:11:34], meaning it may appear in both breasts and/or in multiple locations within the same breast. The observation of irregular densities in both breasts on mammography can support this characteristic [00:11:42].

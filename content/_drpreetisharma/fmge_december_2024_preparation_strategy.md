Dr. Preeti Sharma outlines a comprehensive strategy for the upcoming [[FMGE December 2023 exam preparation strategy | FMGE December 2024 exam]], applicable to first-time aspirants as well as those who scored below 150 in the recent June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The strategy focuses on a structured 60-day study plan followed by dedicated revision phases.

## Overall Study Strategy

The core of the strategy is a 60-day timetable, running from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This is followed by a detailed revision plan consisting of three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>:
*   **Revision 1**: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   **Revision 2**: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   **Revision 3**: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

This brings the preparation roughly up to December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The revision plan can be adjusted once the exact exam date is announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Daily Study Recommendations

The daily routine should integrate both theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### MCQs Practice
A target of 100 to 120 MCQs per day is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. If you're new to practicing MCQs, start by gradually increasing your daily count by 15-20 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Study Hours
Aim for an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is crucial to complete the syllabus within the 60-day period and allow for multiple revisions, which are key to cracking the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Study Source
Maintain a single source for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Choose faculty or notes that you understand best, even if it means combining resources from different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Video Lectures: Main vs. Rapid Revision
*   **Rapid Revision**: Use for subjects where you consistently score above 80% in your Q bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Main Videos**: Refer to these for weaker subjects or topics where you score less than 80% in your Q bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Specific Recommendations**: For Pathology and Microbiology, it is explicitly suggested to use rapid revision videos only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For Pathology, 19 hours of rapid revision are needed, and for Microbiology, 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This translates to approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day at 1x speed, though faster speeds like 1.5x or 1.75x (even 2x for pathology) are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Subject Prioritization: 60-Day Plan

Subjects are divided into four integrated blocks to facilitate better understanding and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The given number of days for each subject should be followed, though slight adjustments based on personal strengths and weaknesses are permissible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule (`Timeboxing`)

To achieve the 8-10 hours of study, follow a structured daily routine:

*   **Morning Routine (1 hour)**: Enjoy your morning, ideally with 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)**: 3 hours of focused study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This session length prepares you for the exam duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Short Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM)**: 30 minutes to relax, close eyes, listen to music, talk to family, but avoid social media or other screens to prevent eye strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM)**: 1.5 hours for lunch, power nap, or personal leisure (including social media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Good Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)**: 1 hour for relaxation, talking with friends, or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM)**: 2 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Evening MCQ Session (9:00 PM onwards)**: Create a custom module of 30 mixed-bag questions from subjects already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Do this casually, without writing or bookmarking, to stay in touch with older subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This should take about 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Wind Down (until 11:00/11:30 PM)**: Relax, watch a web series, or engage in personal activities before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

This schedule allows for 10 hours of study with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## Mindset and Motivation

*   **Focus on the Present**: Erase past scores or hardships and avoid future anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Concentrate entirely on the 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Consistency and Vigilance**: Be very consistent and vigilant with the timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Timeboxing**: Practice dividing your time efficiently between study, breaks, and leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **"This Too Shall Pass"**: Embrace the mantra that tough times are not constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. The journey may be painful, but it will lead to better days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   **Humility**: Tough times can make you humble, which is an important trait for a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. In the long run, clinical skills and humility matter more than the number of attempts to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

Start your preparation on July 24th with a positive mindset, having your study table and first subject ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

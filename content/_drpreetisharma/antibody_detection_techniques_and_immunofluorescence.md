Immunofluorescence, also known as [[fluorescent_microscopy_and_staining_techniques | fluorescent microscopy]], is a technique used to identify various antibody patterns and is a common topic in examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

### Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) Patterns
These patterns are observed using [[fluorescent_microscopy_and_staining_techniques | immunofluorescence]] to detect antinuclear antibodies (ANA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

*   **Homogenous Pattern** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>
    *   Characterized by a uniform green staining across the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
    *   Indicates antibodies against almost all nuclear components, such as anti-dsDNA antibodies and anti-histone antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Peripheral Pattern (Rim Pattern)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>
    *   Shows more intense green staining at the periphery of the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
    *   Primarily detects anti-dsDNA antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Nucleolar Pattern** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>
    *   Appears as a single dot or dots within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
    *   Detects antibodies against RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Speckled Pattern** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>
    *   Characterized by numerous small dots or speckles throughout the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
    *   It is the most common and non-specific pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
    *   Can be observed in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Sj√∂gren's syndrome, and other autoimmune diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Centromeric Pattern** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>
    *   Identified by distinct speckled staining corresponding to centromeres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
    *   Detects anti-centromeric antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
    *   Associated with CREST syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

### Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA)
ANCA patterns are detected using [[fluorescent_microscopy_and_staining_techniques | immunofluorescence]] on neutrophil substrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. The key is to locate the nucleus in these photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

*   **C-ANCA (Cytoplasmic ANCA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>
    *   Characterized by diffuse granular staining of the cytoplasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
    *   Also referred to as PR3-ANCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
    *   Most specifically seen in Wegener's granulomatosis (now known as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **P-ANCA (Perinuclear ANCA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>
    *   Shows staining concentrated around the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.
    *   Also referred to as MPO-ANCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.
    *   Seen in microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome, as well as ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
    *   P-ANCA is considered less specific compared to C-ANCA, as it can be positive in multiple conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing C-ANCA and P-ANCA**: The key is to observe where the green fluorescence is concentrated; if it's the entire cytoplasm, it's C-ANCA, if it's around the nucleus forming a boundary, it's P-ANCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

### Other Immunofluorescence Applications

*   **Kidney Amyloidosis**: Amyloid deposits in the kidney, which cause a waxy kidney appearance, are typically stained with Congo Red. When viewed under a polarizing microscope, they show an apple green birefringence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **Lupus Nephritis**: On [[light_and_electron_microscopy_in_microbiology | electron microscopy]], lupus nephritis shows a "thumbprint appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>. Immunofluorescence reveals a "full house effect," meaning IgG, IgA, IgM, C1, C2, and C4 are all positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. Under light microscopy, the classic finding is wire loop lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.
*   **Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN)**: Immunofluorescence in PSGN shows a "starry sky" or "lumpy bumpy" appearance due to subepithelial humps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.
*   **Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)**:
    *   **Type I (Goodpasture Syndrome)**: Immunofluorescence shows a linear pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.
    *   **Type II**: Shows a "lumpy bumpy" or "starry sky" appearance, similar to PSGN, as PSGN can progress to RPGN Type II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.
    *   **Type III**: Does not have a specific [[fluorescent_microscopy_and_staining_techniques | immunofluorescence]] pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

## Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) is a mesenchymal or stromal tumor that can occur in the stomach or intestine [00:10:48]. It typically presents as a firm, smooth, yellowish submucosal mass [00:10:29].

### Clinical Presentation
Patients may complain of upper gastrointestinal (GI) pain and tar stools [00:10:24].

### Pathology
GIST is characterized by biopsy revealing spindle cells, indicating its mesenchymal or stromal nature [00:10:48].

### Cell of Origin
GIST arises from the cells of Cajal, which are known as the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract [00:11:19].

### Genetic Mutations
Mutations in the cells of Cajal lead to GIST formation [00:11:26].
*   **KIT (CD117) Mutation:** This is the most common mutation observed in GIST [00:11:31]. It leads to an increase in tyrosine kinase activity [00:11:40].
*   **PDGF Mutation:** Another mutation that can be seen in GIST [00:12:16].
*   **SDH (Succinate Dehydrogenase) Mutation:** This mutation is particularly associated with pediatric GIST [00:12:19].

### Diagnosis and Markers
*   **Sensitive Marker:** KIT (CD117) [00:12:35].
*   **Specific Marker:** DOG1 (Diagnostic of GIST) [00:12:42].

### Treatment
While surgery is typically performed for tumors, medical treatment for GIST involves a tyrosine kinase inhibitor [00:11:46].
*   **Imatinib:** This drug is used to treat GIST due to its tyrosine kinase inhibiting properties [00:11:58]. Imatinib is also used in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [00:12:04].

Approaching an exam, it is common to experience heightened heart rates and palpitations due to panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This session focuses on the importance of maintaining a positive and confident mindset to navigate the exam day successfully, emphasizing mental preparation and strategic approaches to challenges rather than last-minute academic cramming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Pre-Exam Preparation and Mindset
It is crucial to cease studying by a certain evening hour (e.g., 7-7:30 PM) on the day before the exam to allow for relaxation and a good night's sleep, which is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Before the exam, ensure all necessary items are prepared:
*   **Admit Card:** Ready and checked for any spelling mistakes against your ID proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Do not paste the photograph on the admit card as per email instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Valid ID Proof:** Kept in an easily accessible place to avoid loss on exam morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Exam Centre:** Location should be confirmed beforehand, not left for the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Arrival Time:** Aim to reach the exam centre well in advance of the entry cut-off (e.g., 8:30 AM for Paper 1) to allow time for your heart rate to normalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Between Paper 1 and Paper 2, it is advised not to discuss questions or engage in recall sessions, as hearing about missed or incorrectly answered questions can negatively impact performance on the second paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Instead, focus on light food and drink to maintain energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

For last-minute [[importance_of_revision_and_mcq_practice | revision]], if you have a personal "volatile list," stick to that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Otherwise, scanning images from subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Orthopaedics, and Radiology can be beneficial as they often feature classical spotter images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Shifting from Negativity to Positivity
Students often express feelings of forgetting everything or anxiety about the exam being the "worst day of their life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. To combat this, it is crucial to consciously eliminate negative thoughts from the mind from the present moment until the exam concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Engaging in positive self-talk and [[role_of_faith_and_belief_in_exam_success | belief]] can significantly impact performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>:
*   **Count Blessings:** Acknowledge your hard work and blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Affirmation:** Repeatedly tell yourself the paper will be easy and you will avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Eliminate Self-Doubt:** Trust your preparation and ability, even if you feel you don't remember everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This belief will help normalize your heart rate and prevent silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Lean on Faith:** Cling to whatever gives you faith—God, the universe, parental blessings, or a personal superstition—as this provides security and prevents attracting negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## During the Exam - Strategies for a Positive Mindset
The exam may consist of two papers, with one potentially being easier and the other more difficult, balancing the overall challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Do not let a tough first paper discourage you, as the second paper might be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Approach to Questions
*   **"Switch On/Switch Off" Mode:** When attempting questions, focus solely on the current question. Once done, "switch off" from it and move immediately to the next, avoiding dwelling on past questions or future ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This means dedicating approximately 50 seconds per question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Dealing with "Bouncers":** Expect 10-20 "bouncers" (exceptionally tough questions) in each paper that even experts might find challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These are designed to maintain the exam's screening level and are not meant for everyone to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Do not let these questions demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If you encounter such a question, smile, mark an option (A, B, C, or D), trust divine intervention for a lucky guess, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Avoiding [[managing_exam_anxiety_and_stress | Silly Mistakes]]:** The biggest mistake is to focus on tough questions and then make silly errors on easy ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. These are common human errors, but they should not be amplified by panic and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut Feeling:** Your first instinct is often correct because you are not burdened by pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Avoid overthinking and changing answers at the last minute, as this often leads to errors caused by panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   **Read Carefully:** Even if a question seems familiar, spend the necessary time (e.g., 20 seconds) to read the entire question and all options to avoid missing a twist or nuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Time Management:** Some questions will be quick one-liners, while others will be lengthy. Don't worry if a lengthy question takes more than the average 50 seconds; the balance will be covered by quicker questions like image-based diagnoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. It is normal for the first 10-15 minutes to be slower as you settle in and your heart rate normalizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>; pick up the pace afterwards.

### Maintaining Confidence
From the moment you wake up on exam day until you sit at the computer screen, maintain an "overconfident" mindset, believing your preparation, strategy, and teachers were the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. This confidence helps you reach the exam hall. Once seated, adopt a sane and practical mindset, reading every question and option carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. If an answer isn't immediately clear, systematically rule out options to arrive at the correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Post-Exam Perspective
Remember that no one is there to judge you. Your true supporters (teachers, parents, friends) understand your hard work and will stand by you regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Do not worry about the opinions of others, as they will have opinions regardless of your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

While the exam may seem like the most important thing currently, there is more to life beyond exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Viewing it simply as an exam can make it easier to pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. You are already a doctor in essence; the exam is merely a formality for legal recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Your worth is not defined by this single piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Embrace the challenge with a confident and happy face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

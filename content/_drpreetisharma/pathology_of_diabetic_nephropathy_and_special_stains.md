## Introduction
The 10 on 10 challenge, leading up to NEPG 2025, includes discussions of five images and five MCQs, covering [[Pathology and Microbiology | pathology and microbiology]] topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Day one begins with a case related to diabetic nephropathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation and Initial Findings
A 55-year-old female presented for a regular health checkup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Her complete blood count (CBC) showed normal hemoglobin (12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, normal total leukocyte count (TLC) of 10,000 (normal range 4,000-11,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, and normal platelet counts of 170,000 (normal range 1.5 to 4.5 lakhs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. No abnormality was noted in the differential count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The abnormal finding was an elevated HbA1c of 11%, indicating uncontrolled diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Urine analysis revealed protein 2+ and glucose 3+, as expected, but no casts or crystals were observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A [[Renal Pathology and Cancers | renal biopsy]] was performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Vacutainer Types for Blood Samples
*   For CBC, the purple vacutainer containing EDTA is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   For general glucose samples (fasting, postprandial, random blood sugar), a gray vacutainer is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   For glycated hemoglobin, the purple vacutainer with EDTA is the correct choice, as it tests both glucose and hemoglobin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Pathological Features of Diabetic Nephropathy
Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by several [[Pathological features of various diseases | pathological features]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The findings can be remembered with the mnemonic "The Diabetic Nephropathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Kimmelstein Wilson (KW) Lesion
The most characteristic lesion in diabetic nephropathy is the Kimmelstein Wilson (KW) lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Technical Name:** Nodular Glomerulosclerosis (NGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Appearance:** This involves the glomerulus, where pinkish material forms nodules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The entire glomerulus does not become pink; rather, discrete nodules are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Highlighting Stain:** The **PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) stain** is used to better appreciate these pink nodules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Other Findings in Diabetic Nephropathy
*   **Thickening of the Capillary Basement Membrane:** Capillaries within the glomerulus show thickened basement membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Hyaline Arteriolosclerosis:** This involves the arterioles and capillaries within the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Armani-Epstein Lesion:** This is a condition where the proximal convoluted tubule shows glycogen accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. It is important to note that this is **not a glomerular finding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Diffuse Glomerulosclerosis:** In this condition, the sclerosis (pink material) is present throughout the entire glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Nodular Glomerulosclerosis (KW Lesion):** As described above, this is characterized by pink material forming nodules within the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Capsular Drop and Fibrin Cap:**
    *   **Capsular drop:** Pinkish material dropping from Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Fibrin cap:** Pinkish material sitting on the capillaries, like a cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Papillary Necrosis:** The renal papilla may show tissue death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. While diabetes is the most common cause, other conditions can also lead to it (e.g., [[differential_diagnosis_of_kidney_pathologies | DOSA mnemonic]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Special Stains in Pathology
Several special stains are used in [[Histological and Cytological Features in Pathology | histological and cytological features in pathology]] to identify specific components or conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, contributing to [[various_disease_identifications_using_histopathological_staining_techniques | various disease identifications using histopathological staining techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>:

*   **PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) Stain:** Used to highlight the pink nodules in Kimmelstein Wilson lesions in diabetic nephropathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Verhoeff-Van Gieson (VVG) Stain:** Used for staining elastic tissue, as seen in conditions like temporal arteritis or vasculitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Alcian Blue Stain:** Used for staining acidic mucin, as seen in cases of Barrett's esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) Stain:** Used for identifying acid-fastness, commonly associated with tuberculosis (TB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Congo Red Stain:** Used to confirm amyloidosis, appearing as an apple-green birefringence under polarizing microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TPTC) Stain:** Used in [[Pathology and Microbiology | cardiac pathology]] to assess myocardial infarction (MI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Normal heart tissue stains brick red due to LDH1, while infarcted areas appear pale due to the absence of LDH1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   **Pearls or Prussian Blue Stain:** Used to stain iron, which can be seen deposited around asbestos fibers in asbestos bodies, turning the dumbbell-shaped bodies blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. This identifies "ferruginous bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

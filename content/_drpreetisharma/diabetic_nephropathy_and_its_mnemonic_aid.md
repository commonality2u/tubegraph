[[Diabetic Nephropathy Pathology and Diagnosis | Diabetic nephropathy]] is a condition that affects the kidneys in patients with diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. It is characterized by kidney involvement due to uncontrolled diabetes, glycosuria, and proteinuria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

## Pathological Features and Diagnosis

### Clinical Presentation
Patients with [[Diabetic Nephropathy Pathology and Diagnosis | diabetic nephropathy]] typically present with uncontrolled diabetes, evidenced by elevated HbA1c levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. Urine examination often shows protein (2+), glucose (3+), casts, and crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

### Key Pathological Changes
[[Diabetic Nephropathy Pathology and Diagnosis | Diabetic nephropathy]] involves several key pathological changes in the kidney, which can be remembered using the mnemonic "THE DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>:

*   **T**hickening of the capillaries: One of the earliest changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **H**yaline **A**rteriolosclerosis: A significant blood vessel disease seen in diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.
*   **E** for "Armani Abti" lesion: Refers to glycogen deposits in the proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   **D**iffuse Glomerular Sclerosis: A widespread scarring of the glomeruli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   **N**odular Glomerular Sclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson (K-W) lesion): Characterized by the formation of pink, sclerotic nodules within the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. These lesions are PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a> and are made of glycosylated proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
*   **C**apsular drop and **F**iebig:
    *   Capsular drop: Pinkish material seen "dropping" from Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
    *   Fiebig: Small pinkish dots or rings on the capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. These are also PAS positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
*   **P**apillary Necrosis: The death of the renal papilla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

### Papillary Necrosis
[[Diabetic Nephropathy Pathology and Diagnosis | Papillary necrosis]] can be caused by various factors, which can be remembered by the mnemonic "PAPADOSA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>:

*   **P**apillary Necrosis is the most common cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
*   **D**iabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
*   **O**bstructive disorders of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **S**ickle cell anemia/trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **A**nalgesic abuse (e.g., paracetamol overuse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

## Pre-Exam Day Preparation

*   **Wrap up studying early**
    *   Conclude all studying activities by 7:00 to 7:30 PM on the evening before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
    *   If you have a personal volatile list, review that. Otherwise, scan images from Pathology, Microbiology, Ortho, and Radiology as they often appear as classical spotter images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Avoid studying after 8 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Prioritize sleep**
    *   Ensure you get a good night's sleep to settle down and ease yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Complete your checklist**
    *   Review your entire checklist for the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   Have your admit card ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Prepare a valid ID proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   Verify that the name on your ID proof matches the name on your admit card, checking for any spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Do not paste a photograph on your admit card, as per the email instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   Keep your ID in an easily accessible and secure place to avoid losing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Confirm the exact location of your exam centre beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Exam Day Logistics and Strategy

*   **Arrive early**
    *   Entry for Paper 1 begins at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM. Do not arrive at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   Reach the centre well in advance to allow yourself time to relax and let your heart rate return to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Manage the break between papers**
    *   Avoid discussing questions or engaging in chats with other students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Do not participate in recall sessions during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
    *   Consume something light and energizing to maintain focus for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Expect varied difficulty**
    *   Typically, one paper will be easier, and the other will be more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   If Paper 1 seems difficult, do not get discouraged or feel your journey is over; focus on Paper 2, as it might be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Question-solving technique**
    *   Adopt a "switch on, switch off" mode for each question: focus entirely on the current question, then move on without dwelling on past errors or future questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   There is no negative marking, so attempt all questions, regardless of perceived difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    *   Expect 10-20 "bouncers" or extremely difficult questions per paper that even experts might struggle with. Do not waste time on these; make an educated guess and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These questions are designed to test the exam's screening level and are not meant to be solved by everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
    *   Focus on avoiding [[silly_mistakes_in_fmge_exam | silly mistakes]] on easier questions rather than getting hung up on tough ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   Spend approximately 45 seconds on each question. Mark your answer and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
    *   Trust your first gut feeling; it is often correct. Avoid overthinking and changing answers, especially in the last few minutes, as this often leads to errors caused by panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
    *   Read the entire question and all options, even if it seems familiar or simple, to avoid missing any twists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
    *   The paper will be balanced, with some quick one-liner questions and some lengthy ones. Don't worry if some take longer than 50 seconds; the quicker ones will balance it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
    *   It is normal for the first 10-15 minutes to be slower as you settle in. Do not panic if your speed is low initially; you will pick up pace later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Mindset and Well-being

*   **Maintain positivity**
    *   Avoid thinking negatively or feeling anxious that you have forgotten everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Such thoughts can increase [[silly_mistakes_in_fmge_exam | silly mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
    *   Focus on positive affirmations, believing that the paper will be easy and you will avoid [[silly_mistakes_in_fmge_exam | silly mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   Count your blessings and trust in God, the universe, or the blessings of your parents and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   From now until the end of the exam, commit to thinking only positive thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Combat self-doubt**
    *   Believe in yourself and your preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Your first gut feeling is often correct because you don't have the pressure of the exam when practicing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   Sanity is crucial to cross the minimum passing score of 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
    *   Understand that minor human errors will occur; do not let them escalate due to panic or anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Manage external pressure**
    *   Ignore those who might judge you if you don't clear the exam. Your true supporters (teachers, parents) know your hard work and will stand by you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
    *   This exam is just one part of life and a formality for becoming a doctor; your worth is not defined by this single piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **Confidence levels**
    *   Be super confident about yourself and your preparation until 8:30 AM on exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
    *   Once you sit in front of the computer screen, shift to a practical mindset: read every question and option carefully, and use elimination if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
    *   If you are already confident, be careful not to make [[silly_mistakes_in_fmge_exam | silly mistakes]] due to overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

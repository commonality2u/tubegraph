Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a condition observed in the breast, often associated with a distinct microscopic appearance and a specific genetic alteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A 58-year-old woman may present with irregular nodularity in her breast, palpable over several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Mammography might reveal irregular densities in both breasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This condition can be bilateral and multicentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Histopathological Findings
A needle biopsy typically shows characteristic malignant cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The distinguishing feature is the arrangement of tumor cells in a "classical Indian file pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This means the tumor cells are aligned in a single, disciplined straight line, one behind the other, resembling Indian army men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

While LCIS is considered a premalignant condition, it can also manifest as proper lobular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Genetic Basis
The development of lobular carcinoma is linked to a downregulation of the E-cadherin protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The gene responsible for E-cadherin is the **CDH1 gene**, which is defective in this condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

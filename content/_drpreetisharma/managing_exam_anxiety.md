Effectively [[strategies_to_manage_exam_anxiety | managing exam anxiety]] is crucial for optimal performance. This article provides [[practical_exam_instructions_and_strategies | practical strategies]] for before and during the exam, emphasizing a positive mindset and self-belief.

## Before the Exam

To minimize pre-exam stress, it's advised to wrap up studying by 7:00-7:30 PM the evening before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The primary goal should be to settle down, ease oneself, and ensure a good night's sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, contributing to [[balancing_exam_preparation_with_personal_health | balancing exam preparation with personal health]].

### Essential Checklist
Before the exam day, confirm the following items from your checklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>:
*   **Admit Card and ID Proof:** Ensure your admit card is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Carry a valid ID proof, verifying that the name on the ID matches the name on the admit card without any spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. A photograph typically does not need to be pasted on the admit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Keep your ID in an easily accessible and secure place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Exam Centre Location:** Confirm the exact location of your exam centre in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Arrival Time:** Plan to arrive well before the entry deadline (e.g., entry for Paper 1 starts at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Arriving early allows time to calm down and get your heart rate back to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Last-Minute Study Tips
If you wish to study until the evening (e.g., 7:30-8:00 PM), prioritize your own "volatile list" of topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. If you're unsure what to review, scan through images from subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Orthopedics, and Radiology, as they often feature classical "spotter" images useful in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Avoid attempting to complete broad subjects like Medicine at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

## During the Exam
Maintaining composure and focus during the exam is vital for [[handling_examrelated_anxiety_and_stress | handling exam-related anxiety and stress]].

### Navigating Multiple Papers
*   **Avoid Discussion Between Papers:** Do not discuss Paper 1 with anyone before Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Engaging in discussions about questions you may have missed or answered incorrectly can unnecessarily raise anxiety for the subsequent paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Light Refreshments:** During the break between papers, consume light food and drinks that provide energy for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Focus on nutrition rather than studying or discussing.

### Handling Question Difficulty
*   **Balanced Papers:** Exams often feature a balance of easy and difficult questions; one paper might be easier, and the other more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Do not despair if the first paper feels overwhelmingly difficult, as the second might be relatively easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Identify "Bouncer" Questions:** Expect 10-20 "bouncer" questions in each paper that are exceptionally difficult or seem outside the usual syllabus, designed to maintain a competitive level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These are not meant for everyone to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Do not let these questions demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Focus on Solvable Questions:** Concentrate on the other questions where you can avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Making errors on easy questions due to anxiety is more regrettable than not knowing a tough one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **No Negative Marking:** Since there is no negative marking, attempt all questions, even the tough ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. For bouncer questions, it's acceptable to make an educated guess, pick an option, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### [[mcq_examination_tips | MCQ Examination Tips]]
*   **"Switch On/Switch Off" Mode:** For each question, focus entirely on it ("switch on"), attempt it, and then immediately move on to the next one, forgetting the previous question ("switch off") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This prevents dwelling on past errors or future concerns.
*   **Read Questions and Options Carefully:** Even if a question seems familiar, read it entirely, including all options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. A small twist in the wording can change the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut Feeling (Initially):** In crucial moments like exams, your first gut feeling is often correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, especially since you don't have the pressure during preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overthinking and Late Changes:** Do not overthink questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Resist the urge to change many answers in the last few minutes of the exam due to panic or overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>; stick with your initial gut feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Pacing:** Some questions will be quick one-liners, while others will be lengthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Don't worry if a question takes longer than the average 50 seconds; the exam paper is balanced, and quicker questions will make up for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **Slow Start is Normal:** It's normal for the first 15 minutes of an exam to feel slow as you adjust and your heart rate settles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Don't worry if you solve fewer questions initially; your pace will pick up, and you'll cover any lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

## Mindset and Positivity

*   **Combat Negativity:** Avoid carrying negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Instead, count your blessings and believe that good will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Until the exam ends, focus only on positive thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Self-Belief:** Believe in yourself and your preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Your hard work in rapid revisions, notes, and previous year questions is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. You have performed well in practice sessions; this confidence should extend to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Confidence vs. Overconfidence:** Until you reach the exam hall (e.g., 8:30 AM), maintain super confidence, believing your preparation, strategy, teachers, and sources were the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Once you sit in front of the screen, adopt a sane and practical mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Be wary of overconfidence leading to silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Embrace Human Error:** Understand that making a few silly mistakes is human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Do not let these errors be amplified by panic or anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Beyond the Exam:** Remember that clearing this exam (aiming for at least 150 marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>) is important, but it's just one challenge in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. True worth is not defined by one piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Your teachers and parents recognize your hard work and will stand by you regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Do not be concerned about judgment from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Fighter's Spirit:** Recognize yourself as a fighter who has overcome many struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This exam is a small challenge compared to the larger ones you have faced and will face as a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

### Role of Faith and Superstition
For some, adhering to a personal faith or superstition can provide a sense of security and ward off negativity during this crucial time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Clinging to this belief can help maintain a positive outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

*Balantidium coli* is identified as the most likely cause of certain clinical presentations based on stool examination findings [00:08:11].

## Characteristics
*Balantidium coli* is a ciliated protozoan [00:08:07], with its name "coli" being associated with "cili" (ciliated) [00:08:18], [00:08:34], [00:10:03]. It is notable for its "big" characteristics [00:08:39].

### Size and Location
It is considered one of the largest protozoa known [00:08:47], [00:09:56]. This parasite primarily inhabits the large intestine (or "big intestine") [00:08:52], [00:09:45].

### Forms and Structure
*Balantidium coli* exists in two forms: a trophozoite and a cyst [00:09:03].
*   **Cyst**: The cyst is the infective stage of the parasite [00:09:08], [00:09:16].
*   **Nuclei**: Both the trophozoite and the cyst forms are binucleated, meaning they possess two nuclei [00:09:27], [00:09:30], [00:09:47]. These nuclei include a large, bean-shaped macronucleus and a smaller, dot-like micronucleus [00:09:35], [00:09:48].

### Motility
As a ciliated parasite, *Balantidium coli* exhibits rotatory motility [00:09:58], [00:10:03], [00:10:06].

## Clinical Presentation
In affected individuals, *Balantidium coli* can cause symptoms such as bloody loose motions, fever, and abdominal pain [00:07:53], which are indicative of diarrhea [00:08:57], [00:08:58]. A history of travel may also be associated with infection [00:07:59].

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis is typically made through stool examination, where the ciliated protozoa can be observed microscopically [00:08:07].

## Treatment
The drug of choice for treating infections caused by *Balantidium coli* is Doxycycline [00:10:18], [00:10:19].

## Introduction to Microscopy
Microscopy is fundamental in various fields, including microbiology, to visualize structures not visible to the naked eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The choice of microscope depends on the specific requirements for observation, such as resolution, magnification, and the type of specimen.

## [[Introduction to different types of microscopy | Types of Microscopy]]

### Light Microscope
A common type is the [[Light and electron microscopy in microbiology | light microscope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In a light microscope, transmitted light is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
Key components of a light microscope include:
*   **Condenser**: Located below the stage, it focuses light onto the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Stage**: The platform where the specimen is placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Objective Lens**: Magnifies the object (e.g., 4x, 10x, 40x, 100x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Eyepiece Lens**: The lens through which the observer looks, usually 10x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The total magnification of a light microscope is the product of the eyepiece and objective lens magnifications; for example, a 10x eyepiece with a 100x objective gives a total of 1000x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Fluorescent Microscope
A [[Light and electron microscopy in microbiology | fluorescent microscope]] resembles a light microscope but includes added dichroic mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. It uses ultraviolet (UV) light as its light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The dichroic mirrors convert short-wavelength light to longer-wavelength light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

#### [[Microbial identification and staining techniques | Fluorescent Stains]]
*   **Auramine-Rhodamine Stain**: Used for [[mycology and fungal stains | Mycobacterial TB]] (Tuberculosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Acridine Orange**: A fluorescent stain for malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Calcofluor White**: A fluorescent stain used for identifying fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   *Note*: Rhodanine is a different stain used for copper, relevant in [[various_disease_identifications_using_histopathological_staining_techniques | Wilson's Disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Electron Microscope
The [[Diagnosis using electron microscopy | electron microscope]] is enclosed and maintains a vacuum, as it uses electrons instead of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Viruses are typically seen using an electron microscope because they cannot be observed with a normal light microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Other Important Staining Techniques

### Negative Staining
Used for organisms like *Cryptococcus* where the background is stained, leaving the organism clear. Examples include:
*   **India ink**: Used for CSF samples to detect *Cryptococcus* in living patients (e.g., HIV-positive patients with meningitis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:55">[02:22:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Nigrosin**: Another negative stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:58">[02:29:58]</a>.

### Histopathological Stains
*   **Mayer's Mucicarmine Stain**: Used for brain biopsy or autopsy samples to identify *Cryptococcus* (appears pinkish-red) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Lactophenol Cotton Blue (LPCB)**: Used for staining fungi, giving them a blue appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
*   **Albert Stain**: Used for *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* to identify volutin granules. It contains toluidine blue, iodine, and malachite green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
    *   Bacteria appear malachite green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>.
    *   Volutin granules appear bluish-purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:46">[01:40:46]</a>.
*   **Neisser Stain**: Another stain for volutin granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Loeffler's Methylene Blue**: Considered the best stain for volutin granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>.
*   **Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) Stain**: A common stain for [[microbial_culture_and_staining_techniques | Mycobacterial TB]] (Acid-Fast Bacilli) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>.
*   **Dienes Stain**: Used to visualize *Mycoplasma* colonies, which are very small and show a "fried egg appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>.
*   **Warthin-Starry Silver Stain**: Used for *H. pylori* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Jaswant Singh-Bhattacharya Stain**: Used to differentiate *malaria* species based on their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Scotch Tape Method**: Used to collect *Enterobius vermicularis* eggs from the perianal region due to nocturnal egg-laying behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This method is used because eggs are not typically found in stool samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Floxine-Tartrate Stain**: Used for Henderson-Patterson (HP) bodies in *Molluscum contagiosum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

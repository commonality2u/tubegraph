Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) is a mesenchymal or stromal tumor that can occur in the stomach and intestine, though it is more commonly found in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A patient presenting with GIST may complain of upper [[git_and_liver_diseases | GI]] pain and tarry stools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Endoscopy might reveal a firm, smooth, yellowish submucosal mass in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Biopsy of the mass typically shows spindle cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Pathogenesis
GIST originates from the Cells of Cajal, which are known as the pacemaker cells of the [[git_and_liver_diseases | GIT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Mutations
*   **c-KIT/CD117 Mutation**: The most common mutation observed in GIST is the CD117 or c-KIT mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This mutation leads to an increase in tyrosine kinase activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **PDGF Mutation**: PDGF mutations can also be seen in GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **SDH Mutation**: SDH (succinate dehydrogenase) mutation is associated with pediatric GIST, which is typically seen in small children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Diagnosis
### Markers
*   **Sensitive Marker**: c-KIT or CD117 is considered the most sensitive marker for GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Specific Marker**: DOG1 (Diagnostic Of GIST) is the specific marker for GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Treatment
While surgery is the ideal treatment for GIST, a drug treatment is available. Due to the increased tyrosine kinase activity caused by mutations, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor like Imatinib is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Imatinib is also used in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a blood cancer featuring the Philadelphia chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

A [[ovarian_tumors_and_pathological_features | granulosa cell tumor]] is a type of ovarian tumor commonly observed in post-menopausal women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. It is characterized by specific genetic mutations and distinct microscopic findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

Patients, typically post-menopausal women, may present with symptoms such as bleeding per vaginum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This is due to the tumor causing hyperestrogenism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, which can lead to a bulky uterus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Etiology

The development of [[ovarian_tumors_and_pathological_features | granulosa cell tumor]] is linked to a FOX L2 gene mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This mutation leads to elevated estrogen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Pathological Features

Microscopic examination of a [[ovarian_tumors_and_pathological_features | granulosa cell tumor]] reveals several key features:

*   **Call-Exner bodies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>: These are classic findings where tumor cells are arranged in a round fashion with pink material in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Nuclear grooves** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>: These grooves give the appearance of "coffee beans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Tumor Markers

*   **Inhibin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>: This is a tumor marker associated with [[ovarian_tumors_and_pathological_features | granulosa cell tumor]].
*   **CD99** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>: The tumor is also positive for CD99.

## Differential Diagnosis

The "coffee bean appearance" seen in [[ovarian_tumors_and_pathological_features | granulosa cell tumor]] can also be observed in a [[ovarian_tumors_and_pathological_features | Brenner tumor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

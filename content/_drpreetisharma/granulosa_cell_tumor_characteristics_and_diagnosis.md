Granulosa cell tumors are ovarian tumors commonly observed in post-menopausal women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

A common presentation is bleeding per vaginum in the post-menopausal phase, which is unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Ultrasound may reveal a bulky uterus with an adnexal mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Etiology and Hormonal Effects

The primary reason for granulosa cell tumors is a FOX L2 gene mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This mutation leads to elevated estrogen levels, resulting in [[hyperestrogenism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The increased estrogen causes the uterus to become bulky and can lead to bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## [[Histological and Cytological Features in Pathology | Histological Features]]

Under the microscope, granulosa cell tumors exhibit several characteristic features:
*   **Call-Exner bodies** These are classical findings where tumor cells are arranged in a round fashion with pink material in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Nuclear grooves (Coffee Bean Appearance)** The cells display nuclear grooves, giving them a "coffee bean appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Immunohistochemistry

Granulosa cell tumors are positive for the tumor marker inhibin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. They are also positive for CD99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis

Another ovarian tumor that can exhibit the "coffee bean appearance" is a Brenner tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Effective study and quiz preparation in microbiology involves a structured approach to content review, strategic question practice, and utilizing available resources. The current study plan shifts focus from systemic pathology to microbiology for several weeks, continuing until the end of March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Afterwards, the schedule will alternate back to topics like General Pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Study Schedule and Resources

Specialized classes on specific topics relevant to exams like IICT, including Electron Microscopy, Immunohistochemistry, Flow Cytometry, Genetics of Leukemia, Hepatitis, and Meningitis questions, will be covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These classes will provide the necessary content, so a separate list is not required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The speaker's pathology and microbiology classes are scheduled for the first week of April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

For [[microbiology_mixed_question_sessions | mixed question sessions]], current topics include cocci (Staph, Strep, Neisseria, Moraxella) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23">[02:23]</a>. Future topics will include gram-positive bacillus, utilizing mnemonics like "McDonald" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>.

### Last Minute Revision (LRR)
[[bacteriology_revision_strategies | Last Minute Revision (LRR)]] sessions will be conducted on the PrepLadder YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The earliest LRR, for IICT, is tentatively scheduled to begin on March 25th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, with the timetable expected in approximately a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Tentative timings for Path and Micro LRR are 12 o'clock on April 9th and 10th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>. LRR sessions will also be available for NEET PG and FMG, possibly running concurrently due to exam proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>. Every exam will have its own LRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.

### PDF Availability
PDFs of session content will always be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Quizzes and Question Practice
Daily quizzes with five to six questions are provided on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00">[03:00]</a>. These quizzes include commonly asked previous year questions (PYQs) and potential new questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:03">[01:33:03]</a>. Engaging with these quizzes takes minimal time, around five minutes, and can be done conveniently, even while walking or eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>.

### Question Approach
When encountering [[bacteriology_quizzes_and_strategies | bacteriology quizzes and strategies]] during an exam, it is crucial to first categorize the question by chapter before attempting to answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32">[03:32]</a>. Patience is key while reading questions, waiting for that "buzz word" that simplifies identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:55">[01:59:55]</a>.

### Content Mastery
For [[microbiology_study_techniques_for_exams | microbiology study techniques for exams]], visual memory is important, so reviewing the same slides repeatedly is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Mnemonics are useful, but it's important to understand the core concept behind them to avoid forgetting details during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

Contentment is vital in subjects like microbiology and pharmacology, as the vastness of information can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:25">[02:27:25]</a>. It's better to focus on mastering a manageable amount of information and continually revising it, rather than getting caught in the "fear of missing out" (FOMO). Instead, embrace the "joy of missing out" (JOMO) â€“ being happy with the knowledge you *do* possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:56">[02:43:56]</a>.

### Specific Study Targets
A comprehensive list of 40-45 organisms, including fungi, will be created in two pages. This list will detail their respective drugs of choice and significant resistance mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This will be an ongoing task, with a few organisms being covered daily, rather than all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

It is important to study the updated content, especially if it's the first time reading a topic, as new editions (like Rabin's 10th edition) may introduce changes and updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:02">[01:30:02]</a>.

## Homework
A recurring homework assignment is to study "cat sit on a mat" which pertains to agglutination tests in immunology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>. This covers three specific organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:40">[01:51:40]</a>.

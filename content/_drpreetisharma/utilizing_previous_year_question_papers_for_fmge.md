Previous year question papers (PYQs) are a critical component of [[fmge_preparation_strategy | FMGE preparation]]. While they serve as a valuable resource for understanding the format and frequently tested topics, their utility has evolved with changes in exam patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Importance of PYQs
*   **Fact-Based Questions**: Historically, previous year questions were often fact-based, single-line questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Topic Identification**: PYQs help identify "previous air topics" that examiners frequently ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This allows candidates to focus on recurring themes rather than just memorizing answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Source for Practice**: FMG Solutions is recommended as a source for textbook-based PYQs, providing explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Evolution of Exam Pattern and PYQ Strategy
The [[exam_preparation_strategy_for_fmge | FMGE exam pattern]] has become increasingly clinical, featuring longer, more intricate questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. While PYQs are still essential, a sole reliance on them is insufficient for success in the current format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Limitations of Traditional PYQ Practice
*   **Fact-Based vs. Clinical**: Simply solving past papers, especially older fact-based ones, may not prepare candidates for the clinical and lengthy questions seen in recent exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Time Management**: Long, multi-line questions require effective [[time_management_techniques_for_fmge | time management]] and the ability to quickly identify "buzzwords" or highlighted points within a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. This practice is crucial to overcome fear of lengthy questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.

### Recommended Approach for PYQs
*   **FMG Papers**: Candidates should complete at least five years of FMG PYQs, which equates to ten sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.
*   **NEET PG Papers**: Supplement FMG PYQs with NEET PG papers. A minimum of three years of NEET PG papers is recommended, with an extension to five years if time permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   **Clinical Question Banks**: To address the evolving clinical nature of the exam, it is advised to practice from a clinical question bank, such as those available on platforms like Prepladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. These banks provide the solid, lengthy questions needed for current exam preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Daily Practice**: Incorporate question-solving alongside theoretical study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Initially, aim for 50 questions a day and gradually increase to 100-150 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. Maintain a consistent daily target of 100 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.
*   **Focused Review**: After solving questions, identify weak areas or topics where mistakes were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. Focus revision on these specific topics rather than re-reading entire subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   **Source Consistency**: It is crucial to stick to one chosen platform or set of notes for theory and questions. Changing sources frequently is not advisable, especially closer to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. Small additions or updates can be incorporated, but a complete change of source is discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.

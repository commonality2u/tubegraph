## Before the Exam Day

*   **Final Study Wrap-up** Students should aim to conclude their studies by 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM the evening before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07"></a>.
*   **Prioritize Sleep** A good night's sleep is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07"></a>.
*   **Checklist for Logistics**
    *   Ensure your admit card is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07"></a>.
    *   Have a valid ID proof, ensuring the name matches the admit card without spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07"></a>. Note that a photograph does not need to be pasted on the admit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07"></a>.
    *   Keep your ID in an easily accessible and secure place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07"></a>.
    *   Confirm your exam center location in advance to avoid morning rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:07"></a>.
*   **Arrival Time** Entry for Paper 1 begins at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM. It's crucial to arrive well in advance to settle down and normalize your heart rate before the exam begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:07"></a>.

## During the Exam

### Mindset and Approach

*   **Avoid Discussions Between Papers** Do not engage in discussions about Paper 1 with other students between sessions. Hearing about missed questions or mistakes can negatively impact your mental state for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07"></a>.
*   **Focus on Nourishment** Use the break between papers to consume light, energy-giving food and drinks, rather than discussing or studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:07"></a>.
*   **"Switch On/Switch Off" Strategy for Questions** For each question, concentrate solely on it ("switch on"), attempt it, then immediately move on ("switch off") without dwelling on past questions or anticipating future ones. This helps maintain focus and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:07"></a>.
*   **Handling Tough Papers**
    *   Expect that one paper might be tougher and the other easier to balance the overall exam difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:07"></a>.
    *   If Paper 1 seems difficult, do not lose hope for the entire exam; Paper 2 might be simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:07"></a>.
    *   The goal is to pass the minimum threshold (e.g., 150 marks), and sanity is key to achieving this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:07"></a>.
*   **Managing Difficult Questions (Bouncers)**
    *   Anticipate 10-20 "bouncer" questions in each paper that are exceptionally difficult, even for experts, and may not seem directly from the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:07"></a>.
    *   These questions are included for screening purposes and are not meant to be solved by everyone, including toppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:07"></a>.
    *   Do not get demotivated by these questions, especially if they appear consecutively. Acknowledge them, make an educated guess (e.g., mark A, B, C, or D), and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:07"></a>.
    *   Focus on correctly answering the easier questions, as making [[silly_mistakes]] on them can be more regrettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:07"></a>.
*   **Combatting Negativity and Self-Doubt**
    *   Avoid allowing negative thoughts or self-doubt to creep in, as this can lead to [[silly_mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07"></a>.
    *   Believe in your preparation and the hard work you've put in. Your teachers and parents are supportive regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:07"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:07"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:07"></a>.
    *   Maintain a positive mindset and a smile, even when facing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:07"></a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut Feeling**
    *   In crucial moments like the exam, your first gut feeling for an answer is often correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:07"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:07"></a>.
    *   Avoid overthinking, especially when reviewing answers at the end. Changing multiple answers due to last-minute panic can lead to more mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:07"></a>.
*   **Reading Questions Carefully**
    *   Allocate sufficient time (e.g., 45 seconds) to analyze each question. Even if a question seems familiar, read the entire question and all options thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:07"></a>.
    *   Do not skim or make assumptions, as questions might have subtle twists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:07"></a>.
*   **Pacing and Time Management**
    *   While a target of 50 seconds per question is ideal, some questions will be one-liners and quick, while others will be lengthier. The paper is balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:07"></a>.
    *   Don't panic if your speed is slower in the first 15 minutes; it's normal to take time to settle in. You will likely pick up the pace later and cover any initial lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:07"></a>.
*   **Dealing with Pressure** Expect that the exam environment will naturally increase pressure, which might make you take a little more time per question initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:07"></a>.

## Post-Exam

*   The exam is merely a formality to gain a legal doctor's title; it does not define your actual worth or hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:07"></a>.

Ovarian tumors are often classified based on their epithelial origin, and understanding the characteristic features of these epithelia is crucial for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. Key features include the presence of single or multiple cysts, the type of fluid contained within, and specific cellular characteristics seen on [[Histology and its correlation with specific renal tumors | histology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

## Surface Epithelial Tumors

The categories of serous, mucinous, and [[Identification and characteristics of brain tumors | Brenner]] tumors fall under the umbrella of surface epithelial tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. These tumors commonly share a specific tumor marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

*   **Tumor Marker:** CA125 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>.

### Serous Cystadenoma

*   **Characteristics:** Typically a single (uniloculated) cyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   **Fluid:** Contains clear, watery fluid, referred to as serous fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.
*   **Epithelium:** Lined by ciliated epithelium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>.
*   **Histology:** Often shows psammoma bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

### Mucinous Cystadenoma

*   **Characteristics:** Typically features multiple (multiloculated) cysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>.
*   **Fluid:** Contains mucin (mucinous fluid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
*   **Epithelium:** Composed of mucin-containing epithelial cells, often appearing as empty "mouse cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.

### Brenner Tumor

*   **Epithelium:** Characterized by nests of cells resembling the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Feature:** Exhibits a "coffee bean" nucleus, which appears as a nucleus with a line running through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
*   **Association:** In approximately 25% of cases, [[Granulosa Cell Tumor  Characteristics and Diagnosis | Brenner tumors]] are associated with mucinous tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

## [[Granulosa Cell Tumor  Characteristics and Diagnosis | Granulosa Cell Tumor]]

[[Granulosa Cell Tumor  Characteristics and Diagnosis | Granulosa cell tumors]] are typically seen in older, postmenopausal females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.

*   **Clinical Presentation:** Can present with abnormal uterine bleeding and a bulky uterus due to increased estrogen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>. These tumors are hyperestrogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.
*   **Immunohistochemistry:** Positive for CD99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>.
*   **Histological Features:**
    *   **Call-Exner bodies:** Characterized by cells arranged circularly around a central pink, hyalinized material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
    *   **Nuclear Grooves:** Also show nuclear grooves, leading to a "coffee bean" nucleus appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>.
*   **Genetic Mutation:** Associated with FOXL2 gene mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.
*   **Tumor Marker:** Inhibin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.

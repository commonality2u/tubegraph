Preparing for an exam can be a stressful time, and it's normal to experience panic, an increased heart rate, and palpitations as the exam day approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This article provides [[anxiety_and_stress_management_for_students | strategies for managing stress and anxiety]] on the day of and immediately before the exam.

## Pre-Exam Day Preparation

*   **Final Study Wrap-Up**: Aim to finish studying by 7-7:30 PM the day before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. If you have a specific "volatile list" of things to review, stick to that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Otherwise, scan through images, particularly from subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Orthopedics, and Radiology, as their photos often appear as classical "spotter" images that can help in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. [[lastminute_study_strategies | Last-minute study strategies]] should be light and focused.
*   **Prioritize Rest**: Settle down, ease yourself, and ensure a good night's sleep, which is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Avoid studying subjects like Medicine late into the night, as they are too vast to cover effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **Pre-Exam Checklist**: Go through your checklist the evening before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>:
    *   Ensure your admit card is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Prepare a valid ID proof, confirming that the name on the ID matches the name on the admit card without spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   Note that you do not need to paste a photograph on the admit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   Keep your ID in an easily accessible place to avoid misplacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Confirm the exact location of your exam center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Exam Day Management

*   **Arrive Early**: Entry for Paper 1 starts at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Arrive well in advance to allow time for your heart rate to normalize before the exam begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Avoid Discussion Between Papers**: Do not sit and chat or discuss Paper 1 questions with others between Paper 1 and Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Discussing answers can create unnecessary anxiety and difficulty for the second paper, especially if you discover a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Light Refreshments**: During the break, eat or drink something light that provides energy for Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Balanced Papers**: Be prepared for one paper to be relatively easy and the other to be more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Don't let a difficult Paper 1 discourage you, as Paper 2 might be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **"Switch On, Switch Off" Mode**: For each question, focus only on the present question. Don't dwell on previous questions or worry about future ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Engage with the question ("switch on"), attempt it, then move on ("switch off") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Difficult Questions**:
    *   Expect 10-20 "bouncer" questions in each paper that are exceptionally difficult or obscure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These are not meant for everyone to solve and are there to maintain the exam's competitive level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
    *   Do not let these questions derail your motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    *   For bouncers, smile, pick an answer (A, B, C, or D), and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Don't worry about them, as they are difficult for everyone, including toppers and experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Focus on Easy Questions**: Your primary focus should be on avoiding silly mistakes in the easier, solvable questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Regret over silly mistakes lasts longer than over difficult questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Maintain a Positive Mindset**:
    *   Avoid carrying negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Repeatedly tell yourself the paper will be easy and you won't make silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   Believe in yourself and count your blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. If you go in with a positive mindset, your heart rate will be normal, and silly mistakes will be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
    *   Avoid self-doubt, even if you feel you haven't studied well or don't remember everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Your innate knowledge often guides your first gut feeling correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   Embrace a belief or superstition that gives you security and faith, preventing you from attracting negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut Feeling**:
    *   Do not overthink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Overthinking creates problems in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
    *   Spend about 45 seconds analyzing a question, mark your answer, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
    *   Avoid changing many answers in the last 15 minutes out of panic, as your first gut feeling is often correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Confidence vs. Overconfidence**:
    *   Maintain high confidence until you sit down at the computer screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Believe your preparation, strategy, teachers, and sources were the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. This confidence helps you reach the exam hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
    *   Once at the computer, shift to a sane and practical mindset. Read every question and option carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Don't make silly mistakes due to overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
    *   If you find a question challenging, try ruling out options to arrive at the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Pacing the Exam**:
    *   Some questions will be one-liners, others lengthy. The paper will be balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
    *   Don't worry if a question takes more than 50 seconds; one-liners or image-based questions will balance the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
    *   A slower pace in the first 15 minutes is normal as you settle in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This initial lag will be covered as you pick up speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   **Don't Let External Opinions Burden You**: Your teachers and parents know you've worked hard and will stand by you regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Don't worry about what others who don't understand your journey might think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **Perspective on Exams**: Remember that life is more than just one exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This exam is a formality, a small challenge compared to the challenges you've already faced and will face as doctors saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Your actual worth is not defined by one piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

```ad-note
Manifest positive thoughts and believe in your capabilities. You are already doctors; this exam is merely a formality to put a name to your profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

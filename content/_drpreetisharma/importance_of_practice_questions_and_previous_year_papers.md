Practicing questions, especially [[MCQ practice for competitive exams | MCQs]] and previous year papers, is a critical component of exam preparation, particularly for competitive medical exams like FMG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:02:04]</a>. This approach helps in understanding concepts, managing time, and getting accustomed to the exam pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Integrating [[MCQ practice for competitive exams | MCQs]] with Theory

For exams like the FMG on January 20th, it is crucial to practice [[MCQ practice for competitive exams | MCQs]] alongside theoretical study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Due to the limited time available (approximately two months), a "first theory, then [[MCQ practice for competitive exams | MCQs]]" approach is not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Instead, [[MCQ practice for competitive exams | MCQs]] should be integrated daily with theory, for instance, by solving questions related to a chapter immediately after studying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Sources for Questions

Two primary sources for questions are recommended:
*   **Question Bank (Q bank)**: Utilize any existing Q bank subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. There's no need to purchase new resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**: Focus on previous year *topics* rather than rote memorization of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. For example, if "apoptosis" has appeared multiple times, study the apoptosis topic from your pathology notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This can be done via app-based solutions or FMG textbooks for those who prefer physical books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. NEET PG and AIIMS CET previous year questions (especially from the last three years and the most recent exams) are also valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:06:00">[52:06:00]</a>.

## Daily [[MCQ practice for competitive exams | MCQ]] Targets

A daily target of 100+ [[MCQ practice for competitive exams | MCQs]] is generally advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. If this seems daunting, start with 50 questions and gradually increase the number by 5-7 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. Within a week to ten days, you should be able to reach the 100-question mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>. The focus should be on finishing topics and their associated questions, rather than adhering strictly to a numerical target for every subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:26:00">[53:26:00]</a>.

## The Role of Grand Tests (GTs) and [[Practical exam instructions and strategies | Exam Simulation]]

Grand Tests are essential for exam preparation, even if you don't feel fully ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.
*   **Minimum Number**: Aim to take at least five Grand Tests before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:11]</a>.
*   **Primary Focus**: The main objective of GTs is *time management*, not the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>. GTs help you learn to maintain pace (e.g., 45-50 seconds per question) and stay alert throughout the exam duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:06]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: GTs help you get used to sitting for long stretches, unlike typical study habits involving frequent breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. They also help identify silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:56:00">[43:56:00]</a>.
*   **Scoring**: Do not get disheartened by scores in GTs, as platform tests are often designed to be tougher than the actual exam to encourage further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>. A score of 150+ in a GT might translate to 170-180+ in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>.

## Analyzing Performance in GTs

Analysis of GTs should be strategic:
*   **Correct Questions**: If you answered a question correctly, quickly review the corresponding topic in your notes. There's no need to read lengthy explanations provided in the Q bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>.
*   **Incorrect Questions**: Focus heavily on analyzing incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>. Read the explanations thoroughly from the source you are using for the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.

## Learning from Exam Patterns

Past exams, like the July 30th FMG exam, offer valuable insights:
*   **Image-Based Questions (IBQs)**: IBQs are significant and help quickly identify questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:05]</a>. While the number can fluctuate, they typically range from 65-70 questions, but have been as high as 130 out of 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>.
*   **Mixed Bag Questions**: Exams feature a mix of one-liner and clinical (longer) questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>. Do not assume only long clinical questions will appear, as this would make the exam impossible to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:23:00">[33:23:00]</a>.

## Practicing for Higher Scores

For those aiming for 200+ scores, simply doing 100 [[MCQ practice for competitive exams | MCQs]] per day might not be enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:34:00">[36:34:00]</a>. Consider using two apps or two sources of questions to expose yourself to a wider range of new topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:42:00">[36:42:00]</a>.

## Maintaining [[MCQ examination tips | MCQ]] Practice Close to the Exam

Even in the last 15-20 days before the exam, notes should remain your primary focus (60-65% of study time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:25:00">[31:25:00]</a>. However, do not stop solving [[MCQ practice for competitive exams | MCQs]] entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>. While Grand Tests can be skipped in the very last 15 days to avoid unnecessary tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:44:00">[31:44:00]</a>, continue engaging with questions through crash courses or other sessions where knowledge is being spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>.

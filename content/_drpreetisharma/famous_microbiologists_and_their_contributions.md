This article reviews the historical aspects and key contributions of notable scientists in the field of [[microbiology_introduction_and_scheduling | microbiology]], particularly relevant for FMG students and other medical aspirants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Historically, questions from scientists' contributions have appeared in previous FMG exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Louis Pasteur
Louis Pasteur is considered one of the most important scientists in [[introduction_to_bacteriology | bacteriology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Contributions:
*   **Pasteurization of milk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Established the **Pasteur Institute in Paris** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Developed the **first liquid medium** for microbial culture, distinguishing it from later solid media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Known as the **"Father of Microbiology"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Fermentation principle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Described the **autoclave** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   Introduced the **germ theory** (for acceptance) and advocated for the rejection of abiogenesis theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Developed "CAR" vaccines:
    *   **C**holera vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
    *   **A**nthrax vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    *   **R**abies vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
    (Note: He developed the vaccines, not necessarily identified the organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>).

## Robert Koch
Robert Koch is considered the **"Father of Modern Microbiology"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Contributions:
*   Developed **Koch's Postulates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   Identified the **Koch's Bacillus**, which is *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (tuberculosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   Identified the **cholera bacillus** (organism, *Vibrio cholerae*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. (Note: Louis Pasteur developed the cholera vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>).
*   Developed **solid culture media** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Introduced the **aniline dye** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   Developed the **hanging drop motility** testing technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Paul Ehrlich
### Contributions:
*   The **Ehrlichia organism** is named after him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   Known as the **"Father of Chemotherapy"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Received a **Nobel Prize** for standardizing the interaction of toxins and antitoxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   Originally developed the **Acid Fast Stain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. (This stain was later modified by Ziehl and Neelsen, becoming known as the [[staining_techniques_in_microbiology | ZN stain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>).

## Joseph Lister
*   Known as the **"Father of Antiseptic Surgery"** for advocating the use of antiseptics in surgical settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
*   Considered the **"Father of Microscopy"** for his work with the usual **light microscope** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Ernst Ruska
*   Developed the **electron microscope** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Edward Jenner
*   Developed the **first vaccine**, which was for smallpox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

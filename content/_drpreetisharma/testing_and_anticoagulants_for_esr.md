Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) measurement typically utilizes tricodium citrate as the anticoagulant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:09">[02:39:09]</a>.

## ESR Testing Methods and Vacutainers

ESR can be determined using three primary methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>:

1.  **Manual Methods**
    *   **Wintrobe Tube**
        *   Performed manually by a doctor or technician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:07">[02:53:07]</a>.
        *   Blood is collected in an EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetra-acetic Acid) purple vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Westergren Pipette**
        *   Also performed manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
        *   Blood is collected in a light blue vacutainer, which contains tricodium citrate as the anticoagulant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
2.  **Automated Machines**
    *   Used in advanced labs, blood is directly placed into a machine for reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
    *   Blood is collected in a black vacutainer, which also contains tricodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

The difference between the light blue and black vacutainers is the testing technique, not the anticoagulant, as both contain tricodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Other Anticoagulants and Vacutainers

*   **Sodium Fluoride and Potassium Oxalate**
    *   Found in the gray vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
    *   Used for glucose estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
    *   Potassium oxalate acts as the anticoagulant, while sodium fluoride is an additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   **Heparin**
    *   Found in the green vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
    *   Primarily used for arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) in anesthesiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

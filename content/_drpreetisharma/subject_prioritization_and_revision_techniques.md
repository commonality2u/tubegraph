The last 10 days before the FMGE exam are crucial and are considered "make or break" for students [00:02:08]. This period requires a clear plan of action, focusing on specific "do's and don'ts" to maximize preparation and manage stress [00:02:01].

## Last 10 Days Strategy: Do's and Don'ts

It's common for students not to have completed all 19 subjects [00:02:45]. The strategy for the final days focuses on efficient revision rather than starting new, comprehensive studies [00:03:04].

### Prioritizing Subjects
*   **Identify Completed vs. Leftover Subjects**: Make a list of subjects you have already completed and those that are still pending [00:02:52].
*   **Address Leftover Subjects**: Do not leave any subject untouched. Even if a major subject like Medicine, Surgery, or OBGYN is left, do not attempt to study it from main videos or even full rapid revision videos [00:03:12]. Instead, focus on shorter formats [00:03:46].
    *   **Goal**: Know at least a little bit about every subject. The aim is to be able to answer at least 50% of questions from any given subject, not to achieve PhD-level knowledge [00:03:27].
    *   **Method for Leftover Subjects**: Utilize short, focused revision. This includes:
        *   Long Rapid Revision (LRR) sessions (e.g., 3-hour sessions) [00:03:58].
        *   Crash courses from any platform or YouTube [00:04:01].
*   **Avoid New Topics in Completed Subjects**: For subjects you have already studied, avoid delving into new or rare topics. Focus on reinforcing what you already know [00:04:21].
*   **Categorize Subjects for Focused Revision**:
    *   **Short Subjects**: Allocate approximately 2.5 days for subjects like Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, Dermatology, ENT, and Ophthalmology [00:10:57].
    *   **Giant/Volatile Subjects**: These include Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM. These are considered volatile and difficult to remember [00:12:10]. No one can memorize all of them perfectly [00:29:10].
    *   **Clinical Subjects**: Medicine, Pathology, Physiology, and other remaining clinical subjects [00:13:17].

### Revision Methods
*   **Focus on LRR and Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**: For both short and volatile subjects, prioritize LRR (Long Rapid Revision) sessions and solving previous year questions and topics [00:11:17].
    *   For volatile subjects, this is the primary strategy, as there isn't time for main videos or full rapid revision [00:12:55].
*   **Utilize Notes**: If you are a fast reader, you can use your [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | rapid revision notes]] [00:11:23].
*   **Flashback Sessions**: If you are unable to open books or apps, consider watching flashback sessions (e.g., from June on PrepLadder's YouTube) that cover all 19 subjects' PYQs [00:36:01]. This is helpful when you feel nothing is understood [00:36:10].
*   **Daily Topics (OTD)**: To provide structure, daily topics of the day (OTD) for subjects like Pathology and Microbiology will be provided. These are crucial topics to revise from your notes, RR, or LRR, taking about 30 minutes [00:45:25].

## Daily Schedule and Time Management
For the last nine days, your day should be divided into four time slots [00:14:44].

1.  **Study Pattern (Theory and MCQs)**: This will take up most of your day [00:14:55].
    *   **Division**: Allocate 60% of your study time to MCQs and 40% to theory [00:20:10]. When doing MCQs, explanations provide theoretical reinforcement [00:20:25]. Theory can also be covered from LRR PDFs [00:20:29].
    *   **Study Hours**: Aim for a minimum of 12-14 productive hours of study daily, ensuring full concentration and keeping phones aside [00:18:31]. However, if you can complete your daily targets in 8-9 hours due to faster reading or prior study, that is also acceptable. The goal is to finish the work [00:32:02].
2.  **Images**: Dedicate one hour daily to image revision. At the end of the day, quickly scan through all images related to the subjects you studied that day [00:16:03]. For [[pathology_image_revision | Pathology image revision]] and other subjects, consider reviewing top 50 images of Path and Micro through recorded sessions at 2x speed [00:49:50].
3.  **Sanity Break**: Allocate 30 minutes daily for personal sanity. This time should be away from books, ideally involving outdoor activity like a light walk or talking to friends. Avoid social media if it leads to extended breaks [00:15:10].
4.  **Sleep**: Ensure a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep. Do not attempt sleepless nights or self-medication as it can lead to mental blankness during the exam [00:19:14]. Normalize your sleep cycle to be alert during morning hours, aligning with exam timings [00:04:52].

### MCQ Practice
*   **Quantity**: Aim for at least 150+ MCQs daily. Some successful students have done 300+ questions daily [00:21:12]. If you're doing 100 questions, gradually increase by 10-15 questions daily [00:34:57].
*   **Type**:
    *   **PYQs**: FMG's last five years' PYQs are mandatory [00:21:18]. After that, if time permits, review NEET PG's last three years' questions (2020, 2021, 2022) [00:26:28]. If even more time is left, consider the IAI CET exam from November (one paper) [00:27:17].
    *   **New Questions**: Do not solely rely on memorized PYQs as exam patterns change [00:22:20]. Focus on solving MCQs related to previous year *topics* (e.g., all Apoptosis MCQs from a Q-bank) rather than just memorizing old questions [00:22:31].
    *   **[[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | Custom Modules]]**: Creating custom modules from a question bank is beneficial as it acts like a mini-grand test [00:34:08].
*   **Analysis**:
    *   If an MCQ is correct, do not read the explanation. You already possess the knowledge [00:07:18].
    *   If an MCQ is incorrect, superficially read the explanation (5-10 lines) to understand if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap. If a knowledge gap, quickly review the topic [00:07:29].
    *   Do not get discouraged by "bouncer" questions (20-30 new questions in a grand test that you haven't seen before). These are designed to prevent overconfidence and do not determine your pass/fail status [00:08:03]. Your success is determined by knowing familiar topics and avoiding silly mistakes [00:08:29].

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   **Purpose**: Give GTs not to gauge your score (especially if it causes panic below 150) [00:05:21], but for [[exam_preparation_strategies | time management]] and identifying silly mistakes [00:05:58].
*   **Focus**: Prioritize finishing 300 questions within the allotted time and having time for review [00:06:25].
*   **Score**: Do not focus on crossing 150+ marks in GTs now; that is the target for the actual exam [00:08:36].

## Managing Anxiety and Mindset
*   **Positivity**: Cultivate a positive mindset. Only interact with people who provide positive vibes (parents, siblings, good friends, teachers) [00:09:14].
*   **Avoid Negativity**: Stay away from those who boast about their high scores or spread rumors about exam difficulty or pattern changes [00:09:37].
*   **Block Negative Thoughts**: Do not let negative thoughts, such as worries about forgetting material or exam day logistics (alarm, reaching center, computer issues), consume your mind [00:24:39]. One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ answer [00:24:42].
*   **Focus on the Present**: Work in small, manageable boxes (e.g., what to study in the next three hours), rather than worrying about five days later or the overall condition [00:54:18].
*   **Accept Forgetting**: It's normal to feel like you're forgetting subjects. No one can perfectly memorize all 19 subjects [00:23:44]. Instead of dwelling on it, quickly pick up and revise the forgotten topic [00:24:07].
*   **Survival Mode**: Recognize that these last days are about survival. Study subjects like Pharmacology and Microbiology with the mindset that you have to pass this one time and won't need to study them again [00:30:29].

## Exam Day Mindset
*   **Routine**: Maintain your normal routine leading up to the exam. Do not experiment with new medications or drastic changes [00:19:53].
*   **Paper Strategy**: Expect one paper to be tough and the other to be easy [00:40:45].
    *   **During Break**: If Paper 1 is tough, do not discuss it during the break. Disconnect from it and focus on Paper 2. Do not carry the backlog or hangover of Paper 1 into Paper 2 [00:40:19].
    *   **Overall Goal**: The goal is to combine scores from both papers to cross 150 [00:41:27].
*   **Sustained Focus**: Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch without breaks, distractions, or your phone. This builds the mental stamina required for the actual exam where you need to maintain alertness and attention for prolonged periods [00:53:05].

Remember, your success is a combination of knowledge and mindset. Stay mentally stable and avoid getting into a negative cycle [00:24:21].

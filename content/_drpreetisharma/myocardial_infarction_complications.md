Myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized by coagulative necrosis of myocardial tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. After an MI, the body attempts to repair itself by forming granulation tissue, which begins around the seventh day post-MI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

## Complications of Myocardial Infarction

### Timing of Complications

Different complications of MI occur at specific time points:

*   **3 to 7 days post-MI**: The most likely complication is rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, which can involve the ventricular wall, papillary muscle, or interventricular septum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Rupture occurs before the body enters a full scarring or fighting mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **19 to 21 days (around 3 weeks) post-MI**: Autoimmune pericarditis, also known as Dressler's Syndrome, is a late complication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. This occurs as the body develops antibodies, which takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

### Reperfusion Injury

Reperfusion injury can occur when blood flow is restored to an area of the heart that was previously blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.

*   **Mechanism**: During the blockage, free radicals, calcium, and inflammatory cells accumulate in the affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. When blood supply is restored, these substances rush into the heart, causing damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Pathological Findings**: Reperfusion injury can lead to contraction band necrosis, characterized by numerous bands formed within the cardiac muscle fibers due to excessive calcium-induced contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.

### Diagnostic Stains for MI

*   **Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) Stain**:
    *   **Principle**: TTC stains lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>, particularly LDH-1, which is abundant in the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.
    *   **Colors**:
        *   Normal, viable heart tissue stains brick red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.
        *   Infarcted (dead) tissue, where LDH is depleted, stains pale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
    *   **Utility**: This stain is useful for identifying MI within the first four hours, as visible color changes in the heart are not apparent to the naked eye during this early period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. After four hours, the infarcted area darkens and becomes evident without staining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

### Sarcoidosis vs. Tuberculosis (TB) Granulomas

Both sarcoidosis and tuberculosis involve granuloma formation, but they have distinct features. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis is usually made by exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>.

*   **Tuberculosis (TB)**:
    *   Symptoms: Chest discomfort, night sweats, fever, cough, lymphadenopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.
    *   Histology: Granulomas with a lymphocitic collar (a ring of blue-colored lymphocytes surrounding the granuloma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>. Caseous necrosis is more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.
*   **Sarcoidosis**:
    *   Histology: Naked granulomas (lacking a lymphocytic collar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. Non-caseating granulomas are more common, but caseating granulomas can also be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.
    *   Associated findings: Increased calcium levels, increased Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) levels, increased CD4/CD8 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.
    *   Bodies: Asteroid bodies (star-shaped, intracellular) and Schaumann bodies (round, calcium-containing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.
        *   Note: Asteroid bodies are also seen extracellularly in sporothrix (Rose Gardener's Disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>.

### Occupational Lung Diseases

*   **Silicosis**:
    *   Caused by inhalation of silica crystals, common in the glass industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>.
    *   Increases risk of TB and lung cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
    *   Radiology: Egg-shell calcifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **Asbestosis**:
    *   Characterized by asbestos bodies (also called ferruginous bodies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
    *   Appearance: Dumbbell-shaped structures that are brown due to inhaled asbestos fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. They can stain blue with Prussian blue due to iron deposition around the inhaled particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.
    *   Important distinction: All asbestos bodies are ferruginous bodies (because they have iron deposited), but not all ferruginous bodies are asbestos bodies (as they can form around other inhaled particles like silica or coal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.

### Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency

*   An autosomal recessive disorder primarily affecting children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   Genetic: Mutation on chromosome 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.

*   **Liver**: Can cause cirrhosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>, characterized by pink-colored, PAS-positive, diastase-resistant droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

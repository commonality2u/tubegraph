The NEET PG 2025 exam date remains uncertain, with past experiences indicating potential postponements and unannounced changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Given this unpredictability, the most effective approach is to create a flexible study plan and adapt as dates become clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is not advisable to wait for a confirmed date, as it might be announced too close to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Recommended Study Plan

A 65-day plan is suggested as a baseline, suitable for both those who have taken a drop after NEET PG 2024 and those currently in their internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Interns may need to add 2-3 extra days for long subjects and 1 day for short subjects to accommodate their schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Daily Schedule Components

*   **Morning MCQs:** Dedicate 1 hour every morning to solving custom module MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Initially, focus on subjects already completed, then gradually include more subjects as they are covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This can be a 50-question "mini Grand Test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Daily Medicine Study:** Incorporate 1 to 1.5 hours of Medicine study daily, ideally at a fixed time like 10 PM, treating it as a "clinical posting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This approach helps integrate topics and manages the vastness of the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. If daily study is challenging, allocate separate days for Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   **Consistency and Discipline:** Adhering to the timetable with discipline is crucial; constantly changing the timetable is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Recommended Subject-wise Time Allocation (65-Day Plan)

This plan balances subjects, incorporating occasional Grand Tests (GTs). For those feeling less comfortable with the syllabus, 3 GTs in 65 days is a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. More frequent GTs (every 15 days or weekly) are beneficial for those in a comfortable position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

*   Anatomy: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. (If Anatomy is challenging, study it alongside Allied subjects like Orthopedics, Surgery, and Radiology for repeated exposure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   Biochemistry: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   ENT: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   Pathology: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. (Focus on Rapid Revision videos (~20 hours) for efficiency. Stick to RR 5.0 if previously viewed; otherwise, use RR 6.0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   Microbiology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. (Rapid Revision videos are roughly 15 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   Other Short Subjects (e.g., Derma, Anesthesia, Radiology): 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   PSM: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   Surgery: 6 days (includes GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   OBGY: 6 days (for first read) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   Ophthalmology (Ophal): 3 days (acknowledging neuro-ophthalmology difficulty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   Pharmacology (Pharma): 5 days (4 days for subject, 1 for GT/Analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   Physiology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. (It is recommended to study Physiology towards the end, as it consolidates concepts from other subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Study Resources and Techniques

*   **Volatile Topics Notebook:** Maintain a separate notebook (sometimes called "20th notebook" or "Chy copy") listing only the names of volatile topics and Grand Test mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This notebook should be personal, reflecting individual weak areas, not a bulky re-write of notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. It should contain topics to revisit from rapid revision videos or specific concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Study Approach:**
    *   For first-time exam takers or interns, a subject-wise study approach is recommended to avoid missing general sections of subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Surgery, and Biochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   For those on their second, third, or fourth revision, a system-wise approach can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Revisions:** The first revision should be comprehensive ("full") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Subsequent revisions should narrow down to rapid revision videos and then filtered volatile topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Video Usage:** Watch videos for initial understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. For subsequent revisions, rely on notes and active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. Re-watch videos only for specific topics that are difficult to understand from notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. For those starting from scratch, begin with rapid revision and refer to main videos only for confusing topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision (RR) and Main Videos:** For subjects like Pathology and Microbiology, Rapid Revision videos are often sufficient to cover 85-90% of the QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The content in RR is consolidated from main videos, making it faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. For working doctors, rapid revision videos are essential due to limited study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Question Banks:** If doing a first full read, use the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. If one revision is already completed, the custom module in the morning should include questions from all subjects, acting as a mini Grand Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

*   **Purpose:** GTs serve as a guide to identify weak areas and track progress, not just to focus on the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **Analysis over Score:** After a GT, analyze incorrect answers, then confused guesses, and finally correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Focus on *why* questions were missed (factual errors, clinical reasoning, time management, recall issues) rather than just the raw score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Improving GT Scores:**
    *   If pathology questions are wrong, analyze specific topics to strengthen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
    *   If factual questions are missed, strengthen first and second-year subjects (e.g., Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
    *   If clinical questions are missed, practice more medicine and surgery MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
    *   If there's a problem with recall, revise notes more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
    *   If time management is an issue, practice solving MCQs with a timer (aim for 42-45 seconds per question) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.
    *   Increase the number of questions solved daily (e.g., from 40 to 60 or 80) if McQ management is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Fear of GTs:** To overcome the fear of GTs, repeatedly take them and embrace mistakes as learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. Alternatively, start with custom modules of mixed questions on a timer, only attempting a full GT once comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. Do not label initial practice sessions as "Grand Tests" if the label causes anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

## Additional Advice

*   **Prioritize Health:** Physical and mental health are paramount. Address any health issues before focusing intensely on the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Avoid mental exhaustion early in the preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Minimize Sources:** Stick to notes and a single QBank for core study. Avoid constantly switching platforms or notes, as most content is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. Free Grand Tests from different platforms are useful as they offer varied question sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
*   **Start Now:** Begin studying immediately, even if it's just decluttering the study space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

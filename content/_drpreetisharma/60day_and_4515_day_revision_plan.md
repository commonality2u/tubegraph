Dr. Preeti Sharma outlines a comprehensive [[exam_preparation_strategies | plan and strategy]] for students preparing for the [[fmge_december_2024_exam_preparation_strategy | upcoming December 2024 FMGE exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This strategy is applicable for both first-time test-takers and those who did not achieve the 150 score in the June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Overall Plan Overview

The strategy is divided into two main phases:
1.  **60-Day Timetable**: Focused on completing the syllabus with theory and practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This phase runs from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  **Revision Plan**: A post-syllabus completion phase divided into three revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   Revision 1: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    *   Revision 2: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
    *   Revision 3: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
    This sequence aims to cover preparation roughly until December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The exact revision plan can be adjusted once the exam date is finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The 60-Day Timetable (July 24th - September 21st)

The 60-day plan emphasizes both theory and MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Daily Targets
*   **MCQs**: Aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If you're new to practicing MCQs, gradually increase your daily count by 15-20 until you reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Study Hours**: Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is crucial for completing the syllabus within 60 days, which is necessary for the subsequent three revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Key Principles for Success
The key to cracking this exam is the number of [[importance_of_revision_and_mcq_practice | revisions and MCQs]] practiced daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Single Source**: Use a single source per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Customize your sources (faculty, notes) based on what you understand best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Video Strategy**:
    *   For strong subjects (where you score >80% in Q-bank), refer to [[choosing_between_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_for_different_subjects | rapid revision videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   For weaker subjects/topics (where you score <80% in Q-bank), use main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   **Specific Recommendations**: For Pathology and Microbiology, use [[role_of_rapid_revision_in_fmge_success | rapid revision videos]] only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. (Pathology RR is ~19 hours, Microbiology RR is ~16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, aiming for ~5 hours of video lectures per day at 1.5x-2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>).

### Subject Prioritization and Integration
The subjects are divided into four integrated blocks to facilitate understanding and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

#### Block 1
*   Anatomy: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
*   Radiology: 2 days (integrated with surgery/ortho for X-rays, CT scans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

#### Block 2
*   Pathology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   Microbiology: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   Pharmacology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> (These basic sciences strengthen Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   Medicine: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 2 days (overlaps with Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   Physiology: 1 day (focused on extra physiologies if covered in Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
*   Dermatology: 1 day (correlates with Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

#### Block 3
*   PSM: 5 days (given extra time due to increasing difficulty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
*   ENT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   Ophthalmology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
*   OBGY: 6 days (must) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   Anesthesia: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>
*   FMT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>

#### Grand Tests (GTs)
Two Grand Tests (GTs) are integrated into the 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>:
*   GT 1: September 8th (after ~15 subjects completed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
*   GT 2: September 21st (at the end of the 60 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>
Each GT requires an entire day for taking the test and reviewing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Mindset for the 60 Days
Focus entirely on the present 60-day plan, from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
> "No past guilt, no future anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Daily Study Structure: "Timeboxing"

This structured approach helps manage time and avoid burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

*   **Morning Routine (1 hour)**: Enjoy your morning, ideally with 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM, 3 hours)**: Mimic exam conditions by sitting for a long stretch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Short Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM, 30 minutes)**: Relax without social media or digital screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Close eyes, listen to music, talk with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM, 2.5 hours)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM, 1.5 hours)**: Lunch (30 mins) plus an hour to relax, power nap, or use social media/watch something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM, 2.5 hours)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Long Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM, 1 hour)**: Mix relaxation with social interaction/media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM, 2 hours)**: The shortest session as you're getting tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Evening Routine (9:00 PM onwards)**:
    *   **[[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | Custom module]] Practice (30 questions)**: Lie down casually and do a mixed bag of questions from subjects completed so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This helps stay in touch with past subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
    *   Chill time: Watch social media, web series (20 mins/day), etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Aim to sleep by 11:00 PM - 11:30 PM for 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This schedule provides 10 hours of study with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## Final Encouragement
The journey is tough, but remember:
> "This two Shall Pass... It might pass like a kidney stone, it might create a lot of pain for you... but remember nothing remains constant it will pass and better days will come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
Embrace the tough times with humility, as they will make you humble and lead to greater heights in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Your clinical skills and humility will matter in the long run more than the number of attempts to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

This article focuses on the identification of various thyroid abnormalities, including goiters, inflammatory conditions, and cancers, along with the diagnostic tools and histological findings associated with them.

## Thyroid Anatomy and Basic Histology
The thyroid gland is located in the anterior portion of the neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:40">[05:01:40]</a>. Normal thyroid histology shows follicles containing pink colloid material, lined by follicular epithelial cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Parafollicular C cells are also present, which are clusters of cells distinct from the follicles and do not contain colloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

## Thyroid Abnormalities and Conditions

### Non-Toxic Goiter
A non-toxic goiter presents as a symmetrically enlarged thyroid gland, typically without symptoms of hyper- or hypothyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Patients might experience discomfort during swallowing due to the swelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

### Graves' Disease (Hyperthyroidism)
Graves' disease is a condition characterized by hyperthyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Patients often present with symptoms like nervousness, muscle weakness, heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss, dyspnea, heart palpitations, and menstrual irregularities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Physical examination may reveal warm, moist skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition associated with anti-TSH receptor antibodies (also known as thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins or TSI), which stimulate the thyroid gland to produce excess T3 and T4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Historically, these antibodies were called long-acting thyroid stimulators (LATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This condition is categorized as a Type II hypersensitivity reaction, and more recently, is being placed under Type V hypersensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

Histological findings in Graves' disease include:
*   **Follicular hyperplasia with scalloping of colloid:** The thyroid follicles show increased activity and proliferation, and the colloid within them appears "scooped out" or "eaten away" at the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This gives the gross specimen a "beefy red" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Pseudo papillae:** Due to hyperplasia, the cells can form finger-like projections lacking a fibrovascular core, differentiating them from true papillae seen in papillary carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

### Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (Hypothyroidism)
Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an inflammatory condition that leads to hypothyroidism due to the destruction of the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. It is characterized by diffuse enlargement of the thyroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

Histological findings include:
*   **Dense lymphoid infiltrates with germinal centers:** The thyroid tissue is heavily infiltrated by lymphocytes, forming structures resembling lymph nodes with active germinal centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Hürthle cells (Aškanazy cells):** Thyroid cells undergo metaplasia and become large, eosinophilic cells with abundant granular cytoplasm. These cells are known as Hürthle cells, though they were originally accurately described by Aškanazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   Hashimoto's thyroiditis can precede the development of [[pathology_and_characteristics_of_different_thyroid_cancers | papillary thyroid carcinoma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Thyroid Tumors and Cancers
Cancers of the thyroid, such as papillary, follicular, and anaplastic carcinomas, originate from follicular cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. Medullary thyroid cancer arises from parafollicular C cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

### Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has an excellent prognosis, with nearly 100% survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. It is the most common thyroid cancer associated with radiation exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Key [[visual_and_histological_pathology_clues_for_diagnosis | histological]] features:
*   **True papillae:** These are finger-like projections with a fibrovascular core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Psammoma bodies:** These are random blue, calcified structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **Orphan Annie eye nuclei:** These are optically clear or "white" nuclei, an artifact due to formalin fixation, and are thus seen on biopsy but not on FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (INCI):** Cytoplasm invaginating into the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Intranuclear grooves (coffee bean nuclei):** A linear groove or indentation in the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

Genetic alterations include BRAF V600E mutation (most common) and RET/PTC fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

### [[follicular_adenoma_and_its_clinical_aspects | Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma]]
Patients with [[follicular_adenoma_and_its_clinical_aspects | follicular adenoma]] typically present with a small, encapsulated nodule, unlike the diffuse enlargement seen in inflammatory conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

Genetic alterations in follicular carcinoma include RAS mutations (most common) and mutations in genes like PTEN, PI3K, and PAX8-PPARγ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

### Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
This cancer arises from parafollicular C cells, which produce calcitonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. Therefore, calcitonin is a key tumor marker for medullary thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

Histologically, it often presents with amyloid deposits, which appear as pink material and can be confirmed with Congo Red stain, showing apple-green birefringence under a polarizing microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Genetically, medullary thyroid carcinoma is associated with RET gene mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. The mnemonic "RET 10 MEN" helps remember that the RET gene mutation is on chromosome 10 and is associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes (MEN 2A, 2B, and MEN 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. It's important to distinguish RET mutation (medullary thyroid cancer) from RET/PTC fusion (papillary thyroid carcinoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Loss of function of the RET gene can lead to Hirschsprung's disease, where ganglion cells fail to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma has the worst prognosis among thyroid cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Diagnostic Procedures and Findings

### Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)
FNAC is a common procedure for thyroid nodule evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
*   **Adequacy Criteria:** For an FNAC to be considered adequate by a pathologist, it typically requires at least six follicles, with each follicle containing a minimum of 10 cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   **Exceptions to Adequacy:** The report can still be given even if adequacy criteria are not met in specific cases:
    *   Presence of malignant cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
    *   Colloid goiter (where mostly fluid/colloid is aspirated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
    *   Inflammation (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
*   **Chewing Gum Colloid:** On FNAC, the thick colloid from papillary thyroid carcinoma can appear stretched and "chewing gum-like" due to aspiration through a thin needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   The Bethesda System is a classification system used for reporting thyroid FNAC results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### Biopsy and Histology
Biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. [[pathology_image_identification | Histological]] examination of biopsies provides definitive [[visual_and_histological_pathology_clues_for_diagnosis | diagnostic clues]].

### Imaging (CT Scan)
A stellate scar, which appears as a non-enhancing central area, can be seen on a CT scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. While not specific to the thyroid, it's mentioned as a general imaging finding. In the context of [[renal_tumor_diagnosis_and_histology | renal tumor diagnosis and histology]], it's seen in oncocytoma and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. In the liver, it can be seen in focal nodular hyperplasia and fibrolamellar HCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. In the pancreas, it's associated with serous cystadenocarcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. In the breast, a radial scar also has a central stellate scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
IHC uses antibodies to detect specific proteins in tissue samples, with positive staining often appearing brown due to diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. In breast cancer, IHC is used to score HER2/neu expression (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. A 3+ score indicates HER2 amplification and warrants trastuzumab treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
FISH is used when IHC results are equivocal (2+ for HER2/neu) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. It detects gene amplification by counting gene signals (e.g., HER2/neu in red) relative to chromosome centromere signals (e.g., chromosome 17 in green) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. A HER2/neu to chromosome 17 ratio greater than 2.2 indicates gene amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

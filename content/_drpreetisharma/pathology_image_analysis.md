This article compiles [[Visual and histological pathology clues for diagnosis | visual and histological pathology clues for diagnosis]] for various conditions, emphasizing [[Pathology Image Identification | image identification]] as a crucial component for [[Diagnostics in pathology and microbiology | diagnostics in pathology and microbiology]]. The session focuses on revising images, particularly for an upcoming FMG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## General Image Analysis Principles

The session aims to cover a broad range of important images, with approximately 50 images for pathology and 50 for microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The approach involves quickly identifying key features in images and recalling associated theoretical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

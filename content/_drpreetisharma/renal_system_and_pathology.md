## Introduction to Renal and Genital System Pathology
This session focuses on key aspects of [[kidney_pathology | renal pathology]] and [[genital_system_and_pathology | genital system pathology]] [00:00:30]. Daily quizzes on these topics are also conducted [00:00:49].

## Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
[[renal_cell_carcinoma_diagnosis_and_pathology | Renal Cell Carcinoma]] (RCC) is a significant focus in renal pathology. Common presenting symptoms include right flank pain and hematuria [00:01:37].

### Types of Renal Cell Carcinoma
#### 1. Clear Cell RCC (CCC)
*   **Most Common:** Clear cell RCC is the most frequently encountered type [00:05:04].
*   **Histology:** Characterized by "empty clear cells" [00:05:09], which appear white and clear under microscopy [00:05:51].
*   **Genetics:** Associated with the deletion of chromosome 3p [00:05:15].
*   **Syndrome:** Linked to [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome]] [00:05:22].

#### 2. Papillary RCC
*   **Histology:** Features include tall cells arranged in papillae [00:01:57] and the presence of psammoma bodies [00:06:17], which are seen in many papillary tumors throughout the body (e.g., thyroid, breast, kidney) [00:06:11].
*   **Genetics:** Commonly associated with Trisomy 7 and 17 [00:02:48]. It can also involve loss of the Y chromosome [00:07:08].
*   **Risk Factors:** Patients undergoing dialysis are at increased risk [00:06:51].
*   **Syndrome:** Fumarate hydratase (FH) gene mutation leads to Papillary RCC and Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Carcinoma (HLRCC), which is also characterized by multiple leiomyomas (fibroids) [00:07:56]. The presence of leiomyomatosis distinguishes FH gene mutation from other papillary RCCs [00:08:46].

#### 3. Chromophobe RCC
*   **Genetics:** Known for multiple chromosomal losses, often described as "running away from chromosomes" [00:10:40]. Specific losses can include chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 10, and 13 [00:10:46].
*   **Syndrome:** Associated with Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome [00:11:08], which can also present with fibrofolliculomas (a skin appendage tumor) [00:11:31].
*   **Histology:** Exhibits "plant cells" appearance with distinct cell outlines, a dark "raisinoid nucleus," and a "perinuclear halo" (empty area around the nucleus) [00:12:23].
*   **Staining:** Stains positively with Hale's colloidal iron [00:13:36].

#### 4. Bellini Duct / Collecting Duct RCC
*   This type has the worst prognosis among RCCs [00:14:20].
*   It is also known as collecting duct carcinoma [00:14:51].

#### 5. Medullary RCC
*   **Association:** Strongly associated with sickle cell trait, not sickle cell anemia [00:15:16].
*   **Diagnosis:** Requires specific hematology reports, showing a sickle cell trait (e.g., HbAS) [00:16:43].

#### 6. Pediatric RCC (Xp11 Translocation RCC)
*   **Gene:** Involves the TFE3 gene [00:15:48].
*   **Chromosome:** Located on the X chromosome [00:15:48].
*   While often associated with childhood cancer, it can also occur in older patients [00:04:03]. It is distinct from Wilms Tumor, which is associated with WT1 on chromosome 11 [00:17:36].

## Other Renal Tumors
### Angiomyolipoma (AML)
*   **Association:** Linked to [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | tuberous sclerosis]] [00:17:46], a condition also associated with cardiac rhabdomyoma (which shows spider cells) [00:18:57].
*   **Composition:** Composed of blood vessels (angio), muscle (myo), and fat (lipo) [00:18:37].

### Renal Oncocytoma
*   **Nature:** A benign tumor of the kidney [00:20:18].
*   **Histology:** Cells are rich in mitochondria [00:20:28].
*   **Gross Appearance:** Classically described as having a mahogany brown color [00:21:04].
*   **Key Feature:** Often exhibits a central stellate scar [00:21:12].

## Urinary Bladder Carcinoma
*   **Schistosomiasis (Cystocele):** Most commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder [00:22:52]. It can also cause transitional cell carcinoma, but squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent in this context [00:23:00].

## [[diabetic_nephropathy_and_related_renal_pathology | Diabetic Nephropathy]]
A case of uncontrolled diabetes with proteinuria, glycosuria, and casts in urine indicates kidney failure [00:24:24].
### Features of [[diabetic_nephropathy_pathology | Diabetic Nephropathy]]
The mnemonic "DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY" helps remember the features:
*   **D**ense: Diffuse glomerular sclerosis [00:29:39].
*   **I**ntracapillary: Thickening of capillaries [00:28:22].
*   **A**rteriolosclerosis: Hyaline arteriolosclerosis [00:28:44].
*   **B**randed name: Armani-Ebstein lesion (glycogen deposits in proximal convoluted tubule - PCT) [00:29:06].
*   **E**nd caps: Drop end cap, also known as Capsular Drop (pink material dropping from Bowman's capsule) [00:29:54] and Fiebig (ring-like pink dots on capillaries) [00:30:30].
*   **T**ransitional: (Not explicitly covered in mnemonic explanation in transcript, but assumed from context of [[diabetic_nephropathy_and_related_renal_pathology | Diabetic Nephropathy]] terms).
*   **I**ncreased: (Not explicitly covered in mnemonic explanation).
*   **C**apsular: Capsular drop [00:30:09].
*   **N**odular: Nodular glomerular sclerosis, also known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson (KW) lesion [00:25:01]. These nodules appear pink and are PAS-positive [00:25:57].
*   **E**pithelial: (Not explicitly covered in mnemonic explanation).
*   **P**apillary Necrosis: [[kidney_pathology | Renal papillary necrosis]] [00:31:16].
*   **H**yaline: Hyaline arteriolosclerosis [00:28:44].
*   **R**upture: (Not explicitly covered in mnemonic explanation).
*   **O**liguria: (Not explicitly covered in mnemonic explanation).
*   **P**odocyte: (Not explicitly covered in mnemonic explanation).
*   **A**zotemia: (Not explicitly covered in mnemonic explanation).
*   **T**ubular: (Not explicitly covered in mnemonic explanation).
*   **H**ypertension: (Not explicitly covered in mnemonic explanation).
*   **Y**ellowish: (Not explicitly covered in mnemonic explanation).

Actual changes in diabetes involve glycosylation of proteins leading to lesion formation [00:26:42].

### Causes of Papillary Necrosis
The main causes of [[kidney_pathology | renal papillary necrosis]] are [00:32:35]:
1.  Diabetes [00:32:50]
2.  Obstruction (obstructive disorders) [00:32:54]
3.  Sickle cell anemia [00:33:00]
4.  Analgesic abuse (e.g., phenacetin) [00:33:09]

## Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
RPGN is characterized by rapid progression and typically presents as a nephritic syndrome [00:35:14].
### Clinical Features of Nephritic Syndrome (HOHA)
*   **H**ematuria [00:35:33]
*   **O**liguria (urine output less than 400ml/24 hours) [00:35:40]
*   **H**ypertension [00:35:58]
*   **A**zotemia (increased blood urea nitrogen - BUN) [00:36:03]

### Histological Features of RPGN
*   **Crescents:** The hallmark of RPGN is the formation of crescents [00:35:00], which appear as "half-moon flaps" within the glomerulus [00:37:26].
*   **Crescent Composition:** Crescents are primarily composed of parietal epithelial cells [00:38:07], but may also contain visceral epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages [00:38:36].
*   **Electron Microscopy (EM):** EM reveals rupture and wrinkling of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) [00:39:41].

## Kidney Pathology: Immunofluorescence and Electron Microscopy
A systematic approach to understanding different glomerular diseases based on the location of immune complex deposits is crucial [00:41:42].
*   **Podocyte (Sub-epithelial):** Deposits "below the feet" (podocytes) [00:42:37].
    *   **Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN):** Occurs in children [00:42:58], characterized by "starry sky appearance" on immunofluorescence and sub-epithelial "humps" on EM [00:47:37].
    *   **Membranous Glomerulonephropathy (MGN):** Occurs in elderly individuals [00:43:09], characterized by "spike and dome" pattern on silver stain (GMS stain makes GBM black) and sub-epithelial deposits on EM [00:56:07]. The "domes" represent immune complexes [00:57:03].
*   **Mesangium (Middle):** Deposits in the mesangial area [00:43:40].
    *   **Berger's Disease (IgA Nephropathy):** Characterized by IgA deposits in the mesangium [00:44:01], which appear as green deposition in the "middle" on immunofluorescence [00:50:06].
*   **Intramembranous (Basement Membrane):** Deposits within the basement membrane [00:44:20].
    *   **Dense Deposit Disease (DDD) / MPGN Type 2:** The entire basement membrane appears densely black on EM due to deposits [00:44:38].
*   **Sub-endothelial (Below Endothelium):** Deposits below the endothelial cells lining the capillaries [00:45:05].
    *   **MPGN Type 1:** Presents with a "tram track appearance" (double-layered basement membrane) on light microscopy [00:59:12].
    *   **Lupus Nephritis (SLE):** Can present with "wire loop lesions" on light microscopy, especially in Class IV lupus nephritis [00:46:39].

### Other Notable Glomerular Diseases
*   **Alport Syndrome:**
    *   **Histology:** EM reveals a "basket weave appearance" of the basement membrane due to thinning and thickening [00:52:39].
    *   **Genetics:** Primarily caused by a defect in the Alpha-5 chain of Collagen Type IV [00:53:57], though Alpha-3 and Alpha-4 chains can also be involved [00:54:03].
    *   **Systemic Manifestations:** A multi-system disorder affecting kidneys (nephritic syndrome) [00:53:01], eyes (anterior lenticonus) [00:53:11], and ears (sensory neural hearing loss) [00:53:09].
*   **Minimal Change Disease:**
    *   **Histology:** Characterized by "effacement of foot processes" (podocytes appear flattened) on EM [00:54:56]. This is a type of nephrotic syndrome [00:55:00].

## Ovarian Tumors

### Surface Epithelial Tumors
These are the most common type of ovarian tumors [01:05:35]. A tumor marker for surface epithelial tumors is CA125 [01:07:25].
#### 1. Serous Cystadenoma
*   **Appearance:** Uniloculated cyst [01:03:08].
*   **Fluid:** Contains clear, watery (serous) fluid [01:01:57].
*   **Histology:** Shows ciliated epithelium [01:04:34] and psammoma bodies [01:03:01].

#### 2. Mucinous Cystadenoma
*   **Appearance:** Multiloculated cyst [01:03:28].
*   **Fluid:** Contains thick, gelatinous mucin [01:03:34].
*   **Histology:** Contains mucin-producing (empty) cells [01:04:41].

#### 3. Brenner Tumor
*   **Histology:** Composed of nests of cells resembling transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder [01:08:50].
*   **Key Feature:** Often shows "coffee bean nuclei" (nuclei with a longitudinal groove) [01:06:37].
*   **Association:** In 25% of cases, Brenner tumors are associated with mucinous tumors [01:09:07].
*   **Walthard Cell Rest:** A normal finding, not a disease. These are embryonic remnants of transitional epithelium found in miscellaneous sites like the fallopian tube or ovary [01:08:10].

### Sex Cord-Stromal Tumors
#### 1. Granulosa Cell Tumor
*   **Demographics:** Commonly seen in post-menopausal women [01:10:29].
*   **Hormonal Activity:** Often produces estrogen, leading to hyperestrogenic symptoms such as post-menopausal bleeding and a bulky uterus [01:10:57].
*   **Histology:** Characterized by Call-Exner bodies, which are small follicles with eosinophilic fluid surrounded by granulosa cells [01:11:58]. Coffee bean nuclei (nuclear grooves) are also seen [01:12:06].
*   **Immunohistochemistry:** CD99 positive [01:12:06].
*   **Genetics:** Associated with FOXL2 gene mutation [01:13:31].
*   **Tumor Marker:** Inhibin [01:12:38].

#### 2. Leydig Cell Tumor
*   **Key Feature:** Contains Reinke crystalloids [01:14:18].

### Germ Cell Tumors
#### 1. Yolk Sac Tumor
*   **Tumor Marker:** Elevated Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) [01:19:01].

#### 2. Dysgerminoma
*   **Similar to:** Seminoma [01:19:11].
*   **Tumor Markers:** Elevated Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and Placental Alkaline Phosphatase (PLAP) [01:19:14].

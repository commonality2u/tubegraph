Microscopes are fundamental tools in microbiology labs, allowing for the visualization and identification of microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00"></a>. Understanding their components and principles is crucial for students in fields like FMG, NEET PG, and NEXT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09"></a>.

## Light Microscope
The light microscope is a common type of microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10"></a>. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is known as the father of [[microscope_types_and_their_principles | microscopy]] for his contributions to the light microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00"></a>.

### Principles and Components
*   **Light Source:** Utilizes transmitted light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00"></a>. The light originates from a bulb that transmits light upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00"></a>.
*   **Condenser:** Located below the stage, it focuses light rays onto the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00"></a>.
*   **Iris:** Fitted inside the condenser, it regulates the amount of light passing through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00"></a>.
*   **Stage:** The flat platform where the glass slide specimen is placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00"></a>.
*   **Adjustment Knobs:**
    *   **Coarse Adjustment:** The big knob used for initial focusing and larger movements of the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00"></a>.
    *   **Fine Adjustment:** The small knob used for precise focusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00"></a>.
*   **Eyepiece Lens (Ocular Lens):** Where the observer looks through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00"></a>. It typically has a magnification of 10x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00"></a>.
*   **Objective Lenses:** A set of lenses located near the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00"></a>. These come in various magnifications:
    *   **Scanner:** 4x magnification, used for initial scanning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00"></a>.
    *   **Low Power:** 10x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00"></a>.
    *   **High Power:** 40x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00"></a>.
    *   **Oil Immersion:** 100x magnification, used with oil for clearer viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00"></a>.

### Total Magnification
The total magnification is calculated by multiplying the eyepiece lens magnification by the objective lens magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00"></a>.
*   Scanner: 4x (objective) * 10x (eyepiece) = 40x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00"></a>.
*   Low Power: 10x (objective) * 10x (eyepiece) = 100x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00"></a>.
*   High Power: 40x (objective) * 10x (eyepiece) = 400x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00"></a>.
*   Oil Immersion: 100x (objective) * 10x (eyepiece) = 1000x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00"></a>.
The maximum magnification obtainable in a light microscope is 1000x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00"></a>.

## Dark Field Microscope
*   **Light Source:** Uses reflected light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00"></a>.
*   **Appearance:** The background appears very dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00"></a>.
*   **Use:** Ideal for visualizing very thin structures like spirochetes or flagella of bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00"></a>.

## [[Fluorescent microscopy and stains | Fluorescent Microscope]]
*   **Light Source:** Uses ultraviolet (UV) light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00"></a>.
*   **Principle:** When UV light comes into contact with a fluorescent dye, shorter wavelengths change to longer wavelengths, producing a glowing effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00"></a>.
*   **Common Fluorescent Dyes (Stains):**
    *   **Auramine and Rhodamine:** Used for suspected tuberculosis (TB) in sputum samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00"></a>.
    *   **Acridine Orange:** Used for suspected malaria cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00"></a>.
    *   **Calcofluor White:** Used for fungal detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00"></a>.
*   **Image Appearance:** Organisms appear with a fluorescent color against a dark background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00"></a>.

## Electron Microscope (EM)
*   Ernst Ruska discovered the electron microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00"></a>.
*   **Appearance:** Looks like a closed space shuttle because it requires a vacuum environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00"></a>.
*   **Light Source:** Uses a beam of electrons instead of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00"></a>.
*   **Specimen Slide:** Requires a metal slide, typically made of copper, as electrons cannot be used on glass slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00"></a>.
*   **Fixatives:**
    *   For light microscopy, a tissue sample is fixed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00"></a>.
    *   For electron microscopy, a tissue sample is fixed in 2-2.5% Glutaraldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00"></a>.

## [[Microscopy and image identification techniques | Microscopy and Image Identification Techniques]]
[[Microbiology image recognition | Image identification]] is a key skill in microbiology, and microscopes are central to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00"></a>. Different [[Microscope types and their principles | microscope types]] and stains are used to differentiate and recognize various microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00"></a>. For example, the appearance of bacilli under a [[Fluorescent microscopy and stains | fluorescent microscope]] can indicate tuberculosis if [[Fluorescent microscopy and stains | auramine and rhodamine]] stains were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00"></a>. Similarly, different stains produce specific color outcomes for [[pathology_and_microbiology_mcqs | microbial identification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00"></a>.

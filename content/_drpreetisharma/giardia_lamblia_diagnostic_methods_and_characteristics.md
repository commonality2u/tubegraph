## Associated Immunoglobulins
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is associated with [[identifying_giardia_lamblia_with_string_test | Giardia lamblia]] infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. IgA is considered a mucosal antibody, present in the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa and respiratory mucosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. It acts as the first line of defense against pathogens consumed through food or inhaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

## Diagnostic Methods

### String Test (Entero-Test)
The string test, also known as the Entero-Test, is a method used for diagnosing [[identifying_giardia_lamblia_with_string_test | Giardia lamblia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. This test helps in identifying [[pathogen_identification_and_characteristics | Giardia lamblia]] by retrieving duodenal contents for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

The procedure involves the patient ingesting a capsule containing a string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. The capsule travels down to the duodenum, and after some time, the string is pulled out, carrying duodenal samples for examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

## Morphology and Motility
[[pathogen_identification_and_characteristics | Giardia lamblia]] is colloquially referred to as the "Angry Old Man of the Intestine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.
Its trophozoite form has:
*   Two nuclei, resembling two eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
*   Four pairs of flagella, totaling eight flagella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

In pathology, the side view of [[pathogen_identification_and_characteristics | Giardia lamblia]] trophozoites in duodenal biopsies can resemble a sickle or a spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. These trophozoites are known to roam around in the lumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

A characteristic motility observed in [[pathogen_identification_and_characteristics | Giardia lamblia]] is the "falling leaf motility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. This unique movement can be a guiding light for identification even if images are unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

## Cyst Characteristics
The cyst form of [[pathogen_identification_and_characteristics | Giardia lamblia]] typically contains four nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

## Treatment
The primary drug of choice for [[identifying_giardia_lamblia_with_string_test | Giardia lamblia]] infection is Metronidazole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. While Tinidazole (2 grams daily) is also an option, Metronidazole is the commonly marked answer in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.

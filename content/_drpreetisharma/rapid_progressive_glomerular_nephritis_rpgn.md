Rapid Progressive Glomerular Nephritis (RPGN) is a serious renal condition characterized by rapid progression [00:36:50].

## Clinical Presentation
RPGN is a [[renal_pathology_and_conditions | nephritic syndrome]] [00:35:12]. Key features of a nephritic syndrome, which are used to confirm suspicion of RPGN, include:
*   **Hematuria:** Presence of blood in the urine [00:35:33].
*   **Oliguria:** Urine output less than 400 ml in 24 hours [00:35:39].
*   **Hypertension:** Elevated blood pressure [00:35:58].
*   **Azotemia:** Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, indicating kidney dysfunction [00:36:02].

## Histological Features
The hallmark histological finding in RPGN is the presence of **crescent formation** [00:35:00].
*   Crescents appear as a "half-moon flap" structure within the glomerulus [00:37:26].
*   They are primarily composed of:
    *   Fibrin [00:37:58]
    *   Parietal epithelial cells [00:38:07]
    *   Visceral epithelial cells (less common, but can be present) [00:38:49]

## Electron Microscopy (EM) Findings
Electron microscopy in RPGN typically reveals "rupture and wrinkling of the basement membrane" [00:39:41]. This is visualized as broken, spread-out pieces of what was once a joined basement membrane [00:40:02].

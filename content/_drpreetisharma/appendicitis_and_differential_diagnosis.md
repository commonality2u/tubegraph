This article discusses the diagnosis of appendicitis and other conditions that may present similarly, emphasizing the importance of histological findings. The information is drawn from a "Image of the Day and MCQ of the Day" series conducted across various social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Image of the Day: *Enterobius vermicularis*

The "Image of the Day" focused on identifying *Enterobius vermicularis*, also known as the pinworm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>, within the appendix.

### Identification Features
*   **Histopathology**: The key to identifying *Enterobius vermicularis* in histopathological sections is the presence of two lateral cuticular alae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. These are pointed projections visible on the organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The appendix itself is identifiable by its lining, goblet cells, and dense lymphoid aggregate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Microbiology (Eggs)**:
    *   **Technique**: The [[diagnosis_and_identification_of_bacterial_infections | cellulose tape method]] or tape preparation is used to collect *Enterobius* eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Morphology**: These eggs are classically described as plano-convex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, meaning they have one flat side and one curved side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Inside the egg, a tadpole larva can be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Staining**: The plano-convex eggs with tadpole larva can be observed under ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a> or with a Pap stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

### Clinical Significance
*   *Enterobius vermicularis* is usually an incidental finding in the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   It is only occasionally responsible for causing acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   The classical clinical feature associated with *Enterobius* infection is perianal itching or pruritus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## MCQ of the Day: Distinguishing Appendicitis

The "MCQ of the Day" presented a [[case_studies_and_diagnostic_challenges | case study]] of a 17-year-old girl with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and an enlarged appendix, with histological features showing dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate in the serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. The question asked for the likely diagnosis, with options including acute appendicitis and acute salpingitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

### Pathological Criteria for Acute Appendicitis
To diagnose acute appendicitis pathologically, neutrophils, which are characteristic cells of acute inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, must be observed in the muscularis propria (muscle layer) of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

### Differential Diagnosis: Peri-Appendicitis
If inflammation, specifically neutrophilic infiltrate, is seen only in the serosa (the outermost layer) of the appendix, it indicates peri-appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   **Peri-appendicitis** means that inflammation from a surrounding structure has extended onto the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   A common cause of peri-appendicitis in females is salpingitis, which is inflammation of the fallopian tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. This inflammation can extend to the serosa of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
*   In the given [[mcq_on_medical_diagnosis_related_to_appendicitis | MCQ]], since the inflammation was specifically noted in the serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>, the correct diagnosis was acute salpingitis, not acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Perforation of the appendix was also ruled out because a proper muscle layer was still visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

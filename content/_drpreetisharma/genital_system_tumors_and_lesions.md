The pathology of the [[genital_system_and_pathology | genital system]] is an important topic of study in pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is often studied alongside the [[Renal system and pathology | renal system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Ovarian Tumors
Ovarian tumors fall into the category of surface epithelial tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. A common tumor marker for these tumors is CA125 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>.

### Serous Cystadenoma
A serous cystadenoma is characterized by a uniloculated (single) cyst in the ovary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. It contains clear, watery (serous) fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. Histology typically reveals psammoma bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a> and ciliated epithelium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>. Psammoma bodies are seen in any [[Breast cancer pathology and genetics | papillary tumor]] throughout the body, including the thyroid, breast, kidney, endometrium, and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>.

### Mucinous Cystadenoma
In contrast, a mucinous cystadenoma presents as a multiloculated (multiple) cyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The fluid inside is mucinous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>. The characteristic epithelium observed is mucin-containing or empty mucinous cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

### Brenner Tumor
The Brenner tumor is also classified as a surface epithelial tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. Histologically, it shows bladder (transitional) epithelium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a> and characteristic coffee bean nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.
Approximately 25% of Brenner tumors are associated with mucinous cystadenomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

### Granulosa Cell Tumor
[[Granulosa Cell Tumor Characteristics | Granulosa cell tumor]] typically affects post-menopausal females, often around 54 years of age or older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. It is considered a hormonal tumor, leading to hyperestrogenism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. This can manifest as post-menopausal bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a> and a bulky uterus due to thickened endometrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.
Key features of this tumor include:
*   **Call-Exner bodies:** These are cells arranged in a round pattern with pink material in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.
*   **Coffee bean nuclei (nuclear grooves):** These are nuclei with a line going through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>.
*   **CD99 positivity:** This is an immunohistochemical marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.
*   **FOXO2 gene mutation:** A genetic alteration associated with the tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.
*   **Inhibin as a tumor marker:** Inhibin is a tumor marker for [[Granulosa Cell Tumor Characteristics | granulosa cell tumors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.

## Leydig Cell Tumor
Leydig cell tumors are characterized by the presence of Reinke crystalloids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

## Yolk Sac Tumor (Endodermal Sinus Tumor)
A yolk sac tumor (also known as an endodermal sinus tumor) is a pediatric tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:59">[01:18:59]</a>. Its tumor marker is Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>.

## Dysgerminoma
Dysgerminoma is often considered the "brother/sister" tumor to seminoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>. Its tumor markers include LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) and PLAP (Placental Alkaline Phosphatase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.

## Walthard Cell Rests
Walthard cell rests are not considered a disease but rather a normal anatomical finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>. They represent embryonic derivatives, clusters of cells that resemble transitional epithelium (like in the urinary bladder) but are found in miscellaneous sites such as the fallopian tube or ovary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.

The [[FMGE December 2024 exam preparation | upcoming FMGE December 2024 exam]] requires a structured approach that integrates initial study with comprehensive revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This strategy is applicable for both first-time candidates and those who previously scored below 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Overall Strategy
The key to cracking the [[FMGE exam preparation strategies | FMGE exam]] is the number of revisions and daily MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. It's considered more of a "revision game" than just content memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## [[60day study timetable for FMGE | Initial 60-Day Study Plan]] (July 24th - September 21st)
This phase focuses on completing the syllabus to enable subsequent revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Daily Study Hours**: Aim for 8 to 10 hours per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **MCQ Practice**: Solve 100 to 120 MCQs daily, gradually increasing the number if you're not accustomed to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Source Selection**: Maintain a single source per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Video Lectures**:
    *   For strong subjects (those where you consistently score above 80% in Q-bank), utilize Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   For weaker subjects or topics (scoring less than 80% in Q-bank), refer to main video lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   Specifically, for Pathology and Microbiology, only use Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. (PrepLadder Rapid Revision for Pathology is 19 hours, Microbiology is 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>).
*   **Integrated Subject Blocks**: Subjects are grouped for better integration and understanding, for example:
    *   Block 1: Anatomy (4 days), Surgery (6 days), Orthopedics (2 days), Radiology (2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   Block 2: Pathology (4 days), Microbiology (3 days), Pharmacology (4 days), Medicine (6 days), Pediatrics (2 days), Physiology (1 day), Dermatology (1 day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   Block 3: OBGY (6 days), Anesthesia (2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   Block 4: PSM (5 days), Biochemistry (3 days), ENT (2 days), Ophthalmology (2 days), FMT (2 days), Psychiatry (2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs)**: Allocate two full days for Grand Tests, including the test and its review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   GT 1: September 8th (after approximately 15 subjects are covered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   GT 2: September 21st (at the end of the 60-day timetable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Daily Routine Example:
This schedule helps manage time and avoid burnout during intensive study periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Morning Routine**: One hour (e.g., 7:00-8:00 AM) for self-care, including 20 minutes outdoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1**: 8:00-11:00 AM (3 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Break 1**: 11:00-11:30 AM (30 minutes) – relax, no screens/social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2**: 11:30 AM-2:00 PM (2.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Mega Break/Lunch**: 2:00-3:30 PM (1.5 hours) – includes lunch, power nap, or allowed screen time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3**: 3:30-6:00 PM (2.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Break 2**: 6:00-7:00 PM (1 hour) – mix of outdoor activity and social time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

*   **Nightly Review/Casual Test**: After 9:00 PM, create a custom module of 30 mixed MCQs from subjects already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This is a casual test to stay in touch with past subjects, taking about 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
*   **Wind Down**: 9:30-11:00/11:30 PM – relax, social media, web series allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Aim for 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## Post-60-Day Revision Plan
Once the 60-day syllabus completion is done, a dedicated revision plan follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Revision 1**: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Revision 2**: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Revision 3**: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   This revision cycle is planned to extend roughly until December 15th, subject to adjustment based on the official exam date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The detailed breakdown of this revision phase will be provided after the 60-day plan is completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Mindset
Maintain a positive mindset, focusing only on the current 60-day plan. Avoid past guilt or future anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Remember that "this too shall pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, and tough times build humility, leading to greater achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. In the long run, clinical skills and humility are more important than exam attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

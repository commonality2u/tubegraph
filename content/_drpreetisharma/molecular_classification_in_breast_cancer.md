The molecular classification of breast cancer is primarily based on **gene profiling** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>. However, due to technical constraints and affordability, **immunohistochemistry (IHC)** is used as a surrogate for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. The classification relies on the status of Estrogen Receptors (ER), Progesterone Receptors (PR), and [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | Her2 Neu]] (HER2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.

## Subtypes of Breast Cancer based on Molecular Classification

### Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
*   **Characteristics**: All three markers – ER, PR, and HER2 – are **negative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.
*   **Associated Tumors**:
    *   Medullary Carcinoma Breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>
    *   Metaplastic Carcinoma Breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>

### HER2-Rich Breast Cancer
*   **Characteristics**: HER2 is **positive**, while ER and PR are **negative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
*   **Associated Tumors**:
    *   Apocrine Carcinoma Breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>

### Luminal A Breast Cancer
*   **Characteristics**: ER and PR are **positive**, and HER2 is **negative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
*   **Proliferative Index (Ki67)**: Less than 14% (<14%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.
*   **Associated Tumors (often referred to as the "dustbin" category)**:
    *   Tubular Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>
    *   Mucinous Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>
    *   [[breast_cancer_lobular_carcinoma | Invasive Lobular Carcinoma]] (low grade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>

### Luminal B Breast Cancer
*   **Characteristics**: ER and PR are **positive**, and HER2 is **negative** (similar to Luminal A), but with a higher proliferative index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. It can also sometimes be triple positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.
*   **Proliferative Index (Ki67)**: More than 14% (>14%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.
*   **Associated Tumors**:
    *   [[breast_cancer_lobular_carcinoma | Invasive Lobular Carcinoma]] (high grade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>

## Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing
[[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | Her2 Neu]] amplification in breast cancer is a **gene amplification** event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.
*   **Nomenclature**: HER2 is also known as HER2/neu or EGF receptor 2 (EGFR2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. It's crucial not to confuse it with EGFR1 (which is mutated in adenocarcinoma lung) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **Scoring**: IHC for HER2 is scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.
    *   **0 and 1+**: Negative, indicating no [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | Her2 Neu]] amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.
    *   **3+**: Positive, indicating [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | Her2 Neu]] amplification. Patients will typically receive targeted therapy like Trastuzumab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
    *   **2+**: Equivocal. In such cases, **FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization)** is the next line of investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.

### FISH for Her2 Neu Amplification
*   FISH uses probes for the HER2 gene (often labeled red) and Chromosome 17 centromere (often labeled green, as HER2 is on Chromosome 17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   **Interpretation**: The ratio of HER2 signals to Chromosome 17 signals is calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>.
    *   If the ratio crosses **2.2**, it indicates [[Her2 Neu Amplification and Testing | Her2 Neu]] amplification, and the patient is given Trastuzumab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
    *   If the ratio is less than 2.2, it is not considered amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

## Male Breast Cancer
Male breast cancer is much less common than female breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.
*   **Associated Mutation**: Most commonly associated with [[breast_cancer_pathology_and_genetics | BRCA mutation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.
*   **Most Common Morphology**: Invasive Ductal Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.
*   **Equal Incidence Tumor**: Myofibroblastoma (also known as MF tumor) is a rare breast tumor that has an equal incidence in both males and females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.

### Other Breast Cancer Findings:
*   **Mucinous Carcinoma (Colloid Carcinoma)**: Characterized by tumor cells floating in **extracellular pools of mucin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. While predominantly extracellular, it can sometimes have intracellular mucin as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.
*   **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma**: Known for its "Indian file pattern" of tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>. It can also rarely show signet ring cells with intracellular mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>. This type of cancer can be bilateral and multicentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.
*   **Chicken Wire Blood Vessels**: Seen on FNAC of mucinous breast carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.
*   **Peau d'orange Appearance**: Characteristic of Inflammatory Carcinoma of the breast, due to dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

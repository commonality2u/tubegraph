Microscopy is a fundamental technique in microbiology, enabling the visualization and study of microscopic organisms and structures. This article covers different types of microscopes and their specific applications in microbiology, drawing from various [[Microscopy techniques in microbiology|microscopy techniques in microbiology]] and [[Medical Microscopy Techniques|medical microscopy techniques]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

## Light Microscope

The light microscope is a common instrument used in microbiology. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

### Components and Function
*   **Light Source**: It uses transmitted light, meaning light passes through the specimen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   **Condenser**: This component is located below the stage and focuses light onto the specimen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
*   **Objective Lens**: These lenses are close to the object and typically come in magnifications of 4x, 10x, 40x, and 100x. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
*   **Eyepiece Lens**: The eyepiece lens is where the observer looks, and its maximum magnification is typically 10x. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
*   **Total Magnification**: The maximum total magnification achievable with a light microscope is 1000x (10x eyepiece multiplied by 100x objective). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>

## Fluorescent Microscope

A fluorescent microscope appears similar to a light microscope but includes additional components like dichroic mirrors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>

### Key Features and Stains
*   **Light Source**: It uses ultraviolet (UV) light. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   **Dichroic Mirrors**: These mirrors convert short wavelength light into longer wavelength light. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
*   **Applications and [[Diagnostic staining techniques Fluorescent stains for bacteria and fungi|Fluorescent Stains]]**:
    *   **Mycobacterial TB**: [[Gram staining and other staining techniques|Auramine and Rhodamine stain]] are used. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> (Note: Rhodanine is a different stain used for copper in Wilson's Disease. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>)
    *   **Malaria**: Acridine orange is the fluorescent stain. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
    *   **Fungus**: [[Mycology and fungal staining techniques|Calcofluor White]] is used for fungal staining. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

## Electron Microscope

The electron microscope has a distinct, enclosed "space rocket" appearance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>

### Unique Characteristics
*   **Operation Environment**: It operates in a vacuum and is enclosed to maintain this vacuum. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>
*   **Illumination**: Unlike light microscopes, it does not use light; it uses electrons. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   **Virus Visualization**: Viruses, being extremely small, can only be seen with an electron microscope. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>

*   **Dark Field Microscope**: This type of microscope is specifically used for the diagnosis of syphilis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a> It is often associated with the clinical history of a "truck driver" due to the association with sexually transmitted diseases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>

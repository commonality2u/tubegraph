DiGeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by a specific deletion on chromosome 22, often summarized by the "CATCH-22" mnemonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

A typical presentation involves a young infant (e.g., three-month-old male) with severe muscle spasms and seizures, recurrent infections, and feeding difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Physical examination might reveal a dysmorphic face and a cleft palate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. A chest X-ray often shows an absent thymic shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The seizures in these patients are primarily caused by hypocalcemia, which results from decreased calcium levels in the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## CATCH-22 Mnemonic

The CATCH-22 mnemonic helps to remember the key features of DiGeorge syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>:

*   **C - Cardiac abnormalities:** Various cardiac abnormalities can be seen, with [[Tetralogy of Fallot]] being a frequently tested one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **A - Abnormal facies:** Patients present with dysmorphic or abnormal facial features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **T - Thymic aplasia:** The thymus gland is not developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This leads to impaired T-cell development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, resulting in recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. An absent thymic shadow on chest X-ray is a characteristic finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **C - Cleft palate:** A cleft palate is a common finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **H - Hypocalcemia:** Due to the underdeveloped parathyroid glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, parathyroid hormone levels decrease, leading to low calcium levels and consequently, seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **22 - Chromosome 22 deletion:** The underlying genetic cause is a deletion on chromosome 22, specifically 22q11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Genetics and Diagnosis

### Chromosomal Deletion
The specific deletion associated with DiGeorge syndrome is 22q11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. It's crucial to differentiate this from a deletion of 11q22, which is associated with [[ataxia_telangiectasia|ataxia-telangiectasia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Affected Gene
The gene deleted in DiGeorge syndrome is TBX1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Problems with the TBX1 gene have also been associated with schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Diagnostic Method
The primary method for testing this chromosomal deletion is [[FISH analysis]] (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

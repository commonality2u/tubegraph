Preparing for the FMGE exam requires a structured [[revision_plan_and_strategies_for_fmge | revision plan and strategy]], especially given the limited time available. This guide outlines effective [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | rapid revision techniques]], question-solving strategies, and time management tips for the December 2023 attempt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

## Overcoming Anxiety and Building a Positive Mindset
It's common to feel anxious or demotivated after previous exam results. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> However, it's crucial to focus on the available opportunity, such as the December 2023 exam, and find a "ray of hope" to keep going. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> The current situation can be seen as a "75 hard challenge" for your studies, focusing on consistent effort rather than just motivation from external sources. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>

> [!TIP] Embrace the challenge: "It's not over until you win." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a> Write down your target score and your purpose for studying to keep yourself accountable and motivated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>

## Time Management and Study Schedule
You have approximately three months to prepare for the FMGE December 2023 exam. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> The goal is to complete notes and MCQs, and then engage in at least 2-3 revisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>

### Daily Study Hours
Aim for 12 to 14 hours of dedicated study per day. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a> This does not mean sacrificing sleep or social media entirely, but effectively utilizing the time you allocate for studies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>

### 46-Day Plan for Syllabus Completion
A 46-day timetable is proposed for the initial completion of your syllabus. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>

> [!NOTE] Start with a Grand Test: Before beginning the 46-day plan, take a Grand Test today to establish a baseline score. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a> This initial score, no matter how low, will help you track progress and identify weak areas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>

For students who struggle with making timetables, a day-wise plan is provided, balancing big and small subjects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> While a 100% adherence to a daily timetable is rare, aiming for 80-85% completion of daily backlogs is sufficient. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>

## Balancing Theory and MCQs
[[balancing_mcqs_and_theory_in_fmge_preparation | Balancing MCQs and Theory]] is non-negotiable; you must solve MCQs side-by-side with your theory preparation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> Solve questions topic-wise or chapter-wise as you complete the theory. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>

### Source of Questions
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs):** For subject-wise PYQs, FMGE Solutions is a good source. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> PYQs are essential for understanding frequently asked topics, but they are typically fact-based and one-liners. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   **Clinical Question Bank:** Due to the increasingly clinical nature of the exams, it is crucial to practice from a clinical question bank, such as the one available on PrepLadder. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> These questions are lengthier and require more time management practice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>
*   **NEET PG PYQs:** Aim to solve at least 3 years, and ideally 5 years, of NEET PG previous year questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>

> [!WARNING] Don't change sources: Stick to the platform and notes you've been using. Only make minor additions as exam patterns change, rather than switching entirely. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>

### Daily Question Targets
Students who cleared the exam typically solved 100-150 questions per day. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a> Start with a lower number, like 50 questions, and gradually increase it by 5-7 questions daily until you reach 100 questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>

## Revision Strategies
Once the syllabus is completed, focus on revision. Revision should primarily be done through notes, not by re-watching videos. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>

### Rapid Revision vs. Main Videos
*   **Prioritize [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | Rapid Revision]]**: For most subjects, focus on [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | rapid revision]] materials to finish the syllabus in 45-50 days. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   **Use Main Videos Judiciously**: If you encounter a concept you don't understand during [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | rapid revision]], only then go back to the main video for that specific concept and return to your rapid notes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
*   **Key Subjects for Main Videos**: For highly scoring and conceptual subjects like OBG and PSM (which can have 40+ questions each), it's advisable to go through the main videos if time permits, especially if you are a fresh student. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>

### Revising Volatile Subjects
Subjects like Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Microbiology are volatile. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a> For these, it's not about reading extensive books or main videos, but about reading limited information from [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | rapid revision]] notes multiple times. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> The goal is to know the information with high accuracy, almost like recalling the exact slide or page. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> The [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | rapid revision]] of Pathology and Microbiology is 100% sufficient for FMGE and NEET exams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>

### Medicine
Medicine is a vast subject that can cause anxiety if approached head-on for a full week. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a> Instead, dedicate one hour every day to medicine as a ritual. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a> This ensures consistent engagement and integration with other subjects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>

### Active Recall for Effective Revision
Active recall is crucial for retaining information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>
*   **Self-Questioning:** Cover one side of your notes and actively recall the answers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a> Ask yourself questions and try to answer them before looking at the solution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>
*   **Peer-to-Peer:** If studying with someone, ask each other questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>
*   **Beyond Passive Learning:** Simply listening to videos or classes (passive learning) provides a "pseudo-confidence." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a> Active learning, where you engage with the material and test yourself, is what truly yields marks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>

### Strategic Bookmarking
When solving questions, bookmark selectively. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a> Only bookmark questions or concepts that you consistently forget or find difficult. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a> Avoid bookmarking too many questions (e.g., 60 out of 100) as you won't be able to revise them all effectively later. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>

### Analyzing Grand Test (GT) Scores
Don't be discouraged by initial low GT scores. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a> Improve your GT score gradually by setting small targets, aiming for a 10-point increase in each subsequent test. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> Analyze your GT results to identify weak subjects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a> Focus on revising those specific areas thoroughly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>

> [!WARNING] Avoid Mental Pressure: Don't pressurize yourself to achieve a 150+ score from the very first Grand Test. Three months allow for gradual improvement. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>

## Final Thoughts
The FMGE exam pattern has changed, becoming more clinical and lengthy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a> This means that while the core topics remain the same, the presentation of questions requires practicing time management for longer questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a> The difficulty level is unlikely to increase beyond what was seen in July, so confidence in your prepared material and consistent revision is key. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>

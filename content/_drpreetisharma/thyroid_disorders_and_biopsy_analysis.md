Thyroid conditions are a significant area of study in pathology, with various diagnostic methods and characteristic findings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

## Thyroid Gland Anatomy and Histology

The thyroid gland is located in the anterior neck. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
Its normal histology shows:
*   **Follicles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Colloid** (pink material within follicles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   **Follicular epithelial cells** (lining the follicles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   **Parafollicular C cells** (cluster of cells not directly associated with colloid, produce calcitonin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

## Thyroid Biopsy Analysis

### Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) of the Thyroid

FNAC is a common [[diagnostic_methods_and_pathology_in_liver_diseases | diagnostic method]] for thyroid nodules. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>

#### Adequacy Criteria (Bethesda System)
For an FNAC to be considered adequate, it should meet the "Rule of 6-10":
*   At least six follicles should be visible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>
*   Each follicle should contain at least 10 cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>

#### Exceptions to Adequacy Rule
Even if the above criteria are not met, a pathologist may still issue a report if:
1.  **Malignancy is suspected:** If even five cells show features of papillary carcinoma thyroid, a report must be given. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
2.  **Colloid goiter:** When the needle primarily yields fluid-like colloid with few cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
3.  **Inflammation:** In cases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis, where inflammation is prominent and follicular cells are destroyed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

#### Specific FNAC Findings
*   **Chewing gum colloid:** Stretched-out pink material, characteristic of papillary thyroid carcinoma on FNAC due to the thick colloid getting stuck in thin needles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>
*   **Chicken wire blood vessels:** Seen on FNAC in mucinous [[breast_cancer_pathology_and_genetics | breast cancer]] and oligodendroglioma (brain). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>

## Thyroid Disorders and Cancers

### Goiter
*   **Non-toxic goiter:** Characterized by symmetrical enlargement of the thyroid gland without symptoms of hyper- or hypothyroidism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
*   **Colloid goiter:** A type of goiter where excess colloid is present. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>

### Graves' Disease
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Symptoms of hyperthyroidism including nervousness, muscle weakness, heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss, dyspnea, palpitations, menstrual irregularities, and warm, moist skin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>
*   **Pathogenesis:** Caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI), previously known as long-acting thyroid stimulators (LATS), that bind to and stimulate TSH receptors, leading to increased T3 and T4 production. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>
*   **Hypersensitivity:** Belongs to Type II hypersensitivity, though some sources categorize it as Type V. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>
*   **Gross Appearance:** Beefy red thyroid gland due to hyperactivity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>
*   **Microscopic Findings:**
    *   Follicular hyperplasia with pseudo-papillae (lacking fibrovascular cores). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>
    *   Scalloping of colloid (colloid appears "eaten away" or scooped out). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>

### Hashimoto's Thyroiditis
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Hypothyroidism due to destruction of the thyroid gland. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>
*   **Microscopic Findings:**
    *   Dense lymphoid infiltrates with prominent germinal centers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>
    *   Hurthle cells (also known as Askanazy cells): Large, eosinophilic follicular cells, representing a compensatory reaction to thyroid destruction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>
*   **Association:** Can precede papillary thyroid carcinoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>

### Riedel's Thyroiditis
*   Characterized by extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland, making it very hard on palpation and mimicking malignancy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>

### Thyroid Cancers

#### Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC)
*   **Prognosis:** Excellent prognosis with nearly 100% survival. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>
*   **Associations:**
    *   Most common thyroid cancer associated with radiation exposure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>
    *   Can follow Hashimoto's thyroiditis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>
*   **Genetic Alterations:**
    *   Most common: BRAF V600E mutation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>
    *   Second most common: RET/PTC fusion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>
*   **Microscopic Findings (Biopsy):**
    *   **True Papillae:** Finger-like projections with a fibrovascular core. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
    *   **Orphan Annie Eye Nuclei:** Optically clear or white nuclei, an artifact due to formalin fixation, hence seen on biopsy but NOT on FNAC. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>
    *   **Psammoma Bodies:** Round, lamellated calcifications (random blue material). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>
    *   **Intranuclear Inclusions (Intranuclear Cytoplasmic Inclusions - INCI):** Cytoplasm invaginating into the nucleus. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>
    *   **Intranuclear Grooves (Coffee Bean Nuclei):** Linear invaginations in the nucleus. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>

#### Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma
*   **Genetic Alterations:** Most common is RAS mutation, followed by PTEN, PI3K, and PAX8/PPARÎ³ mutations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>

#### Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC)
*   **Origin:** Arises from parafollicular C cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
*   **Tumor Marker:** Calcitonin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>
*   **Microscopic Findings:** Amyloid deposits (pink material) which can be confirmed by Congo Red stain showing apple-green birefringence under polarizing microscopy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>
*   **Genetic Alterations:** RET gene mutation (specifically on chromosome 10), associated with MEN2A and MEN2B syndromes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>
    *   *Contrast:* RET mutation alone causes MTC, while RET/PTC fusion causes papillary thyroid carcinoma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>
    *   *Pediatric Relevance:* Loss of function of the RET gene is associated with Hirschsprung's disease (absence of ganglion cells in the colon). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>

#### Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma
*   **Prognosis:** Worst prognosis among thyroid cancers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>

*   **Microscopic Findings:** Rosenthal fibers (pink fibers). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>

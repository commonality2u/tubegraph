The Camp test is a [[microbiological_tests_and_culture_media | microbiological test]] used in [[diagnostics_in_pathology_and_microbiology | pathology and microbiology]] to identify specific bacterial pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. It is named after the scientists Christy, Atkins, and Munch-Petersen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This test is crucial for [[diseases_related_to_specific_pathogens_and_their_diagnostic_tests | diagnosing diseases related to specific pathogens]] and is often encountered in [[pathology_and_microbiology_clinical_mcqs | clinical MCQs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## The Camp Test

The Camp test is positive for *Streptococcus agalactiae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. In this test, *Streptococcus agalactiae* is streaked perpendicular to a main streak of *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. A positive result is indicated by an arrow-shaped zone of enhanced hemolysis where the two streaks intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

> [01:12:00] A 3-week-old infant presents with fever, irritability, and poor feeding for 2 days. Examination reveals a temperature of 38Â°C and petechial rashes. Blood culture and spinal tap are drawn due to suspicion of meningitis.

*Streptococcus agalactiae* is clinically significant as it can cause meningitis and pneumonia in neonates and infants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Therefore, the Camp test is performed for the diagnosis of *Streptococcus agalactiae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Reverse Camp Test

The reverse Camp test is a variation where *Streptococcus agalactiae* is used to aid in the diagnosis of *Clostridium perfringens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. In this case, the main streak on the agar plate is *Clostridium perfringens*, while a streak of *Streptococcus agalactiae* is made perpendicular to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

### Summary of Camp Tests:
*   **Camp Test**: Done for the diagnosis of *Streptococcus agalactiae*, using a *Staphylococcus aureus* streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Reverse Camp Test**: Uses *Streptococcus agalactiae* for the diagnosis of *Clostridium perfringens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

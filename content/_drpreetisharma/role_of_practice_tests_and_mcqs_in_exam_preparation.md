As competitive exams approach, particularly in the final 10 days, the strategic use of practice tests and Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) becomes paramount. This period is often described as "make or break," where focused preparation can significantly impact outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Importance of Practice Questions and Previous Year Papers

### Grand Tests (GTs)
Deciding whether to take a grand test in the final days is a personal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Pros**: Taking a grand test can be beneficial for managing time and identifying [[mcq_examination_tips | silly mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>.
*   **Cons**: A low score can induce panic and anxiety, hindering further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: If you choose to take a GT, prioritize time management—ensuring you can complete 300 questions within the allotted time—and catching [[mcq_examination_tips | silly mistakes]], rather than focusing on the score itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   **"Bouncer" Questions**: Expect 20-30 "new" or "bouncer" questions in any exam or grand test. These are designed to prevent overconfidence and do not determine your pass or fail status. Focus on the questions you know and avoiding errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:08:00">[42:08:00]</a>.
*   **Analysis**: Post-GT, quickly analyze where mistakes were made:
    *   **[[mcq_examination_tips | Silly Mistakes]]**: Indicates a need for more [[mcq_practice_for_competitive_exams | MCQ practice]] to improve careful reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Knowledge Gaps**: If you've never heard of a topic, quickly review it from your LRR (Last Revision Revision) notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>. Superficial reading of explanations is sufficient for wrong answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

### Role of MCQs
In the final days, shift your study focus heavily towards MCQs.
*   **Study Time Allocation**: Divide your daily study time into 60% dedicated to MCQs and 40% to theory revision, primarily using LRR PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>.
*   **Quantity**: Aim to solve at least 150+ MCQs daily, with 200+ being a strong target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a>. Gradually increase your daily count by 10-15 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>.
*   **[[mcq_practice_for_competitive_exams | Custom Modules]]**: Utilizing custom modules on platforms like PrepLadder can act as mini grand tests, allowing you to practice specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:08:00">[34:08:00]</a>.

### Previous Year Questions (PYQs)
[[importance_of_practice_questions_and_previous_year_papers | Previous year papers]] are a critical component of preparation.
*   **FMG PYQs**: Completing the last five years of FMG PYQs is non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Topics, Not Just Answers**: Simply memorizing PYQ answers is ineffective as questions are rarely copied verbatim. Instead, focus on understanding the underlying "previous year topics" from which questions are drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.
*   **Additional PYQs (If Time Permits)**:
    *   Three years of NEET PG questions (2020, 2021, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>.
    *   The IAI CET exam (November) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>.
*   **Utilizing Recall Sessions**: If you lack time to solve these papers yourself, listen to recall sessions on platforms like YouTube at 1.5x or 2x speed. This ensures some knowledge retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>.
*   **Flashback Sessions**: Many platforms offer "flashback sessions" on YouTube that cover all 19 subjects' previous year questions, serving as an excellent resource if you're not using books or apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The strategic application of [[mcq_practice_for_competitive_exams | MCQ practice]] and [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_previous_year_papers | previous year papers]] is vital in the final preparation phase. Prioritizing time management, analyzing mistakes to understand their root cause, and focusing on topics rather than rote memorization of answers will significantly boost your readiness for the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>.

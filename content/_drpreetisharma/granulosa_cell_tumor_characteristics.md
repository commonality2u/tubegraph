Granulosa cell tumor is a type of ovarian tumor commonly observed in post-menopausal women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Genetic Basis
The development of granulosa cell tumors is linked to the FOXL2 gene mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This mutation leads to elevated estrogen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Patients often present with symptoms related to hyperestrogenism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This includes a bulky uterus and post-menopausal bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Microscopic Features
Under the microscope, key features of granulosa cell tumor include:
*   **Call-Exner Bodies**: These are classical findings, appearing as tumor cells arranged in a round fashion with pink material in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Grooves**: The cells display nuclear grooves, often described as a "coffee bean appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

> [!mnemic] Granulosa Cell Tumor Mnemonic
> "Granny" (post-menopausal female) suddenly becomes "very hormonal" (hyperestrogenic) because of a "mutation" (FOXL2) and is "calling her ex for coffee" (Call-Exner bodies, coffee bean appearance), which "she shouldn't" (inhibited tumor marker: Inhibin) and is "99" (positive for CD99) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Tumor Markers and Immunohistochemistry
*   **Inhibin**: A significant tumor marker for granulosa cell tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **CD99**: The tumor is also positive for CD99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis
Another ovarian tumor that can also exhibit the "coffee bean appearance" is a Brenner tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

> [!mnemic] Coffee Bean Appearance Mnemonic
> To remember the tumors with "coffee bean appearance": "coffee grains" (granulosa) and "brew the coffee" (Brenner) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

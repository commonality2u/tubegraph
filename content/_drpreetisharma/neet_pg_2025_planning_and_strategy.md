This guide outlines a comprehensive [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | exam preparation and strategy]] for students targeting [[neet_pg_2024_exam_preparation_strategy | NEET PG 2025]]. It emphasizes adaptability, discipline, and effective study methods given the unpredictable nature of the exam date.

## Understanding the Exam Landscape
The exact date for [[neet_pg_2024_exam_preparation_strategy | NEET PG 2025]] is currently unknown and has been subject to previous uncertainties, making it impossible to predict accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Due to delays in counseling and the unlikelihood of a March exam, it is suggested that the exam will not be in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The best approach is to create a flexible study plan and adjust as the date unfolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Core Principles for Preparation
*   **Discipline and Consistency**: Creating a timetable is easy, but following it requires significant discipline and willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Avoid procrastination and dedicate specific time slots to studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Time Management**: Allocate specific time frames for studies, internships, social media, and family to prevent mental exhaustion, especially without a fixed deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Health as Priority**: Prioritize both physical and mental health above all else. An exam is important, but health is life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

## Study Plan: A 65-Day Approach
A 65-day plan is proposed, which can be customized by adding 2-3 days for long subjects and one day for short subjects for interns or working doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Subject-Wise Time Allocation (Approximate Days)
This schedule aims to balance subjects and includes occasional Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

*   Anatomy: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
*   ENT: 3 days (due to increasing difficulty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   Pathology: 5 days (recommended [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_neet_pg | rapid revision videos]] of ~20 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
*   Microbiology: 4 days (recommended [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_neet_pg | rapid revision videos]] of ~15 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
*   Short Subjects (Derma, Anesthesia, Radiology): 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>
*   PSM: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days (includes GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   OBGY: 6 days (for first, extensive read with MCQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   Ophthalmology (Opha): 3 days (neuro-ophthalmology is demanding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>
*   Pharmacology (Pharma): 5 days (includes GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Physiology: 2 days (best studied at the end as it covers many topics from other subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>

### Special Strategy for Medicine
Instead of studying medicine in a single block, dedicate 1-1.5 hours to it daily. This helps with integration, reduces toxicity, and allows for consistent "clinical exposure" through videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Fix a specific time, like 10 PM, for medicine to ensure consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. If daily study is difficult, add extra days to the timetable for dedicated medicine study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

### Daily Routine
*   **Morning (1 hour)**: Dedicated to MCQs. Start with a custom module of subjects already completed, then expand to all subjects as more are finished. This acts as a mini-GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Night (1 hour)**: Dedicated to Medicine videos/notes for clinical exposure and daily integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Study Resources and Methods

### Notes and QBank
The two primary modalities for studying are notes and a QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Stick to one platform for notes and videos to avoid confusion and content overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.

### Volatile Topics / 20th Notebook
Maintain a separate "20th notebook" or "chy copy" for volatile topics and Grand Test mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. This notebook should *only* contain topics (e.g., "Incubation periods from Rapid Revision"), not detailed notes, to avoid becoming bulkier than original notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Create this personally as you know what you forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Subject-wise vs. System-wise Study
*   **Second/Third/Fourth Revision (Syllabus done)**: System-wise study is fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **First-timers/Interns**: Stick to subject-wise study to avoid missing general topics (e.g., General Pathology, General Microbiology) which don't fit easily into a system-wise approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_neet_pg | Rapid Revision (RR) vs. Main Videos]]
*   **Working Doctors/Interns**: Heavily rely on [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_neet_pg | rapid revision]] videos as completing main videos is nearly impossible with limited daily study hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Use main videos only for specific topics you struggle to understand from RR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
*   **General Recommendation**: If you've never viewed the videos, go for RR 6.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. If you have viewed RR 5.0, stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. RR videos condense extensive content into a more concise format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **Passive Learning**: Watching videos is for initial understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. After one or two watches, focus on active recall using your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
GTs are crucial for assessment and guidance, not just scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: For those less comfortable with the syllabus, 3 GTs in 65 days is a good start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. If comfortable, aim for one GT every 15 days or even weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   **Same-Day Analysis**: Immediately after a GT, analyze incorrect answers first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
    *   **Layered Analysis**: Review:
        1.  Incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>
        2.  Questions where you were confused or guessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>
        3.  Correct answers (scan explanations quickly if you know why it's correct) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>
    *   **Identify Weak Areas**: Use GT analysis to pinpoint weaker subjects (e.g., Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology) or question types (factual vs. clinical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
    *   **Improvement**: If scores aren't improving, it's either due to insufficient revision of notes or inadequate question practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Increase daily question count (e.g., from 40 to 60) if MCQ attempt strategy is the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
*   **Overcoming GT Fear**: Face your fears by giving GTs regularly. View mistakes as a chance to learn now, rather than during the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. If the "Grand Test" label causes anxiety, rename it to "custom module" or "practice question module" and solve questions with a timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

## Revisions
The number of revisions depends on the exam date, but expect multiple. The first reading is comprehensive, followed by narrowing down to [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_neet_pg | rapid revision]] and then filtered/volatile topics for subsequent quick revisions (e.g., a 10-day revision focusing only on volatile topics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Communication and Community
*   **Telegram Quizzes**: December is for [[fmge_december_2023_preparation_strategy | FMGE quizzes]], but NEET PG students should also attempt them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Specific NEET PG quizzes are scheduled for January and February on the PrepLadder app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **YouTube Live Classes**: Starting February, there will be weekly sessions focusing on MCQ solving strategies, not re-teaching theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Discussion**: Use the comment section for strategy doubts related to [[neet_pg_2024_exam_preparation_strategy | NEET PG 2025]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.

Ultimately, keep your [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | strategy]] simple: focus on notes and QBank, and work on analyzing your performance to continuously improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

Breast cancer is a significant [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | pathological condition]], and its diagnosis and classification involve various techniques and molecular markers.

## General Characteristics and Incidence
Breast cancer is much less common in males than in females, but it can occur in both sexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>. The gold standard for diagnosing any carcinoma, including breast cancer, is a biopsy (incisional or excisional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

## Specific Types and Features

### Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)
*   The most common morphological type of male breast cancer is invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.

### Mucinous Carcinoma
*   Presents as a soft, jelly-like palpable breast mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   Characterized by tumor cells floating in pools of mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   Predominantly shows extracellular mucin, but can also have intracellular mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.
*   On FNAC, it may show "chicken wire blood vessels" due to the thick mucin getting stuck in the needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>.

### Invasive Lobular Carcinoma
*   Commonly occurs in post-menopausal women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.
*   Histology shows tumor cells arranged in a single file pattern, known as an "Indian file pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>.
*   May also feature signet ring cells, where mucin is only intracellular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.
*   It is known to be bilateral and multicentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. Pathologist reports often advise examining the contralateral breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
*   If classified as low-grade, it falls under Luminal A, while high-grade would be Luminal B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

### Inflammatory Carcinoma
*   Named for its clinical appearance rather than actual inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
*   Patients present with dimpling or "orange peel" (peau d'orange) appearance of the overlying skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.
*   This is due to dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

### Myofibroblastoma (MF Tumor)
*   A rare tumor with an equal incidence in males and females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
*   Its name, "MF tumor" (MyoFibroblastoma), reflects its occurrence in both genders (M and F) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

### Radial Scar
*   A breast lesion that can show a central stellate scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

## Diagnostic Techniques

### Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
*   A common diagnostic technique in pathology. Brown staining in IHC is due to diaminobenzidine (DAB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   Used for [[HER2neu in Breast Cancer Immunohistochemistry and Gene Amplification | HER2neu]] receptor status assessment, with scores ranging from 0 to 3+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
    *   0 and 1+ are negative, indicating trastuzumab is not given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
    *   3+ is positive, indicating trastuzumab is definitely given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
    *   2+ is equivocal, requiring further investigation with FISH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization)
*   Used to confirm [[HER2neu in Breast Cancer Immunohistochemistry and Gene Amplification | HER2neu]] amplification when IHC results are equivocal (2+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   [[HER2neu in Breast Cancer Immunohistochemistry and Gene Amplification | HER2neu]] gene is located on chromosome 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   FISH determines amplification by calculating the ratio of HER2neu signals to chromosome 17 signals. A ratio greater than 2.2 indicates amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

## Molecular Classification
The basis of molecular classification for breast cancer is gene profiling, though immunohistochemistry (ER, PR, HER2neu) is used as a surrogate due to practical constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

### Main Categories:
*   **Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)**:
    *   ER, PR, and [[HER2neu in Breast Cancer Immunohistochemistry and Gene Amplification | HER2neu]] are all negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
    *   Examples include Medullary Carcinoma and Metaplastic Carcinoma of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.
*   **HER2-Rich Breast Cancer**:
    *   [[HER2neu in Breast Cancer Immunohistochemistry and Gene Amplification | HER2neu]] is positive, while ER and PR are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
    *   An example is Apocrine Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.
*   **Luminal A**:
    *   ER and PR are positive, and [[HER2neu in Breast Cancer Immunohistochemistry and Gene Amplification | HER2neu]] is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
    *   Characterized by a Ki-67 proliferation index less than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.
    *   Includes low-grade invasive lobular carcinoma, tubular carcinoma, and mucinous carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   **Luminal B**:
    *   ER and PR are positive, and [[HER2neu in Breast Cancer Immunohistochemistry and Gene Amplification | HER2neu]] can be either positive or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.
    *   Characterized by a Ki-67 proliferation index greater than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.
    *   Includes high-grade invasive lobular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.
    *   Can sometimes be "triple positive" (ER+, PR+, HER2+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.
*   **Ki-67**: A proliferation marker, also known as MIB-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>.

## Genetic Mutations in Male Breast Cancer
*   Male breast cancer is associated with BRCA mutations, particularly BRCA2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

For students preparing for the [[fmge_january_2024_exam_strategy | FMGE January 20th exam]], rapid revision (RR) is emphasized as the primary strategy for covering the syllabus in the available time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. With approximately two months in hand, it is crucial to focus on efficient study methods rather than attempting to cover everything in depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Rapid Revision vs. Main Videos
The recommended approach is to predominantly use rapid revision videos. Main videos should only be consulted to clarify concepts that are unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. For example, if a concept in microbiology isn't understood from RR, one can open the main videos, watch for 10 minutes to clarify, and then return to rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This strategy applies to all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. It is not practical to go through 70-80 hours of main videos per subject with 65-66 days remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Sources for Revision
Students should continue using the source they have been following for their studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. If no source has been used before, PrepLadder's rapid revision is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.

## Subject-Specific Revision Strategies

### Pathology & Microbiology
For [[revision_techniques_for_fmge_exam | Pathology]] and [[revision_techniques_for_fmge_exam | Microbiology]], rapid revision is the primary method for the first round of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Daily targets for these two subjects will be provided after December 24th, following the completion of the initial revision round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>. These daily targets will focus on specific, high-yield topics, designed to take 30-40 minutes per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.

### Medicine
Medicine should not be studied in large, continuous blocks (e.g., 10 days straight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. Instead, it should be approached daily for 1 to 1.5 hours, starting around November 23rd and continuing until January 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. This daily discipline helps integrate it into the study routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. When starting medicine, using rapid revision notes and videos is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>.

### Volatile Subjects
Subjects like Biochemistry, Anatomy, and Pharmacology, which are prone to being forgotten, should be scheduled closer to the exam date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. This allows for better retention. When revising these, use quick notes, rapid revision, and LRR (Last Revision Round) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.

## Integrating MCQs with Theory
[[balancing_mcqs_and_theory_in_fmge_preparation | MCQs]] must be practiced alongside theory every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. It's not a sequential process where theory is completed first and then MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. The goal is to cross 100 questions daily, but students can start with 50 and gradually increase by 5-7 questions per day to build speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>. The focus should be on solving questions topic-wise as the theory is covered, not on a fixed number of questions per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:26:00">[53:26:00]</a>.

For questions, utilize any Q-bank platform that a student is already subscribed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Additionally, concentrate on previous year *topics* rather than memorizing previous year *questions* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This means if a topic like apoptosis has appeared multiple times in previous years, it should be studied thoroughly from notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Effective Study Habits for Revision
*   **Study Hours**: Aim for at least 10-12 effective study hours per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This accounts for distractions and time wastage, so 12 hours of sitting time might yield 10 effective hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Note-Taking for Revision**: When reading, highlight only the most critical 5-10 words on a page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. This makes it easier to quickly scan and revise topics on the last day before an exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.
*   **Managing Forgetfulness**: Forgetting is a natural human tendency. Accept that revision is a continuous cycle of reading, forgetting, and re-reading until the exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. Don't expect to remember everything perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.
*   **[[time_management_and_study_schedule_for_fmge | Time Management]]**: Focus on [[daily_routine_for_effective_fmge_preparation | daily targets]] and avoid worrying about outcomes or external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>. Create a strict [[time_management_and_study_techniques_for_fmge | timetable]] and adhere to it without allowing for "breathing space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs)**: Aim to take a minimum of five Grand Tests before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. The primary purpose of GTs is [[time_management and study schedule for FMGE | time management]] and identifying weak areas, not solely for scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>. Analyze incorrect questions thoroughly, referring to explanations from your chosen app/source, but only briefly revisit correct answers in your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. GT scores on platforms are often tougher than the main exam, so a 150+ in a GT might translate to 170-180+ in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>.
*   **Physical and Mental Health**: Incorporate 30-40 minutes of physical activity or a walk daily to maintain mobility and aid mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>. Ensure adequate sleep (around 6 hours for healthy functioning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>. Practice deep breathing or meditation to manage stress and keep heart rate normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>. Avoid negative influences and maintain a positive outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>.

## Overall [[revision_plan_and_strategies_for_fmge | Revision Plan]]
The suggested [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | timetable]] is designed for everyone, including those starting late or those who have already covered some ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:55:00">[46:55:00]</a>. It emphasizes completing the first round of subjects using rapid revision, followed by a second round and a third focused on previous year topics and volatile areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. Students who have already completed RR can use the allocated days to do multiple revisions or solve extra questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:12:00">[46:12:00]</a>. The focus should be on consistent effort and sticking to the plan to achieve the desired outcome by January 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>.

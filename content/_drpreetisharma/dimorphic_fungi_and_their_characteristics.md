[[introduction_to_mycology | Mycology]] is the study of fungi, which gained significant importance, especially after COVID-19 [00:00:10 | 00:00:32].

## Defining Dimorphism
Dimorphic fungi exist in two forms: yeast and mold [00:07:49].
*   **Yeast form:** Typically tiny and seen at a higher temperature of 37 degrees Celsius ("heat") [00:07:52 | 00:08:16].
*   **Mold (Hyphal) form:** Seen at a lower temperature of 25 degrees Celsius ("cold") [00:07:58 | 00:08:18].

## Staining and Culture Techniques for Fungi
To study fungal culture morphology, [[fungal_staining_techniques | lactophenol cotton blue]] (LPCB) is the best stain [00:00:39 | 00:00:56]. Fungal media often include [[diagnosis_and_identification_of_bacterial_and_fungal_infections | Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar]] (SDA) [00:02:44].

Other important stains include:
*   **Gomori Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain:** Turns fungal hyphae black [00:01:12 | 00:01:47].
*   **PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) stain:** Turns fungal hyphae pink [00:01:53 | 00:02:01].
*   **Calco Fluor White:** A fluorescent dye that makes the background very dark and organisms fluorescent [00:02:05 | 00:02:32].

## Mnemonic for Dimorphic Fungi
The mnemonic for remembering dimorphic fungi is "Body Heat Probably Changes Shape" [00:08:56 | 00:09:12].
*   **B** for Blastomyces [00:09:16]
*   **H** for Histoplasma [00:09:18]
*   **P** for Penicillium marneffei (Talaromyces marneffei) and Paracoccidioidomycosis [00:09:18 | 00:09:25]
*   **C** for Coccidioidomycosis [00:09:26]
*   **S** for Sporothrix schenckii [00:09:29]

[[cryptococcal_meningitis_and_diagnosis | Cryptococcus neoformans]] is **not** dimorphic [00:07:29 | 00:07:31].

    *   *Aspergillus flavus:* Bright yellow-green colonies [00:35:46 | 00:35:51].
*   **Microscopic Identification (LPCB):**
    *   *Aspergillus fumigatus:* Conidia arise only from the upper part of the vesicle, like fumes rising [00:37:41 | 00:38:20].
    *   *Aspergillus flavus:* Conidia arise from all around the vesicle, like flower petals [00:38:22 | 00:38:48].
    *   *Aspergillus niger:* Maintains its black color [00:37:21 | 00:37:32].
*   **Hyphae Characteristics:** *Aspergillus* species have narrow-angled (acute angle) branching and septate hyphae [00:41:41 | 00:43:02]. This contrasts with Mucor, which has perpendicular branching and aseptate hyphae (also broader and ribbon-like) [00:41:36 | 00:42:41].

### Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP)
*   **Other Names:** Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [00:44:04 | 00:44:10].

### Rhinosporidium seeberi
*   **Clinical Feature:** Causes nasal polyps [00:47:07 | 00:47:12].
*   **Classification:** Historically considered a fungus, it is now categorized as an aquatic parasite or protozoan [00:47:30 | 00:47:48].
*   **Key Identification:** Large, round sporangia containing endospores seen under the microscope [00:48:00 | 00:48:25].
*   **Cultivation:** Cannot be cultivated on artificial media (e.g., SDA) or cell lines [00:48:31 | 00:49:23].

### Candida albicans
*   **Clinical Features:** Can cause endophthalmitis (eye involvement) [00:49:53 | 00:49:56].
*   **Morphology:** Shows budding forms and pseudo-hyphae [00:50:16 | 00:51:00].
*   **Diagnosis:** Reynolds-Brodie phenomenon, also known as the germ tube test (GTT), is positive for *Candida albicans* and *Candida dublinensis* [00:51:21 | 00:52:28]. This test involves incubating a *Candida* colony in serum for two hours, observing the formation of a germ tube [00:51:51 | 00:52:20].

### [[Dermatophytes and Identification | Dermatophytes]]
*   Cause infections of hair, skin, and nails (derma involvement) [00:53:20 | 00:54:35]. Unlike dimorphic fungi, they do not cause systemic infections [00:53:36 | 00:54:14].
*   **Types:**
    *   **Trichophyton:** Infects skin, hair, and nails (all three) [00:55:04 | 00:55:46].
    *   **Microsporum:** Infects skin and hair (thinner like micro/hair) [00:55:49 | 00:56:12].
    *   **Epidermophyton:** Infects skin and nails (ends with 'n' for nail) [00:55:54 | 00:56:17].
*   **Identification (LPCB):** Differentiated by macroconidia (larger structures) and microconidia (tiny dots) [00:57:32 | 00:57:51].
    *   **Microconidia:** Maximum in Trichophyton, fewer in Microsporum, least/absent in Epidermophyton [00:57:54 | 01:00:17].
    *   **Macroconidia (PSC mnemonic):**
        *   **P**encil shape: Trichophyton [00:59:13 | 01:00:29].
        *   **S**pindle shape: Microsporum [00:59:13 | 01:00:35].
        *   **C**lub shape: Epidermophyton [00:59:13 | 01:00:41].

### Tinea Versicolor (Malassezia furfur)
*   **Clinical Feature:** Causes hypopigmented lesions on the trunk (back, shoulder, neck) [01:03:02 | 01:03:34].
*   **Microscopy (KOH Mount):** Utilizes a 10% KOH mount, which digests keratin, making it suitable for skin, hair, and nail samples [01:03:47 | 01:04:47]. Shows a "spaghetti and meatball" appearance (yeast-like dots and hyphae-like strands) [01:05:03 | 01:05:12].
*   **Culture:** Grows on SDA with olive oil, as it is lipophilic (fat-loving) [01:06:06 | 01:06:25], producing a "fried egg" or "sunny side up" appearance [01:05:42 | 01:05:50].

## Fungal Biomarkers
During the COVID-19 pandemic, two fungal markers gained prominence:
*   **Beta D-Glucan:** A normal cell wall component of most fungi [01:07:43 | 01:07:49].
    *   Used for many fungal infections (Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Fusaria, Dermatophytes, Pneumocystis) [01:08:06 | 01:08:13].
    *   **Negative for:** Blastomyces, Mucor, and [[cryptococcal_meningitis_and_diagnosis | Cryptococcus]] (mnemonic: BMC) [01:08:18 | 01:08:44].
*   **Galactomannan:** Particularly used for *Aspergillus* [01:07:50 | 01:07:53]. Primarily used for *Aspergillus* but can be positive in other conditions [01:08:51 | 01:08:55].

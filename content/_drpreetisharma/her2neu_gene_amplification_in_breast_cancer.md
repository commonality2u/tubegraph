HER2neu, also referred to as EGFR2 or erbB2, is a gene implicated in breast cancer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Its role in breast cancer is characterized by [[breast_cancer_types_and_genetic_markers | gene amplification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, where the gene becomes overactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Diagnosis and Testing

### Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Immunohistochemical staining is commonly used to detect HER2neu protein overexpression in breast cancer tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. A positive IHC result typically appears as a brown color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, which is due to the use of the DAB (diaminobenzidine) stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

**IHC Scoring and Interpretation:**
*   **0 or 1+:** Indicates no HER2neu amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **3+:** Confirms significant HER2neu amplification, allowing for targeted treatment like trastuzumab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **2+ (Equivocal):** This score is uncertain regarding amplification, and further testing is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
FISH is the investigation of choice to confirm HER2neu gene amplification, especially when IHC results are equivocal (2+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Normal FISH:** Typically shows two red signals per cell, representing the two copies of the HER2neu gene on chromosome 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Amplified FISH:** Displays multiple red signals within the cells, indicating gene amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### HER2neu in Lobular Carcinoma
In contrast to HER2neu amplified breast cancers, [[lobular_carcinoma_in_situ_and_ecadherin_gene | lobular carcinoma]] (both in situ and invasive) is associated with a downregulation of E-cadherin protein, due to a defect in the CDH1 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Lobular carcinoma classically presents with an "Indian file pattern" of tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This type of cancer can also be bilateral and multicentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

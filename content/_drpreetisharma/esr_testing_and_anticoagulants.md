The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is a blood test that can be performed using various methods, each requiring specific anticoagulants and vacutainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Anticoagulants for ESR Testing

The primary anticoagulant for ESR testing is sodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

ESR can be measured using three main methods:
*   **Manual Methods** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    *   **Wintrobe tube method**: Blood is collected in an EDTA-containing purple vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   **Westergren pipet method**: Blood is collected in a light blue vacutainer, which contains sodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This method typically uses a Westergren pipet for measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Automated Methods**: For automated ESR machines, blood is collected in a black vacutainer, which also contains sodium citrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The difference between the light blue and black vacutainers lies in the technique; the black vacutainer is used directly in an automated machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Other Anticoagulants and Additives

While not specifically for ESR, other anticoagulants and additives mentioned in the context of blood collection include:
*   **Sodium Fluoride and Potassium Oxalate**: Both are found in gray vacutainers for glucose estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Potassium oxalate acts as the anticoagulant, while sodium fluoride is an additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Heparin**: Found in green vacutainers, Heparin is primarily used for arterial blood gas analysis, common in anesthesiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

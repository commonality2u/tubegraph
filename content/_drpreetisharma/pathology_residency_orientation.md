From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

This session aims to orient individuals who have enrolled in Pathology residency, covering what needs to be done from the first, second, and third years, along with discussing resources, app development, and paper writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. It is explicitly for those in the field of pathology, not for NEET PG, INICET, or FMG students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

The speaker, an experienced pathologist, completed MBBS and MD from Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, spending 13 years there, including senior residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Currently, she works with a private lab in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Academic Workload and Practical Experiences in Pathology

Residency is a period of intense learning and practical application.

### Paper Writing During Residency
As a resident, focus on writing different types of papers:
*   **Original Articles** Requires cumulative effort over years, typically 6 years (PG and senior residency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. It's not a quick process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Case Reports** Faster to write and do not necessarily need to be "one in a million" cases; a series of 4-5 cases can be jotted down to offer a new perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reviews** Often undertaken during senior residency, as writing a review is akin to writing a mini-book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. The speaker's favorite review was on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, stemming from a personal interest in genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. She also completed an online course in genetics, focusing on genomics and precision oncology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### Connecting with the Pathology Community
For ongoing support and discussion, residents can join:
*   An exclusive Telegram group for Pathology residency, where the speaker will initiate slide and morphology discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   Instagram, for general interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
The goal is to foster a collaborative environment where residents can share queries, interesting cases, and discuss new advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.

## Resources and Study Materials for Pathology Residents

### First-Year Resident Focus ("New Kids on the Block")
First-year residents, often referred to as "babies," initially struggle with basic tasks like adjusting a microscope or identifying individual cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Focus:** Concentrate on normal histology and hematology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Histology:** *Veters* is recommended for normal histology, though residents should compare with other books recommended by seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Supplement reading with online resources like Google and YouTube to visualize images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Hematology:** *Winthropes*, *WH* (for leukemia/lymphomas), and *Vanes* are suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:27]</a>. For absolute beginners, *Dr. TJ Singh's book* can help with basic cell identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **Microscope Usage:** Prioritize looking at low power (4x or 10x) for diagnosis, as 80% of pathology diagnoses are made at these powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. While high power (40x) is useful for specific details, getting accustomed to low power is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.
*   **Daily Learning:** Pick one topic per day based on the department's common case load (e.g., lipoma, pleomorphic adenoma, gynecological specimens, breast cancers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

### Pathology Study Books (General)
For the main pathology curriculum, the speaker recommends:
*   **Histopathology:** *Ackerman* and *Fletcher* (specifically for tumors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. *Sternberg* is also a popular choice, though not the speaker's personal preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   **Core Theory:** *Robins* is the primary textbook for general, systemic, and hematology pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. Pathology and radiology require knowledge of all body systems, leading to a bulk of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.

### Pathology Residency App Development
A dedicated residency app is being developed with PrepLadder, tentatively launching around May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. It will be available as a standalone pathology app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.
*   **Content Integration:**
    *   Entire *Robins* (General, Systemic, Hematology) will be decoded into short notes, long questions, and viva questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.
    *   [[Advanced Pathology and Microbiology Cases | Systemic pathology]] will include necessary pointers from *Fletcher* and *Ackerman*, essential buzzwords, keywords, and differential diagnoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.
    *   FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) content, crucial for organs like thyroid, salivary gland, and breast, will be integrated from *Orell* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>.
    *   Hematology will cover basics and include all WHO updates for classifications like AML and MDS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>.
    *   Transfusion Medicine / Blood Banking content will be covered, with *Makroo* recommended for its case-based approach, questions, and comprehensive coverage of blood groups and discrepancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.
*   **[[Clinical Pathology Practical Techniques]]**: The second half of the app will cover practical aspects beyond slides, including:
    *   Urine, stool, and semen analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>.
    *   Biochemistry principles (KFT, LFT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>.
    *   Histopathology processor operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.
    *   Various stains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>.
*   The development process is interactive, and resident suggestions are being incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>.

## Future Prospects and Career Options in Pathology

### Key Considerations for Pathology as a Branch
Before choosing pathology, consider two important aspects:
*   **Patient Interaction:** Pathologists generally have minimal direct patient interaction. If direct patient contact and treatment provide personal satisfaction, pathology may not be the ideal branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:00">[22:16:00]</a>. While pathologists are a strong backbone for patient treatment through reports, they often remain "behind the scenes" heroes and may not receive the same direct credit from patients as clinical doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>.
*   **Societal Perception:** Some families and the general public may not fully understand the importance of paraclinical branches like pathology, equating a doctor's identity primarily with clinical roles and a stethoscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>. It's important to be comfortable with this potential lack of external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.

### Career Paths Post-Residency
*   **Government Jobs:** These often involve a waiting period due to forms, seat availability, and state-specific applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>. Teaching experience, such as a senior residency (typically three years or more), is often required for government positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>. This delay is common across medical branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>.
*   **Private Practice:**
    *   Offers a "huge spectrum" depending on the state and personal ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Opening one's own lab:** This can be challenging in saturated metropolitan areas like Central Delhi due to existing chains and funding requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>. However, it can be more economical and practical in peripheral areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Working in private labs:** This is a common path.
*   **Financial Prospects:** Salaries in private labs can range from approximately 1 lakh to 3-4 lakhs per month, varying based on expertise (e.g., additional fellowships in specializations like renal pathology), years of experience, and the state of practice. Periphery locations may offer higher pay due to higher demand for pathologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a>.
*   **Saturation:** While some saturation exists, particularly in metropolitan cities where many doctors prefer to settle, it is a basic level of saturation present across all medical branches and not unique to pathology. Ample jobs are available after completing MD Pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a>.

### Choosing a College and Managing Workload
*   **College Preference:** Decisions often depend on personal state preference (e.g., staying in Delhi) and work culture suitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>. Institutes like Tata Mumbai and AIIMS Delhi are highly regarded but known for very hectic work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>.
*   **Work-Life Balance During Residency:** Pathology residency is generally *not* a 9-to-4 job, contrary to popular belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>. Residents often work from 9 AM until 7 or 8 PM, or even 10 PM to 12:30 AM in some departments, due to daily workloads, grossing, slide reporting, and academic activities like seminars and journal clubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a>.
    *   While hectic, such intense residency experiences lead to becoming a "better pathologist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>. The rigorous training ensures comprehensive exposure and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08:00">[35:08:00]</a>.
    *   The desired work-life balance (e.g., 9-to-5 or 9-to-6:30 PM) typically comes *after* the three years of residency, in government or private practice, where doctors may work in shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:00">[36:35:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Departmental Academics:** If a department lacks strong academic activities, residents must take responsibility for their own learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:20:00">[46:20:00]</a>. This involves:
    *   Consistently reading *Robins* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>.
    *   Reading recent articles, aiming for one per week, to stay updated on immunohistochemical markers, genetic analyses, and new advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:54:00">[46:54:00]</a>.
*   **Post-MD Choices:** After MD, pathologists enter a "wish zone" where they can choose to take a break from studies, focus on work, or pursue further specialized courses like fellowships or certificate courses (e.g., in hepatopathology) based on their interest and areas of weakness during residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:54:00">[40:54:00]</a>. The increasing availability of online courses and webinars makes upscaling more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:30:00">[42:30:00]</a>.

Pathology residency is a tough but rewarding phase that prepares individuals for a stable and fulfilling career with the potential for work-life balance later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[35:51:00]</a>.

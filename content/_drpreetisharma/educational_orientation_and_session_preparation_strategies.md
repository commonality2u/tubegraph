This article outlines the structure and strategies for preparing for medical exams, focusing on pathology and related subjects through "Weekly Wednesday Wisdom" sessions. The guidance is applicable for candidates preparing for exams like NEET PG, INI CET, and FMGE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Weekly Session Structure: "Wednesday Wisdom"

The sessions are named "Weekly Wednesday Wisdom" and occur every Wednesday at 11 AM on the same channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. A timetable is provided until March, with updates for April and May to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

> [!info] Purpose
> These sessions aim to help students finish their syllabus before major exams, including the May IAI CET Exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Session Preparation and Follow-up

To maximize learning, a structured approach is recommended for each session:

1.  **Pre-Session Preparation**:
    *   Read the assigned chapter before the session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
    *   This can be done from main videos or rapid revision (RR) notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
    *   It's advisable to study for two to three days leading up to the session rather than cramming the night before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>.

2.  **Attend the Session**:
    *   Participate in the live session at 11 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   Questions discussed during the session will be converted into polls for later revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   PDFs of the session content will be available later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

3.  **Post-Session Revision**:
    *   Spend approximately 30 minutes to review the discussed topics, particularly image portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   Images are typically located at the end of the rapid revision sections, not in a separate image section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   Quickly review photos from your study materials (e.g., PrepLadder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>.

## Syllabus and Content Focus

The syllabus is structured to ensure comprehensive coverage:

*   **Initial Focus**: Systems (e.g., CVS, Respiratory) are covered first to facilitate concurrent revision of medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Topics**: After systems, the curriculum moves to bacteriology, parasitic infections, virology, and then general pathology and hematology in later months (April and May) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Rapid Revision (RR)**: For pathology and microbiology, Rapid Revision videos combined with live sessions and Q-Bank attempts are considered sufficient, especially for those with immediate exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. Main videos are recommended for students with more time before their exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

## Effective Study and Revision Techniques

*   **Beyond PYQs**: When studying previous year's questions (PYQs), don't just read the answer. Dive deeper into the concept, correlating it with related information (e.g., for Rhabdomyoma, study Tuberous Sclerosis and other cardiac tumors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>. This aligns with [[techniques_and_advice_for_effective_study_and_revision | techniques and advice for effective study and revision]].
*   **[[Active Recall and Study Techniques | Active Recall and Study Techniques]] / Homework**: Small homework assignments are given to encourage active learning, such as preparing a list of PAS-positive substances with their diastase sensitivity/resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
*   **Time Management**: Dedicate specific time slots for subjects. For instance, allocate 3-4 hours on a Monday to complete the target for the Wednesday session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overconfidence**: Do not over-rely on a single word in a question. Always consider the full context and all provided details, especially in image-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Common over Rare**: When faced with a broad presentation, consider common diagnoses first. Sarcoidosis, for instance, is often a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out more prevalent conditions like tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

> [!tip] Staying on Track
> These weekly sessions provide a consistent target to help students stay disciplined and motivated, especially during long preparation periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>.

## Resources and Communication

*   **Telegram Channels**:
    *   **"Pathology by Dr. Preeti"**: A channel for announcements, classes, quizzes, and questions, providing only relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.
    *   **"Pathology by Preeti [Surname]"**: A group for discussion, finding study partners, and general chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.
*   **PDFs**: PDFs of the sessions will be provided after the session concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.
*   **Live Sessions**: These sessions are planned for YouTube due to student requests for live interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.

> [!important] Exam Trends
> Exam bodies like NB (National Board) may adjust the weightage of subjects based on student feedback and perceived difficulty. For example, if students consistently express fear of biochemistry and PSM, these subjects might receive more questions. Conversely, if students are overly confident in pathology and microbiology, their weightage might be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.

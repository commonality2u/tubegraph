[[video_content_related_to_brain_tumors | Brain tumor]] diagnosis often relies on image-based questions rather than purely theoretical ones [1:06:29]. For rapid revision, [[video_content_related_to_brain_tumors | brain tumors]] can be approached using three tables: childhood, adult, and miscellaneous [[video_content_related_to_brain_tumors | brain tumors]], which can be covered in about half an hour [1:06:40].

## Specific [[video_content_related_to_brain_tumors | Brain Tumor]] Types

### Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma (JPA)
This tumor is often seen in children as a cystic lesion in the cerebellum [1:08:01].

*   **Microscopic Features**: Characterized by the presence of pink, fiber-like structures known as Rosenthal fibers [1:08:19].
*   **Genetic Alterations**: May show BRAF V600E mutation [1:08:29], but BRAF fusion is considered more common according to recent Robbins textbooks [1:08:51].
*   **Prognosis**: Has an excellent prognosis, with 100% survival after surgical removal [1:09:14].

### Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
*   **Gross Appearance**: Can present as a butterfly glioma, indicating spread across brain hemispheres [1:09:25].
*   **Radiological Features**: May show serpentine necrosis, appearing like a snake on imaging [1:10:02].
*   **Grade**: It is a Grade IV tumor [1:10:25].
*   **Prognosis**: Associated with a very poor prognosis [1:10:32].

### Oligodendroglioma
*   **Microscopic Features**:
    *   Often described as having a "fried egg" appearance due to a white area within the cells [1:10:39].
    *   Also features "chicken wire blood vessels," which appear like entangled wires [1:10:50]. This feature can also be seen in [[breast_cancer_types_and_genetic_markers | mucinous carcinoma of the breast]] on FNAC [1:11:08].

### Meningioma
*   **Radiological Features**: Characterized by a "dural tail sign" [1:11:35].
*   **Origin**: Arises from the meninges [1:11:40].
*   **Gender Prevalence**: More commonly observed in females [1:11:47].
*   **Microscopic Features**:
    *   Tumor cells exhibit a "whirling appearance," where they go round and round [1:12:10].
    *   Contain round calcifications known as psammoma bodies [1:12:20].
*   **Hormonal Association**: Often positive for progesterone receptors [1:12:41].

## Rosettes in [[video_content_related_to_brain_tumors | Brain Tumors]]

Rosettes are distinctive cellular arrangements seen in various [[video_content_related_to_brain_tumors | brain tumors]]. They can be classified into pseudo-rosettes and true rosettes based on their internal structure.

### Homer Wright Pseudo Rosettes
*   **Appearance**: Characterized by a central pink material or a hidden structure, such as a blood vessel, giving the appearance of a "fake" rosette [1:13:17]. Tumor cells are arranged in a round, rose-petal-like fashion [1:13:22].
*   **Associated Tumors**: Seen in:
    *   Medulloblastoma [1:14:22]
    *   Neuroblastoma [1:14:24]
    *   Ewing sarcoma [1:14:28]
    *   [[retinoblastoma | Retinoblastoma]] (less common for true rosettes) [1:14:37]

### Perivascular Pseudo Rosettes (a type of pseudo-rosette)
*   **Appearance**: Tumor cells are arranged concentrically around a blood vessel [1:15:06].
*   **Associated Tumor**: Typically seen in Ependymoma [1:15:14].

### Flexner-Wintersteiner Rosettes (True Rosettes)
*   **Appearance**: These are true rosettes with a clear lumen (a white, empty center), indicating a "clear heart" or true nature [1:15:55].
*   **Associated Tumor**: The hallmark of [[retinoblastoma | Retinoblastoma]] [1:16:12].

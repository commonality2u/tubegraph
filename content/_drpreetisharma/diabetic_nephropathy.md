[[diabetic_nephropathy_and_kimmelstielwilson_lesion | Diabetic nephropathy]] is a significant complication of [[diabetic_nephropathy_and_kimmelstielwilson_lesion | diabetes]] that affects the [[renal_pathology_and_conditions | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. It is characterized by specific pathological changes within the [[renal_pathology_and_conditions | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

## Pathogenesis and Lesion Composition
The underlying mechanism in [[diabetic_nephropathy_and_kimmelstielwilson_lesion | diabetes]] that leads to these lesions is the glycosylation of proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. The lesions formed are primarily composed of these glycosylated proteins, not glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Key Histological Features
[[diabetic_nephropathy_and_kimmelstielwilson_lesion | Diabetic nephropathy]] presents with a range of characteristic features:

*   **Thickening of the capillaries** One of the earliest changes observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   **Hyaline Arteriolosclerosis** A significant change affecting blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   **Armani-Ebstein Lesion** This involves glycogen deposits within the proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   **Glomerular Sclerosis**
    *   **Nodular Glomerular Sclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson Lesion)** Also known as Nodular Glomerular Sclerosis (NGSS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This lesion appears as pink nodules within the glomeruli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. It is PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) positive, which makes the nodules appear distinctly pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
    *   **Diffuse Glomerular Sclerosis** This occurs when the sclerosis becomes widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.
*   **Capsular Drop and Fiebig Lesion**
    *   **Capsular Drop** Pinkish material is seen dropping from the parietal capsule of the [[renal_pathology_and_conditions | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
    *   **Fiebig Lesion** Small pinkish dots found on the capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.
*   **Renal Papillary Necrosis**
    This condition involves the death of the [[renal_pathology_and_conditions | renal papilla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. [[diabetic_nephropathy_and_kimmelstielwilson_lesion | Diabetes]] is the most common cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. Other causes include obstructive disorders, sickle cell anemia (specifically sickle cell trait) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>, and analgesic abuse (e.g., phenacetin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

### Mnemonic for [[diabetic_nephropathy_and_kimmelstielwilson_lesion | Diabetic Nephropathy]] Features
The mnemonic "DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY" can be used to remember the features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>:
*   **D** - Diffuse Glomerular Sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>
*   **I** - Thickening of the capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>
*   **A** - Arteriolosclerosis (Hyaline) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>
*   **B** - Armani-Ebstein Lesion (glycogen deposits in PCT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>
*   **E** - Nodular Glomerular Sclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>
*   **T** - Capsular Drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>
*   **I** - Fiebig Lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>
*   **C** - Papillary Necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>

*   These features are also PAS positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

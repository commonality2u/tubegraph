The study of [[brain_tumor_microscopy | brain tumors]] in pathology often focuses on image-based questions rather than purely theoretical ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>. For rapid revision, it's recommended to consult tables categorizing childhood, adult, and miscellaneous [[brain_tumor_microscopy | brain tumors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

## Key Brain Tumors and Microscopic Features

### Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma
This tumor is typically seen in children and presents as a cystic lesion in the cerebellum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>.
Microscopically, a key finding is the presence of **Rosenthal fibers**, which appear as pink fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>.
Genetic mutations associated with it include the BRAF V600E mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. More recently, BRAF KIAA fusion is considered more common than BRAF V600E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.
Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma has an excellent prognosis with nearly 100% survival rate after surgical removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.

### Glioblastoma
Known as a "butterfly glioma" due to its characteristic appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>. It is classified as a Grade 4 tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a> and carries a very poor prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>. A key histological feature is **serpentine necrosis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

### Oligodendroglioma
Histological features include a "fried egg" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a> and **chicken wire blood vessels**, which are seen on brain biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.

### Meningioma
On radiology, it often presents with a **dural tail sign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>, as it arises from the meninges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>. It is more commonly seen in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a> and is often progesterone receptor positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
Histologically, tumor cells show a **whirling appearance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>. **Psammoma bodies**, which are rounded calcium deposits, are also a characteristic finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>.

### Rosettes in Brain Tumors
Rosettes are distinctive cellular arrangements seen in various [[brain_tumor_microscopy | brain tumors]].

#### Homer Wright Pseudo Rosettes
These are characterized by tumor cells arranged around a central **pink fibrillar material** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. They are considered "pseudo" rosettes because they lack a true lumen or blood vessel in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.
Homer Wright pseudo rosettes are seen in:
*   Medulloblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>
*   Neuroblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>
*   Ewing Sarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>
*   Retinoblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>

#### Perivascular Pseudo Rosettes
In this type, tumor cells are arranged concentrically around a central **blood vessel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. They are also pseudo rosettes because the central structure is a blood vessel, not a true lumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.
Perivascular pseudo rosettes are seen in **Ependymoma** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.

#### Flexner-Wintersteiner Rosettes
These are considered **true rosettes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a> because they exhibit tumor cells arranged around a clear, true lumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes are characteristic of **Retinoblastoma** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

<div class="callout">
**Mnemonic for Rosettes**
*   **Men are Pseudo**: Homer Wright pseudo rosettes are seen in **M**edulloblastoma, **E**wing sarcoma, **N**euroblastoma, and **R**etinoblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.
*   **Penda (Ependymoma)**: Perivascular pseudo rosettes are seen in Ependymoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.
*   **Flexner-Wintersteiner Rosette**: True rosette seen in Retinoblastoma (representing "true" advice or a "clear heart") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.

The study of [[git_and_liver_pathology | GI and liver pathology]] involves various diagnostic methods and an understanding of specific pathological findings. This includes analyzing patient symptoms, endoscopic and radiological findings, and microscopic examination of tissue biopsies.

## Esophageal Disorders

### Achalasia Cardia
Achalasia cardia is characterized by difficulty in swallowing and regurgitation of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Endoscopy typically does not show gastric or esophageal masses or ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Manometric studies reveal a complete absence of peristalsis and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax upon swallowing, often with increased LES pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

A barium swallow study may show a "bird's beak appearance" due to the unrelaxed LES <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Most cases are idiopathic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, but known infectious causes include *Trepanosoma cruzi*, which causes Chagas disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Herpes can also cause achalasia cardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Chagas disease can lead to megaesophagus and megacolon, characterized by a very dilated esophagus due to obstruction at the lower end and absent peristalsis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Plummer-Vinson Syndrome
This syndrome, also known as Paterson-Kelly Syndrome or Sideropenic Dysphagia, presents with difficulty swallowing and increasing fatigue, often alongside iron deficiency anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Upper GI endoscopy may show an enlarged narrowing in the upper third of the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Mucosal biopsy typically shows no evidence of inflammation or neoplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The dysphagia is caused by esophageal webs, which are simply constrictions or folds of tissue without inflammation or cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Plummer-Vinson Syndrome is a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The classical triad includes sideropenic dysphagia, esophageal webs, and iron deficiency anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Gastric Pathology

### Gastric Carcinoma (Diffuse Type)
Patients may present with abdominal discomfort and dark stools, along with pallor indicative of anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Microscopic hypochromic anemia is often present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Barium swallows can suggest a "leather bottle stomach" appearance, also known as Linitis Plastica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. This refers to a very hard stomach wall due to cancer infiltrating the wall, rather than forming a visible growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

Pathologically, this is known as diffuse gastric cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. It is characterized by classical signet ring cells, where the nucleus is pushed to the side by abundant mucin within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. If Linitis Plastica is not an option, any tumor with "mucin" in its name that involves signet ring cells should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, such as Krukenberg tumor of the ovary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

The most likely genetic alteration associated with diffuse gastric cancer is a mutation in the CDH1 gene, which encodes E-cadherin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. E-cadherin acts as a cell adhesion molecule ("fevicol" or "glue") that holds cells together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. When this gene is mutated, the "glue is gone," leading to tumors with diffuse growth patterns, including diffuse gastric cancer and invasive lobular carcinoma of the [[breast_cancer_pathology_and_genetics | breast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast is also known for its "Indian file pattern" of cell arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

### Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
GIST presents as a firm, smooth, yellowish submucosal ulcerated mass, often in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Biopsy reveals spindle cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, indicating a mesenchymal tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. GIST is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a> and can also occur in the intestines, being more common in the gastrointestinal tract overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

GIST arises from the cells of Cajal, which are the pacemaker cells of the GI tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. The most common mutation in GIST is CD117 (C-KIT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Less common mutations include PDGFR and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), with SDH mutations being more common in pediatric GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
Specific markers for GIST include CD117 (C-KIT) as the sensitive marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a> and DOG1 as a specific marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. CD34 can also be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. CD34 positivity is also seen in endothelial cells lining blood vessels, hematopoietic stem cells, and solid fibrocystic tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

### Bezoars
A bezoar is a mass found trapped in the GI system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   **Trichobezoar:** Composed of hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>, often seen in girls with long hair who consume it (Rapunzel syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   **Phytobezoar:** Composed of plant products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

## Intestinal Pathology

### Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome
This syndrome is characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation (dark spots on the skin and mucosa) and hamartomatous polyps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. The polyps are most commonly seen in the jejunum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Hamartomas are defined by an increase in normal tissue components of an organ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. In Peutz-Jeghers polyps, there is an increase in smooth muscle bands forming an "arborizing" or "Christmas tree" pattern within the polyp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

To confirm if a tissue is muscle or collagen, Masson's Trichrome stain is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. This stain gives muscle a red color and collagen a blue color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.

### Colorectal Polyps
Different types of colorectal polyps have varying malignant potentials:
*   **Hyperplastic Polyp:** Characterized by goblet cells and "serrated crypt architecture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. These polyps are not considered premalignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. The serrations are typically present only in the upper part of the crypts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   **Sessile Serrated Adenoma (SSA):** Also has serrated crypt architecture, but the serrations extend throughout the full thickness of the crypts, including the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. SSAs are considered premalignant lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

## Liver Pathology

### Cholestatic Liver Diseases

#### Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)
PSC is associated with yellow eyes, dark urine, and recurrent fever, often with a long history of chronic diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. Liver function tests may show increased bilirubin (jaundice) with normal ST/LT levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) reveals a "beaded appearance" of the extrahepatic biliary tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.

Microscopically, PSC shows periductal fibrosis around the bile ducts, described as an "onion skin pattern" or "onion peel fibrosis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. PSC is more common in males ("papa") and is associated with P-ANCA antibody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. It is strongly associated with [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | ulcerative colitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. It typically affects younger individuals (around 30 years old) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.

#### Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)
PBC is more common in older females ("amma") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a> and is associated with Anti-Mitochondrial Antibody (AMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. This AMA antibody is specifically directed against the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH enzyme) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

### Metabolic Liver Disorders

#### Jaundice Syndromes
*   **Gilbert's Syndrome:** Characterized by recurrent, mild jaundice that is mostly unconjugated. Patients are otherwise asymptomatic, with jaundice often precipitating during stress (e.g., fever) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   **Dubin-Johnson Syndrome:** Presents with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. Liver biopsy shows a dark, pigmented liver due to the accumulation of brownish pigment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>. It is caused by an MRP2 defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   **Rotor Syndrome:** Also presents with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but unlike Dubin-Johnson, the liver does not show dark pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.

#### Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
This is a genetic disorder that can cause [[git_and_liver_pathology | liver disease]] (jaundice, edema, ascites, decreased albumin, increased ST/LT enzymes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. Liver biopsy in this condition is positive for Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain and is diastase resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

#### Glycogen Storage Disease
This is also a genetic disorder affecting the [[git_and_liver_pathology | liver]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. Liver biopsy shows PAS positivity that is diastase sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>. This means the pink color from the PAS stain vanishes upon adding diastase enzyme because diastase breaks down glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>.

### Other PAS-Positive Materials
Materials that are PAS-positive include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>:
*   Alpha-1 antitrypsin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>
*   Amyloidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>
*   Basement Membrane (e.g., in [[renal_system_and_pathology | kidney pathology]] where it is visualized) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>
*   Colloid in [[thyroid_disorders_and_biopsy_analysis | thyroid]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>
*   Diabetes Mellitus (Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesion in [[kidney_pathology | kidney]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>
*   Ewing Sarcoma (the only bone tumor that is PAS positive due to glycogen content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>
*   Fungus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>
*   Glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>
*   Dysgerminoma and Seminoma (PAS positive due to glycogen content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>
*   Leukemia (ALL, AML M3, M6, M7 - granular dot positivity in ALL, diffuse in M3, M6, M7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>
*   Whipple's Disease (affecting the intestines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>

PAS-positive materials that are **diastase sensitive** (meaning the pink color vanishes when diastase is added) are those containing glycogen, including glycogen itself, Ewing Sarcoma, dysgerminoma, and seminoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. All other PAS-positive materials are generally **diastase resistant** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

### Liver Cancer Metastasis
When cancer is evolving in the liver (metastatic cancer) and retroperitoneum, a biopsy showing neurosecretory granules on electron microscopy points to a neuroendocrine tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. An example is pheochromocytoma, which metastasizes to the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

### Hepatitis

#### Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia
Presents with jaundice that is mostly unconjugated, associated with severe anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. This indicates red blood cell breakdown (hemolysis) leading to unconjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. The condition improves with corticosteroids, suggesting an antibody-mediated disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.

#### Hepatitis B
Serology for Hepatitis B involves testing for two antigens (HBsAg, HBeAg) and three antibodies (Anti-HBs, Anti-HBc (IgM/IgG), Anti-HBe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.
*   **HBsAg** is the first marker to rise in Hepatitis B infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.
*   **HBeAg** indicates infectivity/effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   **Anti-HBc IgM** is a marker of acute infection and is crucial for diagnosing the "window period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.
*   **Anti-HBc IgG** indicates chronic infection or past infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

Mnemonic for progression (L-I-M-I-T for acute, S-E-X-Y for chronic):
*   **L** – HBsAg (first to rise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>
*   **I** – HBeAg (infectivity) <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>
*   **M** – Anti-HBc IgM (window period) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>
*   **I** – HBsAg positive, HBeAg positive, Anti-HBc IgM positive = Acute Hepatitis B of high effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>
*   **T** – HBsAg positive, HBeAg negative, Anti-HBc IgM positive = Acute Hepatitis B of low effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>

*   **S** – HBsAg positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>
*   **E** – Anti-HBe antigen positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>
*   **X** – Anti-HBc IgG positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>
*   **Y** – Chronic Hepatitis B (with HBeAg positivity indicating high effectiveness, negativity indicating low effectiveness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>

[[git_and_liver_pathology | Liver biopsy]] in chronic hepatitis B may show nodule formation and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. Liver biopsy is typically not performed for acute hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>.
Hepatitis B is associated with "ground glass hepatocytes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a> and [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | polyarteritis nodosa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.

#### Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C is characterized by abundant lymphocytes in liver biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.

#### Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH)
AIH is diagnosed in young women with jaundice, where viral hepatitis markers and AMA antibodies are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. Liver biopsy shows lymphocytes and plasma cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>. A key diagnostic feature is the improvement of symptoms with corticosteroid treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.

Pathological features of AIH include:
*   **Interface Hepatitis:** Lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrate the junction between the [[git_and_liver_pathology | liver]] parenchyma and the portal triad/bile duct system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.
*   **Emperipolesis:** Larger cells (hepatocytes) engulf smaller cells (lymphocytes or plasma cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This is the most likely image to be tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.
*   **Hepatocyte Rosettes:** Liver cells are arranged in a rosette-like structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.

Types of Autoimmune Hepatitis:
*   **Type 1 AIH:** Associated with Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANA), Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibodies (ASMA), and Soluble Liver Antigen (SLA) antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   **Type 2 AIH:** Associated with Anti-Liver Kidney Microsome (LKM) antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
    *   **Anti-LKM2** is specifically associated with drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
    *   **Anti-LKM1** and **Anti-LKM3** are associated with Hepatitis C and Hepatitis D, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

Whipple's disease is a condition caused by a gram-positive bacteria called *Tropheryma whipplei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This bacterium typically leads to a condition known as malabsorption, where the intestine cannot absorb nutrients effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Histopathological Features

The classical histopathology of Whipple's disease is characterized by the presence of PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

*   **Foam Cells**: Under the microscope, these macrophages appear whitish and are referred to as "foam cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. They are essentially macrophages that have engulfed the *Tropheryma whipplei* bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **PAS Stain**: To confirm the presence of *Tropheryma whipplei* within these foam cells, a PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) stain is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The PAS stain will turn the whitish foam cells pinkish in color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Differential Diagnosis

When foam cells are observed on histopathology, the primary differential diagnoses include Whipple's disease and Tuberculosis (TB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. To differentiate between the two, an Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) stain can be performed; TB will be positive for AFB, while Whipple's disease will not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

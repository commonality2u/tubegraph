The "Image of the Day" series is an educational initiative conducted across multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, Telegram, YouTube, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is designed to be accessible to a wide audience, providing a valuable resource for learning and revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The series aims to deliver daily content to help participants benefit from concise, focused discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Series Structure

Each session of the [[image_of_the_day_series_on_telegram | Image of the Day series]] typically involves the discussion of one image and one multiple-choice question (MCQ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. On Day 3, the session focused on a single organ, with both the image and the MCQ pertaining to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Day 3: Appendix, *Enterobius Vermicularis*, and Appendicitis

Day 3 of the series covered the appendix, featuring an image related to *Enterobius vermicularis* and an MCQ about appendicitis diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Image of the Day: *Enterobius Vermicularis*

The spotter image provided showed *Enterobius vermicularis*, commonly known as pinworm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, within the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

#### Histopathological Identification

Key features for identifying *Enterobius vermicularis* in [[pathology_image_revision | histopathology]] include:
*   The presence of two lateral cuticular alae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. These are pointed, projected structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Observation within the lumen of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Surrounding appendiceal structures like the lining, goblet cells, and dense lymphoid aggregate can be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

#### Clinical Significance

*Enterobius vermicularis* is often an incidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. It rarely causes appendicitis or acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The classical symptom associated with *Enterobius* is perianal pruritus (itching) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

#### [[Microbiology image recognition | Microbiology]] of Eggs

For [[microbiology_image_recognition | microbiology]], the eggs of *Enterobius vermicularis* are classically described as plano-convex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Inside, they contain a tadpole larva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

The common technique for identifying these eggs is the cellulose tape method or tape preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Different [[microscopy_and_image_identification_techniques | staining methodologies]] can be used to view the eggs:
*   Under ultraviolet light, the eggs appear distinctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   With a Pap stain, the plano-convex shape and tadpole larva are also visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### MCQ of the Day: Diagnosing Appendicitis

The MCQ presented a case of a 17-year-old girl with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and an enlarged appendix, where [[imagebased_medical_pathology_questions | histological features]] showed a dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate in the serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The question asked for the likely diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

#### Differentiating Acute Appendicitis from Peri-Appendicitis

The key to diagnosing true acute appendicitis is the presence of neutrophils in the *muscularis propria* (muscle layer) of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Neutrophils are characteristic cells of acute inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

If inflammation (specifically, neutrophils) is found in the *serosa* (outer layer) of the appendix, it indicates "peri-appendicitis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This means the inflammation is surrounding the appendix rather than originating within its muscle layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Peri-appendicitis suggests that inflammation from a surrounding organ has extended to the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

A common cause of peri-appendicitis in females is salpingitis, which is inflammation of the fallopian tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

In the given MCQ scenario, since the inflammation was specifically noted in the serosa, the diagnosis was acute salpingitis, indicating peri-appendicitis, not acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Perforation of the appendix would also be ruled out because a proper muscle layer would not be visible in such a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

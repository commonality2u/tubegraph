The Camp test is a diagnostic method used in microbiology to identify specific bacterial species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## The Camp Test
The Camp test is primarily used for the [[diagnosis_and_characterization_of_bacterial_infections | diagnosis]] of [[characteristics_and_identification_of_streptococcus_species | *Streptococcus agalactiae*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Procedure
In a standard Camp test, a streak of [[testing_bacterial_cultures_including_catalase_and_coagulase_tests | *Staphylococcus aureus*]] is made, and a streak of the suspected [[characteristics_and_identification_of_streptococcus_species | *Streptococcus agalactiae*]] runs perpendicular to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The *Staphylococcus aureus* acts as the main streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

### Positive Result
A positive Camp test for [[characteristics_and_identification_of_streptococcus_species | *Streptococcus agalactiae*]] is indicated by the formation of an arrow-shaped zone of enhanced hemolysis where the two streaks intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

### Clinical Significance
[[characteristics_and_identification_of_streptococcus_species | *Streptococcus agalactiae*]] is known to cause infections such as meningitis and pneumonia in neonates and infants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. For example, a 3-week-old infant presenting with fever, irritability, poor feeding, and petechial rashes might have meningitis, which can be confirmed using a [[diagnosis_of_bacterial_infections_using_culture_media | blood culture]] and spinal tap followed by a Camp test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Reverse Camp Test
Unlike the standard Camp test, the reverse Camp test is used for the [[diagnosis_and_characterization_of_bacterial_infections | diagnosis]] of *Clostridium perfringens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. In this test, [[characteristics_and_identification_of_streptococcus_species | *Streptococcus agalactiae*]] is used as the main streak, with *Clostridium perfringens* as the test organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## Other Agglutination Tests
Other agglutination tests mentioned include:
*   **Cold Agglutination Test (CAT)**: Positive in *Mycoplasma* infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Standard Agglutination Test (SAT)**: Positive in *Brucella* infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT)**: Positive in *Leptospira* infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

*Vibrio cholerae* is a bacterium known to cause cholera, a disease characterized by "rice water stools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Questions about *Vibrio cholerae* or *Vibrio* are common in examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Toxins Produced
*Vibrio cholerae* primarily produces two toxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>:
1.  **Cholera Toxin (CT)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
2.  **Zonula Occludens Toxin (ZOT)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

Both cholera toxin and zonula occludens toxin are frequently asked about in examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Cholera Toxin Mechanism
The cholera toxin consists of two main fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>:
*   **Fragment B (Binding fragment)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>:
    *   Responsible for binding to intestinal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   Specifically binds to GM1 ganglioside on the surface of intestinal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Fragment A (Action fragment)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>:
    *   Carries out the primary mechanism of action intracellularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   Activates adenylate cyclase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, leading to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Pathophysiological Effect
The increase in cyclic AMP due to Fragment A's action disrupts normal fluid and electrolyte balance in the intestines, leading to the characteristic severe secretory diarrhea, often described as "rice water stools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Identification and Culture
*Vibrio cholerae* can be identified using specific culture media and tests:
*   **Culture Media**: The primary culture media for *Vibrio cholerae* is [[bacteriology_basics_and_introduction | TCBS (Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts Sucrose) agar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   The "S" in TCBS stands for sucrose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, as *Vibrio cholerae* is a sucrose fermenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   Sucrose fermentation results in a yellow color on the TCBS media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   The original indicator in TCBS that changes color is BTB (Bromothymol Blue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **String Test**: *Vibrio cholerae* shows positivity for the string test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

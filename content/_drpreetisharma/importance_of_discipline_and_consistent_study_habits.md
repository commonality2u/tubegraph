For students targeting NEET PG 2025, predicting an accurate exam date is currently impossible due to past uncertainties and postponements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The best approach is to make a comfortable plan and adapt as dates unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This article outlines the [[time_management_and_study_planning_for_exams | importance of discipline and consistent study habits]] to maximize preparation time.

## Developing a Study Plan
A 65-day plan is suggested as a starting point, which can be customized, especially for interns who may need an additional 2-3 days per long subject and one day for short subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The plan balances subjects and includes occasional Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. For those currently not in a comfortable position with their syllabus, three GTs in 65 days is a good start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. If already comfortable, consider doing a GT every 15 days or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### The Challenge of Sticking to a Plan
Making a timetable is easy; the challenge lies in following it consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Success comes from discipline and willpower, not from constantly creating new timetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Key Daily Habits
*   **Daily MCQs:** Dedicate one hour every morning to solve Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) using a custom module that focuses on subjects already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This acts as a mini Grand Test of 50 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
*   **Consistent Medicine Study:** Incorporate 1 to 1.5 hours of medicine video study every day, treating it as a clinical posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This approach breaks down the bulk of the subject and allows for daily integration with other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Fix a specific time, such as 10 p.m., for this study to ensure [[handling_setbacks_and_maintaining_motivation_in_exam_preparation | consistency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

## Effective Revision and Note-Taking
*   **Volatile Topics Notebook:** As you study, highlight volatile topics and note them down in a separate "20th notebook" or "chy copy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This notebook should only contain the names of topics, not extensive text, to avoid becoming bulkier than original notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Personalized Notes:** The volatile topics notebook should be made by you, as everyone forgets different things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. It should also include mistakes made in Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This list of topics will be crucial for the last 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Active Recall:** After initial video viewing for understanding, focus on notes and active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Repeatedly watching videos can lead to overconfidence without true knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

## Approach to Grand Tests (GTs)
*   **GTs as a Guide:** Grand Tests are not just for scores; they are a guide to assess your preparation and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** After taking a GT, immediately perform a subject-wise analysis of incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. Focus on why questions were wrong (factual vs. clinical) and identify weaker subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   **Addressing Weaknesses:** If GT scores are low, the two main reasons are insufficient revision of notes or inadequate [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_previous_year_papers | practice questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Work on these areas, then retake a GT to observe improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Fear of GTs:** To overcome the fear of GTs, consistently give them and allow yourself to make mistakes now, rather than in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Don't focus on the score number itself, but on the analysis of mistakes and time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. If the term "Grand Test" itself is intimidating, consider practicing with "custom modules" or "practice question modules" with timed questions to build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

## Maintaining [[importance_of_confidence_and_positivity | Positivity]] and Balance
*   **Avoid Mental Exhaustion:** With an open-ended preparation period, avoid mental exhaustion. Balance studies with personal life, social media, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Health:** Both [[balancing_exam_preparation_with_personal_health | physical and mental health]] should always be the top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Exam success is important, but health is life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Simplicity of Strategy:** The core strategy remains simple: master your notes and practice questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Avoid overcomplicating things with too many sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

## Getting Started
Begin studying today, not tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. Even if it's just two or three hours, or simply decluttering your study table, start the process now to be prepared to study effectively the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

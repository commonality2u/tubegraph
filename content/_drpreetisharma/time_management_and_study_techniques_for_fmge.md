This article outlines a detailed plan and strategy for students preparing for the upcoming December 2024 FMGE exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The advice is applicable to both first-time test-takers and those who previously scored below 150 marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Overall Strategy and Key Principles

The primary concerns for students are their [[Time Table for FMGE Preparation | timetable]] and overall strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The key to cracking the FMGE exam lies in the number of revisions and daily MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Core Study Guidelines
*   **Single Source**: Use a single source of study material for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Students should determine which faculty and notes they understand best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Video Lectures**:
    *   For subjects where you score above 80% in your Q bank, refer to [[Rapid Revision Techniques for FMGE | Rapid Revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   For weaker subjects or topics (scoring less than 80% in Q bank), utilize main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   Pathology and Microbiology specifically recommend using only [[Rapid Revision Techniques for FMGE | rapid revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
        *   PrepLadder's Pathology [[Rapid Revision Techniques for FMGE | Rapid Revision]] is 19 hours, and Microbiology is 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
        *   Aim to watch approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
        *   Videos can be watched at 1.5x to 1.75x speed (Pathology can even be watched at 2x, Microbiology at 1.5x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## [[60day study timetable for FMGE December 2024 | 60-Day Study Timetable]]

A [[60day study timetable for FMGE December 2024 | 60-day timetable]] is provided, starting from July 24th and concluding on September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. After these 60 days, a revision plan will be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Daily Study Goals
*   **Study Hours**: Aim for 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Consistency is crucial from the beginning to complete the syllabus and enable multiple revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **MCQs**: Practice 100 to 120 MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. If you are not used to this volume, gradually increase your daily count by 15-20 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs)**: Integrate two Grand Tests into the plan. Each GT requires one full day for taking the test and reviewing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Subject Blocks and Allotted Days

### [[Daily routine for effective FMGE preparation | Daily Routine for Effective Preparation]]

A structured [[Daily routine for effective FMGE preparation | daily routine]] is essential to manage [[Time management and study schedule for FMGE | study time]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The concept of "time boxing" involves dividing your day into dedicated study, break, and chill times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

*   **Morning Routine (Before 8:00 AM)**: Dedicate one hour to a relaxing morning routine, including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)**: 3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This duration prepares you for the exam's sitting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Short Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM)**: 30 minutes. Use this time to relax, listen to music, or talk to family, but avoid social media or screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM)**: 1.5 hours for lunch, power nap, and personal screen time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Good Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)**: 1 hour. This can include talking to friends, discussing studies, and using social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM)**: 2 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Nightly Custom Module MCQs (Anytime 9:00 PM - 11:00 PM)**: Create a custom module of 30 mixed-bag questions from subjects already completed. This helps stay in touch with past subjects without serious note-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Chill Time & Sleep (11:00 PM - 7:00 AM)**: Wrap up the day by 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM to ensure 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Revision Plan

The current [[60day study timetable for FMGE December 2024 | 60-day timetable]] covers the initial syllabus completion. After September 21st, a detailed [[Revision techniques for FMGE exam | revision plan]] will be provided, consisting of three phases:
*   Revision 1: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Revision 2: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Revision 3: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

This brings the preparation roughly up to December 15th, with adjustments possible once the exact exam date is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Mindset for Success

Maintain a mindset of "no past guilt, no future anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Your journey starts fresh on July 24th, focusing solely on the 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Tough times are testing, but they pass, making you humble and leading to greater heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. In the long run, clinical skills and humility matter more than the number of attempts to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> This too shall pass, though it might be painful, like passing a kidney stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Embrace the tough journey with humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

This article outlines the key characteristics, identification markers, diseases, and treatments for various protozoan parasites, drawing information from recent quizzes and discussions.

## Balantidium coli
*   **Clinical Presentation** A 32-year-old male presented with bloody loose stools, fever, and abdominal pain after a recent trip [00:09:31].
*   **Identification** It is characterized as a ciliated protozoa [00:10:05].
*   **Characteristics**
    *   It is the largest protozoa known in the human body [00:10:41].
    *   It inhabits the large intestine [00:10:31].
    *   Both the cyst and trophozoite forms are binucleate [00:11:30].
    *   The macronucleus is kidney or bean-shaped, while the micronucleus is a small dot [00:11:52].
    *   The cyst is the infective stage, providing resistance in the environment due to its wall [00:10:53].
    *   It exhibits rotatory motility due to the presence of cilia [00:13:38].
*   **Disease** Causes diarrhea [00:13:06].
*   **Reservoir** The primary reservoir for *Balantidium coli* is the pig [00:13:15].
*   **Treatment** Doxycycline is the recommended treatment [00:13:18].

## Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba coli
*   **Differentiation**
    *   **Motility of Trophozoites**
        *   *Entamoeba histolytica*: Exhibits unidirectional, progressive motility with blunt pseudopodia [00:16:29].
        *   *Entamoeba coli*: Shows sluggish, non-progressive motility with blunt pseudopodia [00:16:38].
    *   **Nuclear Structure**
        *   *Entamoeba histolytica*: Has a centrally placed karyosome [00:17:07].
        *   *Entamoeba coli*: Has an eccentrically placed karyosome [00:17:15].
    *   **Erythrophagocytosis**
        *   *Entamoeba histolytica*: Ingests red blood cells (erythrophagocytosis) [00:18:56].
        *   *Entamoeba coli*: Does not show erythrophagocytosis [00:19:23]. This is an important distinguishing feature [00:19:26].
    *   **Cyst Nuclei Count**
        *   *Entamoeba histolytica*: Typically has 1-4 nuclei [00:19:51].
        *   *Entamoeba coli*: Has 1-8 nuclei [00:19:53].
    *   **Chromatoid Bodies**
        *   *Entamoeba histolytica*: Possesses thick chromatoid bodies [00:20:58].
        *   *Entamoeba coli*: Has thin chromatoid bodies [00:21:06].
        *   Chromatoid bodies are composed of ribonucleoproteins (RNP) [00:21:24].
        *   Both are stained with iron hematoxylin [00:21:42].
*   **Diseases Caused by *Entamoeba histolytica***
    *   In the intestine, it causes flask-shaped ulcers [00:18:07].
    *   In the liver, it causes an anchovy sauce appearance [00:18:17].

## Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba/Balamuthia mandrillaris
*   **Naegleria fowleri**
    *   **Clinical Presentation** Sudden onset fever, headache, vomiting, and motile unicellular microorganisms in CSF after recent diving [00:22:27].
    *   **Transmission** Primarily acquired through nasal entry of contaminated water, such as drain water or during activities like diving, passing through the cribriform plate to the brain [00:23:27].
    *   **Disease** Causes Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) [00:24:08].
*   **Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia mandrillaris**
    *   Both cause Granulomatous Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (GAM) [00:24:51].
    *   **Acanthamoeba**
        *   Infects immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV-positive, AIDS patients, or those on immunosuppression therapy) [00:27:18].
        *   Trophozoites have spikes (acanthopodia) [00:27:54].
        *   Cysts have a wrinkled appearance [00:27:56].
        *   Can also cause keratitis or corneal ulcers [00:29:06].

        *   Infects both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients [00:27:32].
        *   Trophozoites are fish-shaped [00:28:10].
        *   Cysts are smooth-walled [00:28:56].

## Giardia lamblia
*   **Clinical Presentation** Persistent watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and dehydration [00:32:13]. Stool examination may not reveal trophozoites [00:32:24].
*   **Immunoglobulins** Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is associated with *Giardia lamblia* infection, as it is a mucosal antibody present in the GI and respiratory mucosa, acting as a first line of defense [00:31:09].
*   **Diagnosis** String test (Enterotest) is used for diagnosis by retrieving duodenal contents for analysis [00:33:50]. In this procedure, a capsule with a string is swallowed, allowing the string to reach the duodenum and collect samples for analysis when retrieved [00:34:37].
*   **Characteristics**
    *   Often called the "angry old man of the intestine" or "grandpa" due to its appearance [00:32:25].
    *   Trophozoites have two nuclei ("two eyes") [00:35:40].
    *   Possesses four pairs of flagella, totaling eight flagella [00:35:48].
    *   In pathology, the side view of the trophozoite resembles a sickle or spoon [00:37:36].
    *   It exhibits "falling leaf motility" [00:39:20].
    *   Cysts have four nuclei [00:38:34].
*   **Treatment** Metronidazole is the drug of choice [00:40:04]. Tinidazole (2g TD once) is also a practical preferred treatment [00:40:23].

    *   **Culture Medium** NNN (Novy, MacNeal, Nicolle) medium [00:44:57].
    *   **Treatment** Nifurtimox and Benznidazole [00:45:00].

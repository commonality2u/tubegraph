Dr. Preeti Sharma outlines a comprehensive plan and strategy for students preparing for the upcoming [[fmge_december_2023_preparation_strategy | FMGE December 2024 exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This approach is designed for all students, including those appearing for the first time or those who did not achieve a score of 150 in the previous June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Overall Strategy and Timetable

The core of the preparation revolves around a 60-day intensive study period followed by multiple revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### 60-Day Study Timetable (July 24th - September 21st)
This initial 60-day period focuses on covering the entire syllabus, combining theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

*   **Daily Study Hours**: Aim for 8-10 hours of study per day to ensure syllabus completion, which is vital for subsequent revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **MCQ Practice**: Practice 100-120 MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. If you are not currently at this level, gradually increase your daily count by 15-20 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Single Source per Subject**: Adhere to a single source for each subject. Choose notes or faculty that you understand best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision**:
    *   For subjects where you score above 80% in your Q-bank, use [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | Rapid Revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   For subjects/topics where you score less than 80%, refer to main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   For Pathology and Microbiology, it is recommended to use only rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For Pathology, 19 hours of rapid revision is available, and for Microbiology, 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Divide this content to watch approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day, at speeds of 1.5x to 1.75x, or even 2x for Pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Subject Division into Blocks (58-Day Study Plan)
The subjects are divided into four integrated blocks to facilitate better understanding and recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This plan accounts for 58 days of study, with two additional days dedicated to Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

*   **Block 1 (14 days)**:
    *   Anatomy: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
    *   Surgery: 6 days (integrated with Anatomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
    *   Orthopedics: 2 days (integrated with Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
    *   Radiology: 2 days (wraps up the block with imaging studies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   **Block 2 (17 days)**:
    *   Pathology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>

    *   Pharmacology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
    *   Medicine: 6 days (easier after basic sciences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
    *   Pediatrics: 2 days (overlaps with Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
    *   Physiology: 1 day (focus on extra topics from RR/LRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
    *   Dermatology: 1 day (correlates with Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   **Block 3 (8 days)**:
    *   PSM: 5 days (increased due to tougher questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
    *   Biochemistry: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   **Grand Test 1**: After completing the first 15 subjects (around September 8th), take and review your first Grand Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Block 4 (11 days)**:
    *   OBGY: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
    *   Anesthesia: 2 days (wraps up surgical branches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>
    *   ENT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
    *   Ophthalmology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
    *   FMT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
    *   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>
*   **Grand Test 2**: After completing all 19 subjects (around September 21st), take and review your second Grand Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Revision Plan (Post 60 Days)
After the 60-day timetable, a detailed [[revision_techniques_for_fmge_exam | revision plan]] will be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This plan is currently structured into three phases, aiming to conclude around December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:

*   **Revision 1**: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   **Revision 2**: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   **Revision 3**: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

The exact dates for these revisions may be adjusted once the FMGE exam date is confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Daily Routine for Effective Study
A structured [[daily_routine_for_effective_fmge_preparation | daily routine]] is crucial for maintaining focus and hitting the 8-10 hour study target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

*   **Morning Routine (1 hour)**: Wake up and enjoy your morning, preferably with 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air, before starting studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)**: 3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This duration prepares you for the actual exam's sitting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Short Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM)**: 30 minutes. Relax without screens or social media; close eyes, listen to music, talk to family/friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. By lunchtime, you will have completed 5.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM)**: 1.5 hours for lunch, power nap, or personal choice (social media, watching something) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Evening Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)**: 1 hour. This can include a short break and then talking to friends or using social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM)**: 2 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Casual MCQ Practice (9:00 PM onwards)**: Create a custom module of 30 mixed-bag questions from subjects already completed that day. This is a casual test, not for writing or bookmarking, to stay in touch with past subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. It should take around 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
*   **Wind Down (until 11:00/11:30 PM)**: Relax, engage in social media, watch a web series, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Aim for 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Mindset for Success
Maintain a positive mindset by focusing on the present 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Avoid dwelling on past failures ("no past guilt") and do not succumb to future anxieties ("no future anxiety") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The journey will be tough, akin to passing a kidney stone, but remember that "this too shall pass" and better days will come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Embrace the tough times with humility, as they will make you stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. In the long run, clinical skills and humility matter more than the number of attempts it took to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

Customize the [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | timetable]] as needed based on your strong and weak areas, but adhere to the recommended number of days per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Consistency and vigilance are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Esophageal Conditions

### Achalasia Cardia
Achalasia cardia is characterized by difficulty swallowing and regurgitation of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>. Endoscopy typically does not reveal any gastric or esophageal masses or ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>. Manometric studies show a complete absence of peristalsis and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax upon swallowing, along with increased LES pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:25">[02:25:25]</a>. A barium study often reveals a "bird's beak appearance" due to the non-relaxing LES <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>.

Most cases of achalasia cardia are idiopathic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:25">[03:25:25]</a>. However, when a specific infection is the cause, it is most commonly [[Infectious Diseases and Treatments | *Trypanosoma cruzi*]] (Chagas disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>, which can lead to megaesophagus and megacolon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a>. [[Infectious Diseases and Treatments | Herpes]] can also cause achalasia cardia, though *Trypanosoma cruzi* is the single best answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:33">[03:33:33]</a>.

### Plummer-Vinson Syndrome (Sideropenic Dysphagia)
Plummer-Vinson syndrome, also known as Paterson-Kelly syndrome, is characterized by a triad of symptoms: iron deficiency anemia, dysphagia, and esophageal webs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:12">[05:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:03">[07:03:03]</a>. It is common in women and presents with difficulty swallowing and fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:34">[04:34:34]</a>. Endoscopy shows an enlarged narrowing in the upper third of the esophagus, but mucosal biopsy typically reveals no evidence of inflammation or neoplasia as it's just a fold of tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:44">[04:44:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:06">[06:06:06]</a>. This syndrome is a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:47">[06:47:47]</a>.

## Stomach Conditions

### Linitis Plastica (Diffuse Gastric Cancer)
Linitis plastica is a type of stomach cancer that makes the stomach wall very hard, like a "leather bottle stomach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:49">[15:49:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:14">[16:14:14]</a>. Unlike typical cancers that form large fungating growths, the cancer in linitis plastica runs diffusely within the stomach wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:08">[16:08:08]</a>. Pathologically, it is known as diffuse gastric cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:35">[16:35:35]</a>.

A hallmark feature of diffuse gastric cancer is the presence of classical "signet ring cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:50">[16:50:50]</a>. These cells appear like rings because the nucleus is pushed to the side by abundant mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:02">[17:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:22">[17:22:22]</a>. Therefore, any tumor containing mucin and signet ring cells can be related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:42">[17:42:42]</a>. For example, [[Genital system tumors and lesions | Krukenberg tumors]] of the ovary also show signet ring cells due to mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

The most common genetic alteration associated with diffuse gastric cancer is a mutation in the CDH1 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:31">[18:31:31]</a>, which encodes E-cadherin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:43">[18:43:43]</a>. E-cadherin acts as a "glue" holding cells together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:08">[19:08:08]</a>. When this gene is mutated and the "glue is gone," it leads to diffuse cancers like diffuse gastric cancer and [[Genital system tumors and lesions | invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast]] (which can show an Indian file pattern) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:14">[19:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:30">[19:30:30]</a>.

### [[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors and related mutations | Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)]]
[[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors and related mutations | GIST]] is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:24">[21:24:24]</a>, though it can also occur in the intestines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:49">[21:49:49]</a>. It typically presents as a firm, smooth, yellowish submucosal ulcerated mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:28">[20:28:28]</a>. Biopsy reveals spindle cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:38">[20:38:38]</a>, indicating its mesenchymal origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:18">[21:18:18]</a>.

[[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors and related mutations | GIST]] arises from the cells of Cajal, which are the pacemaker cells of the GI tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:08">[22:08:08]</a>.
The most common mutation associated with [[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors and related mutations | GIST]] is CD117 (c-KIT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:31">[22:31:31]</a>. Less common mutations include PDGFR and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:48">[22:48:48]</a>. SDH mutations are particularly associated with pediatric [[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors and related mutations | GIST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:12">[23:12:12]</a>.
CD117 is also the sensitive marker for [[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors and related mutations | GIST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:19">[23:19:19]</a>. Other markers include DOG1 (specific marker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:29">[23:29:29]</a> and CD34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:43">[23:43:43]</a>, which is also positive in endothelial cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and solitary fibrous tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:56">[23:56:56]</a>.

### Bezoars
Bezoars are masses found in the GI tract. A trichobezoar is a mass formed from ingested hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:22">[25:22:22]</a>. This condition, often seen in girls with long hair, is also known as Rapunzel syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:07">[26:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:12">[26:12:12]</a>. If the ingested material is plant products, it's called a phytobezoar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:47">[25:47:47]</a>.

### Hyperplastic Polyp
Hyperplastic polyps are small mucosal nodules, often found in the rectum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:25">[32:25:25]</a>. Microscopic examination reveals increased goblet cells and disorganized crypt architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:39">[31:39:39]</a>, with no signs of nuclear atypia (ruling out malignancy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:45">[31:45:45]</a>.
In hyperplastic polyps, serrations (zigzag folds) are present only in the upper part of the crypts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56:56">[33:56:56]</a>, indicating it is non-malignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:29:29">[34:29:29]</a>. In contrast, in a sessile serrated adenoma (which can be premalignant), serrations are seen throughout the full thickness of the crypts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:55">[34:55:55]</a>.
Mason Tri-Chrome stain can be used to differentiate muscle (stains red) from collagen (stains blue) in polyps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:09">[30:09:09]</a>.

## Related Medical Conditions

### Pernicious Anemia
Pernicious anemia is a type of megaloblastic anemia where the body produces antibodies against parietal cells in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:19">[11:19:19]</a>. Parietal cells produce intrinsic factor, which is essential for vitamin B12 absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:55">[10:55:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:48">[11:48:48]</a>. The patient often presents with fatigue and goiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:27">[07:27:27]</a>, and may have concurrent autoimmune thyroiditis (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis), indicated by elevated TSH and anti-thyroid antibodies with numerous lymphocytes on FNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:40">[09:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:56">[09:56:56]</a>.

*   **Parietal Cells:** These are found in the stomach and appear pink on H&E stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:08">[13:08:08]</a>.
*   **Chief Cells:** These are found in the stomach and appear blue on H&E stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:14">[13:14:14]</a>.
*   **Paneth Cells:** Found in the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:57">[13:57:57]</a>, they can be stained using Phloxin Tartrate stain, which also stains Patterson bodies in Molluscum contagiosum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:10">[14:10:10]</a>.

### [[Peutz Jeghers syndrome and its features | Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome]]
[[Peutz Jeghers syndrome and its features | Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]] is characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation and medium-sized hamartomatous polyps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:40">[26:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:44">[27:44:44]</a>. The polyps are most commonly seen in the jejunum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:35">[27:35:35]</a>. Hamartomas are defined as an overgrowth of normal, disorganized tissue native to the organ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:56">[27:56:56]</a>. In [[Peutz Jeghers syndrome and its features | Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]], these polyps show arborizing (Christmas tree-like) smooth muscle bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:28">[28:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:14:14">[29:14:14]</a>.

### Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)
PSC is a liver condition characterized by yellow eyes, dark urine, and recurrent fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:45:45">[35:45:45]</a>. Imaging (ERCP) shows a "beaded appearance" of the extrahepatic biliary tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:07:07">[36:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:38">[36:38:38]</a>. Histopathology reveals "onion skin fibrosis" around the bile ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:37">[37:37:37]</a>. PSC is associated with P-ANCA antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50:50">[37:50:50]</a> and is more common in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:20">[39:20:20]</a>. It is frequently seen with [[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors and related mutations | ulcerative colitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>.

### Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)
PBC is another liver condition that can be compared with PSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:31">[38:31:31]</a>. PBC is more common in older, typically female patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:43">[38:43:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:05">[39:05:05]</a>. It is associated with Anti-Mitochondrial Antibodies (AMA), which are against the E2 subunit of the PDH enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:56">[38:56:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:50">[39:50:50]</a>.

### Dubin-Johnson Syndrome
This syndrome presents with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, yellow skin, and dark urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:54:54">[42:54:54]</a>. A key pathological feature is a dark pigmented liver due to brownish pigment deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:19:19">[45:19:19]</a>. It is caused by a defect in MRP2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:52:52">[45:52:52]</a>. Unlike Gilbert's syndrome (unconjugated bilirubinemia, precipitated by stress, asymptomatic otherwise), Dubin-Johnson has conjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:12">[44:12:12]</a>.

### Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia
This condition is characterized by jaundice with unconjugated bilirubin, severe anemia, and improvement after corticosteroid treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:06:06">[46:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:09:09">[47:09:09]</a>. The anemia is due to red blood cell breakdown (hemolysis), leading to unconjugated bilirubin formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:51">[46:51:51]</a>.

### Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B serology is crucial for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:01">[49:01:01]</a>. Key antigens include HBsAg (surface antigen), HBcAg (core antigen, not found in blood), and HBeAg (e-antigen, indicating infectivity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:09">[49:09:09]</a>. Corresponding antibodies are anti-HBs, anti-HBc (IgM for acute, IgG for chronic/resolved), and anti-HBe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:37:37">[49:37:37]</a>.
Chronic hepatitis B can lead to cirrhosis (nodule formation in the liver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:39:39">[53:39:39]</a>. Liver biopsy is typically not performed for acute hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:03:03">[54:03:03]</a>. Hepatitis B is associated with polyarteritis nodosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:05:05">[56:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10:10">[56:10:10]</a>.
Ground glass hepatocytes are seen in Hepatitis B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:41:41">[54:41:41]</a>.

### Autoimmune Hepatitis
Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory liver disease that responds to steroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:27:27">[57:27:27]</a>. Serology for viral hepatitis and other autoimmune markers (like AMA for PBC) are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:51:51">[56:51:51]</a>.
Key pathological features include:
*   **Interface Hepatitis:** Inflammation (lymphocytes and plasma cells) at the interface between the portal triad and the liver cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:47">[58:47:47]</a>.
*   **Emperepolesis:** Larger cells engulfing smaller cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:36:36">[59:36:36]</a>.
*   **Hept Rosettes:** Liver cells forming rosette-like structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27:27">[01:00:27:27]</a>.

Types of autoimmune hepatitis:
*   **Type 1:** Associated with ANA (antinuclear antibodies), SMA (anti-smooth muscle antibodies), and SLA (soluble liver antigen) antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07:07">[01:03:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30:30">[01:04:30:30]</a>.
*   **Type 2:** Associated with anti-LKM antibodies (specifically anti-LKM2) and is often drug-induced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53:53">[01:01:53:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04:04">[01:02:04:04]</a>. Anti-LKM1 is seen in Hepatitis C and anti-LKM3 in Hepatitis D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50:50">[01:03:50:50]</a>.

### [[General Pathology and Immunology Topics | Diastase sensitivity in various genetic disorders]] (PAS-positive staining)
Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain is used to identify various substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24:24">[01:06:24:24]</a>. The addition of diastase enzyme helps differentiate between PAS-positive materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54:54">[01:07:54:54]</a>.
*   **PAS-positive, Diastase Sensitive:** If the pink color from PAS stain vanishes after adding diastase, the material is diastase sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25:25">[01:08:25:25]</a>. This indicates the presence of glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32:32">[01:08:32:32]</a>.
    *   Conditions where glycogen is present and thus are PAS-positive and diastase sensitive include: Glycogen Storage Disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07:07">[01:09:07:07]</a>, [[Lung tumors and markers | Ewing Sarcoma]] (a bone tumor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08:08">[01:13:08:08]</a>, and [[Genital system tumors and lesions | Dysgerminoma]] / [[Genital system tumors and lesions | Seminoma]] (genitourinary tumors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13:13">[01:13:13:13]</a>.
*   **PAS-positive, Diastase Resistant:** If the pink color remains after adding diastase, the material is diastase resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12:12">[01:09:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51:51">[01:09:51:51]</a>.
    *   Examples include: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03:03">[01:07:03:03]</a>, Amyloidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37:37">[01:10:37:37]</a>, Basement membrane of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43:43">[01:10:43:43]</a>, Thyroid colloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47:47">[01:10:47:47]</a>, Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions in diabetes mellitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50:50">[01:10:50:50]</a>, Fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18:18">[01:11:18:18]</a>, certain leukemias (AML M3, M6, M7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39:39">[01:11:39:39]</a>, and Whipple's Disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59:59">[01:11:59:59]</a>.
*   Pearls stain is used for iron overload (hemochromatosis), not PAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41:41">[01:06:41:41]</a>.

Spore-forming bacteria include two main genera: *Bacillus* and *Clostridium* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. A key distinction between them is their oxygen requirement:
*   *Bacillus* species are aerobes, meaning they require oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   *Clostridium* species are anaerobes, meaning they do not require oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## [[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]]
[[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] is a spore-forming aerobe known for causing anthrax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### [[types_and_virulence_factors_of_bacillus_anthracis | Virulence Factors]]
The virulence of [[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] is attributed to two primary factors: a capsule and a toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Capsule**: Unlike most bacterial capsules which are made of polysaccharides, the capsule of [[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] is uniquely composed of polypeptide, specifically poly-D-glutamic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Toxin**: The toxin has three components that must work together for its activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>:
    *   **E**dema factor (E) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>: Causes edema by increasing cyclic AMP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   **P**rotective factor (P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>: Helps protect the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
    *   **L**ethal factor (L) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>: Causes killing and destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### Types of Anthrax
There are three main types of anthrax based on the route of entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>:
*   **Cutaneous Anthrax**:
    *   Known as "Hide Porter's Disease," occurring in workers handling animal skins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
    *   Characterized by a blackish lesion called a "malignant pustule" or "eschar," typically found on the neck, shoulder, or upper back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. The term "malignant" refers to its appearance, not cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
*   **Pulmonary Anthrax**:
    *   Also called "Wool Sorter's Disease," occurring from inhaling fibers in the wool industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
    *   Causes pneumonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
    *   Considered an agent of bioterrorism due to its inhalation route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   **Intestinal Anthrax**:
    *   Results from the consumption of uncooked meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

### Lab Diagnosis
[[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] is diagnosed using several [[characteristics_of_specific_bacterial_cultures | cultural characteristics]] and tests:

*   **Diarrheal Type (Diarrhea)**:
    *   Associated with consumption of poultry and vegetables (solid foods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.
    *   Has a longer incubation period (8 to 16 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.
*   **Toxins**: Both types of food poisoning are caused by enterotoxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.
*   **Lab Diagnosis**:
    *   *Bacillus cereus* is motile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[00:18:22]</a>.
    *   Selective media include MAIPA and PEMBA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[00:18:11]</a>.
    *   It is typically transmitted via oral consumption, not parenterally (e.g., via blood or needles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[00:17:59]</a>.

## [[Clostridium species characteristics | Clostridium Species]]
All *Clostridium* species are anaerobes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

### Spore Location
The location of spores within the bacterial cell varies among *Clostridium* species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[00:20:07]</a>:
*   **Terminal Spore**: Located at the very tip of the bacterium.
    *   *Clostridium tetani*: Exhibits a "drumstick appearance" (round spore at terminal end) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>.

*   **Subterminal Spore**: Located slightly away from the tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. This is the most common spore location among *Clostridium* species (e.g., *Clostridium perfringens*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>.
*   **Central Spore**: Located in the exact center of the bacterium (e.g., *Clostridium byfermentans*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>.

### Motility and Capsule
Most *Clostridium* species are motile and unencapsulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>. However, there are exceptions:
*   **Capsulated Species (PCB)**:
    *   *Clostridium **P**erfringens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>
    *   *Clostridium **B**utyricum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>
*   **Non-Motile Species (PMT)**:

    *   *Clostridium **T**etani* (Type 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>

### Clostridium perfringens
*Clostridium perfringens* (formerly known as *Clostridium welchii*) is a major cause of gas gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>.
*   **Gas Gangrene**:
    *   Causes myonecrosis (muscle death) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:59:00">[27:59:00]</a>.
    *   Accounts for 60% of gas gangrene cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>.
    *   Other species causing gas gangrene include *Clostridium septicum* and *Clostridium novyi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.
    *   Can also cause crepitations (crackling sounds) due to gas production at the injury site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>.
*   **Necrotizing Enteritis**: *Clostridium perfringens* can also cause necrosis in the intestine, leading to necrotizing enteritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>.
*   **Lab Diagnosis**:
    *   **Culture Media**: Grown in anaerobic conditions using Robertson's Cooked Meat Broth (RCMB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:36:00">[29:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Hemolysis**: Shows "target hemolysis" or a "double zone of hemolysis" on blood agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Nagler's Reaction**: Positive, due to the production of alpha toxin (lecithinase) which breaks down lecithin in egg yolk agar, resulting in an opaque appearance around colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Reverse CAMP Test**: Positive. In this test, *Clostridium perfringens* (vertical line) synergizes with *Streptococcus agalactiae* (horizontal line) to produce an enhanced zone of hemolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>. (In contrast, the standard CAMP test uses *Staphylococcus aureus* as the vertical line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Litmus Milk Test**: Shows "stormy fermentation" or "stormy clot reaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>.

### Clostridium tetani
*Clostridium tetani* is the causative agent of tetanus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>.
*   **Symptoms**: Characterized by muscle spasms, including "risus sardonicus" (a grinning or smiling expression due to facial muscle contraction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08:00">[36:08:00]</a>.
*   **Toxins**: Produces two main toxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02:00">[37:02:00]</a>:
    *   **Tetanolysin**: Oxygen-labile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:42:00">[38:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Tetanospasmin**: The primary neurotoxin responsible for muscle spasms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>. It is oxygen-stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:53:00">[38:53:00]</a> and acts presynaptically at the neuromuscular junction to inhibit the release of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), leading to uncontrolled muscle contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a>. (This contrasts with strychnine poisoning, which acts postsynaptically) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a>.

### Clostridium botulinum
*Clostridium botulinum* produces botulinum toxin, the most lethal substance to mankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:34:00">[40:34:00]</a>.
*   **Disease**: Causes botulism, characterized by:
    *   Food poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>: Often associated with improperly canned food that appears swollen or contains bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>. Caused by enterotoxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>.

*   **Pathology**: Leads to pseudomembranous enterocolitis (PMEC), characterized by a necrotic, dirty, yellowish membrane on the intestinal mucosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:54:00">[44:54:00]</a>. Microscopically, it shows a "volcano-like eruption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:26:00">[45:26:00]</a>.
*   **Toxins**: Produces two main toxins: Toxin A and Toxin B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:14:00">[44:14:00]</a>.
*   **Transmission**: Spread primarily through oral-fecal route, direct hand-to-hand contact, or fecal contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:12:00">[46:12:00]</a>. It is not spread parenterally (via needles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27:00">[46:27:00]</a>.
*   **Lab Diagnosis**:
    *   Selective media include CCFA (Cefoxitin-Cycloserine-Fructose Agar) and CCYA (Cefoxitin-Cycloserine-Egg Yolk Agar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:44:00">[46:44:00]</a>.

## [[Gram positive bacilli | Gram Positive Bacilli]]: General Characteristics of Enterobacteriaceae

### Motility
Most members of the Enterobacteriaceae family are motile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:49:00">[52:49:00]</a>.
*   **Exceptions (Immotile)**: *Shigella* and *Klebsiella* are non-motile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:53:00">[52:53:00]</a>.

### Catalase and Oxidase Tests
*   All Enterobacteriaceae are generally catalase positive and oxidase negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:06:00">[53:06:00]</a>.
*   **Exception (Catalase Negative)**: *Shigella dysenteriae* type 1 is catalase negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:15:00">[53:15:00]</a>.

### Lactose Fermentation
Enterobacteriaceae are classified based on their ability to ferment lactose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:37:00">[54:37:00]</a>:
*   **Lactose Fermenters (LF)**:
    *   *E. coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:07:00">[55:07:00]</a>
    *   *Klebsiella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:09:00">[55:09:00]</a>
    *   On MacConkey agar, lactose fermenters produce pink colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:48:00">[56:48:00]</a>.
    *   On CLED (Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient) media, lactose fermenters produce yellow colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:54:00">[56:54:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Lactose Fermenters (NLF)**:
    *   Includes *Salmonella*, *Proteus*, *Yersinia*, and most *Shigella* species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:16:00">[55:16:00]</a>.
*   **Late Lactose Fermenters (LLF)**:
    *   *Shigella sonnei* is a late lactose fermenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:41:00">[55:41:00]</a>.

#### Culture Media Indicators
*   **MacConkey Agar**: Contains neutral red as its indicator, which changes color based on pH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:53:00">[57:53:00]</a>.
*   **CLED Media**: Contains bromothymol blue as its indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:26:00">[58:26:00]</a>.

#### CLED vs. MacConkey Agar
CLED medium is considered better than MacConkey agar for culturing samples from urinary tract infections (UTIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:14:00">[59:14:00]</a>.
*   CLED is "less inhibitory" and allows the growth of both [[gram_positive_and_gram_negative_cocci | gram-positive]] (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Candida*) and [[gram_negative_bacilli | gram-negative]] organisms, unlike MacConkey which primarily supports [[gram_negative_bacilli | gram-negative]] growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

### Klebsiella
*Klebsiella* is a lactose fermenter that produces large, shiny, mucoid colonies on culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This mucoid appearance is due to its prominent capsule, which is a key differentiator from *E. coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. If picked, these colonies will stretch, exhibiting a stringy consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. *Klebsiella pneumoniae* can cause pyogenic liver abscesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.

### E. coli
*E. coli* is a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and various types of diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.
*   **UTI Diagnosis**:
    *   A clean-catch, early morning, midstream urine sample is collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
    *   **Kass Criteria**: A diagnosis of UTI is typically made when [[bacterial_anatomy_and_physiology | bacterial]] counts are greater than 10^5 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL (100,000 CFU/mL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
    *   **Exceptions to Kass Criteria**: A count less than 10^5 CFU/mL can still be significant in cases of suprapubic aspiration (direct bladder puncture), [[gram_positive_and_gram_negative_cocci | gram-positive]] organisms (e.g., *Staphylococcus*, *Candida*, as they are not common commensals), or if the patient is on antibiotics or diuretics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.

*   **Diarrhea-Causing Strains of E. coli**:
    *   **Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)**: Causes infantile diarrhea (P for pathogenic, P for pediatric) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.
    *   **Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)**: Causes traveler's diarrhea (T for toxigenic, T for traveler's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
    *   **Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC)**: Causes dysentery (bloody stools) due to its invasive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.
    *   **Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)**: Causes hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a triad of renal insufficiency, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. The most common strain is O157:H7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>.
    *   **Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC)**: Causes persistent diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>. On HEp-2 cell lines, it shows a "stacked brick appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>.

### Proteus
*Proteus* is a [[gram_negative_bacilli | gram-negative bacilli]] that exhibits distinct characteristics:
*   **PPA Test**: Positive (Phenyl Pyruvic Acid test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>.
*   **Dienes Phenomenon**: This phenomenon distinguishes between different strains of *Proteus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. If two different strains are grown on a blood agar, they will swarm towards each other but stop, forming a visible line of demarcation (like "enemies" maintaining distance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:39">[01:24:39]</a>. If the strains are identical, they will fuse without a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:11">[01:24:11]</a>.
*   **Odor**: Has a characteristic fishy odor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.
*   **Urease**: Urease positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.
*   **Swarming Motility**: Exhibits characteristic concentric growth patterns on agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>. Other organisms showing swarming motility include *Vibrio parahaemolyticus*, *Clostridium tetani*, and *Serratia* (PVCS mnemonic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>.

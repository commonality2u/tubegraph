Grand tests (GTs) are a crucial tool in [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | exam preparation]], serving as a guide rather than merely a scoring metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. They indicate the direction for study, helping identify areas that need improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

## Grand Test Frequency and Timing

For students not yet comfortable with their syllabus, starting with three grand tests over approximately 65 days is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. If comfortable with the syllabus, aim for one grand test every 15 days, or even every Sunday for excellent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Giving a grand test after only reading two subjects might seem illogical initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. It's acceptable to focus on reading first and then transition to grand tests by January, especially when seeking to improve reading comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

If you are not comfortable taking full grand tests immediately, consider starting with mixed-bag custom modules of 50 questions from across subjects, completing four such sets in a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>. This acts as a "practice question module" or "mini Grand test" without the mental pressure of a full GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>. Once comfortable with these, then switch to full grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

## [[importance_of_grand_tests_and_how_to_analyze_results | Grand Test Analysis]]

The primary goal of a grand test is not the score, but the analysis of what went wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
Immediately after a GT, conduct a subject-wise analysis on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
Analyze in layers:
1.  **Incorrect answers:** Focus on understanding why these were wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
2.  **Confused answers:** Review questions where you guessed between two options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.
3.  **Correct answers:** Briefly scan explanations to reinforce knowledge, but do not spend excessive time on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

### Identifying Weak Areas

*   **Subject-wise analysis:** Determine which subjects consistently result in wrong answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. This identifies "weaker subjects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
*   **Topic-wise analysis:** Pinpoint specific topics within subjects that are problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Type of errors:** Distinguish between factual errors and clinical errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

## Addressing Grand Test Issues

Based on the analysis, adjust your [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | strategy]]:

*   **Low GT Score despite main videos:** If you've watched all main videos but scores are low, it might be due to a lack of revision, as main videos are bulky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. Either revise your notes or start with [[effective_use_of_rapid_revision_and_main_video_resources | Rapid Revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   **Factual Questions Wrong:** Focus on "mugging up" subjects like Microbiology and Pharmacology, and first and second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. Strengthening these can significantly boost your GT score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Clinical Questions Wrong:** Practice more questions from Medicine and Surgery in your custom module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.
*   **Poor Recall / Notes Problem:** If you have trouble recalling information, it's time to revise your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Time Management Issues:** Practice with a timer while solving MCQs daily, aiming to solve each question in 42-45 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.

### The "20th Notebook" for Volatile Topics and GT Mistakes

Maintain a dedicated "20th notebook" or "chilly copy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This notebook should contain:
1.  **Volatile topics:** Topics you frequently forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
2.  **GT mistakes:** Errors made in grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Crucially, this notebook should *only* contain topic names or brief points, not re-written extensive notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. For example, "incubation periods read from Rapid Revision" or "Hepatitis B graph from Rapid Revision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This condensed list helps in the final 10-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Create your *own* 20th notebook, as what one person forgets differs from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Mindset Towards Grand Tests

*   **Embrace mistakes:** View failing in GTs as a necessary part of the learning process to avoid failing the actual NEET PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.
*   **Don't chase scores:** Focus on the analysis and improvement, not just the GT score number itself, which is a byproduct of the right approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.
*   **Keep it private:** If concerned about scores, keep your GT results confidential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.
*   **Change the label:** If the term "Grand Test" causes anxiety, label it as a "custom module" or "practice question module" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. The problem often lies in the label, not the activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

Ultimately, success hinges on two core components: mastering your notes and mastering MCQ solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

For students targeting NEET PG 2025, creating a study plan is essential, even without a confirmed exam date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While the exact date for NEET PG 2025 is uncertain due to past postponements and uncertainties, students cannot wait for a date to be announced as it might be too close to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The focus should be on making a comfortable plan that can be adjusted later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Importance of a Study Plan

A well-structured timetable provides a roadmap for preparation, ensuring comprehensive coverage and efficient use of time. It demands significant [[Time management and discipline for NEET PG | discipline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Making a timetable is easy, but following it consistently is the toughest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Students should commit to their plan, avoiding the trap of creating a new one every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. While studying, it's important to balance academic pursuits with personal well-being, avoiding mental exhaustion, especially when the exam date is still unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Crafting Your Timetable

A proposed 65-day plan is flexible and can be adapted for various student types, including those taking a drop year or interns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For interns, it's recommended to add 2-3 extra days for long subjects and one day for short subjects to the suggested timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

**General Subject Allocation (Approximate Days):**
*   Anatomy: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   ENT: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   Pathology: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   Microbiology: 4 days (or 15 hours video lectures + QBank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   Other Short Subjects (Dermatology, Anesthesia, Radiology): 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>
*   PSM: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days (including GT analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   OBGY: 6 days (for first, extensive read with MCQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   Ophthalmology: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
*   Pharmacology: 5 days (4 days for subject + 1 day for GT analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
*   Physiology: 2 days (often done in one day as it integrates with other subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. It is recommended to end with physiology as it covers many aspects of other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Working doctors and interns should heavily rely on rapid revision videos, as completing main videos might be impossible if not studying 12 hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Main videos can be referred to for specific difficult topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

### Subject-Wise vs. System-Wise Study

For a first revision or first read, it's advised to study subject-wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. System-wise study is better suited for second or third revisions, as a fresher might miss out on general topics like general pathology, general microbiology, or general pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Integrating Subjects

Instead of studying bulky subjects like Medicine in one stretch, it's recommended to dedicate 1-1.5 hours to Medicine daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This approach makes it less toxic and helps in integration, as you can link Medicine concepts with other subjects being studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This daily session acts as a "clinical posting" in your NEET PG preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This requires significant [[Time management and discipline for NEET PG | discipline]] and a fixed time for medicine study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Utilizing Study Resources

### Rapid Revision vs. Main Videos
*   For subjects like Pathology and Microbiology, rapid revision videos (approx. 20 and 15 hours respectively) are highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   If you've previously used a rapid revision version (e.g., 5.0), stick to it, only checking PDFs for additional topics in newer versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   If you're viewing videos for the first time, go directly for the latest rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   Rapid revision notes are concise and help in faster recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.
*   Passive learning from videos is for initial understanding; subsequent revisions should involve active recall from notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   If you encounter a difficult topic in rapid revision, pause and refer to the corresponding main video for a quick understanding, then return to rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

### Question Banks (QBank)
*   Dedicate 1 hour every morning to solving MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   Use custom modules for subjects that have already been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   After completing one revision of all subjects, the daily 1-hour custom module can become a "mini Grand Test" of 50 questions, touching upon various subjects or alternating between clinical and first/second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   If you've done a round of revision, you can use RR QBank; otherwise, do the full QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   Increasing the number of questions solved daily (e.g., from 40 to 60 or 60 to 80) can improve MCQ management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

### Volatile Topics ("20th Notebook")
As you read, highlight volatile topics and add them to a separate notebook or "Chy Copy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
This notebook should only contain:
1.  Names of volatile topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  Mistakes made in Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
It should not be a bulky rewrite of your original notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This notebook should be personal, as what one person forgets, another might remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The list should be brief, e.g., "Point number one: incubation periods read from Rapid revision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This will be invaluable for the last 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Mastering Grand Tests (GTs) and Analysis

GTs are crucial for evaluating your preparation, not just for scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. For students not yet comfortable with the syllabus, three GTs in 65 days is a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. If comfortable, aim for one GT every 15 days or even every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### GT Analysis
*   Analyze your GT on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   Prioritize analyzing incorrect answers first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
*   Next, analyze questions where you were confused between options or made an intelligent guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.
*   For correct answers, quickly scan through explanations; don't spend too much time on what you already know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   Identify weaker subjects and topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Apps often highlight stronger and weaker subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   Focus on strengthening factual "mugging up" subjects (e.g., Micro, Pharma) as students often lag here, and improving them can significantly boost GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.
*   If scores aren't improving, it might be an issue of MCQ management or attempt strategy, indicating a need to solve more questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.
*   Set a timer while solving MCQs to ensure you answer each question within 42-45 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Grand Test scores are a byproduct of your approach and analysis, not the primary goal. Don't let the "GT" label or fluctuations in scores create undue anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. If you have a mental block with GTs, start by doing custom modules of mixed questions to build confidence, then gradually move to full GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Staying Disciplined

*   **Health First:** Prioritize physical and mental health above everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. An exam can be retaken, but health cannot be regained easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overwhelm:** Don't get stuck in the loop of watching too many videos or constantly switching resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. Stick to one platform for notes and main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. Free GTs from all platforms should be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.
*   **Active Recall:** Once you understand a topic from videos, switch to active recall using your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. Relying solely on passive video watching can lead to overconfidence without true retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.
*   **Address Weaknesses:** If you struggle with subjects like Anatomy, pair them with allied subjects like Orthopedics, Surgery, and Radiology, as they often repeat anatomical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. For factual subjects like Biochemistry, Pharmacology, and Microbiology, revert to "ratta mode" (rote learning) and use active recall by quizzing yourself or a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear Failure:** Confront your fears by taking GTs now. It's better to make mistakes and learn from them during preparation than in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.
*   **Keep it Simple:** The core of NEET PG preparation revolves around mastering notes and solving question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Don't complicate your strategy by seeking too many external sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

It is crucial to start immediately, even if it's just by decluttering your study space and organizing your materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>.

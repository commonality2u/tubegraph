Preparing for and taking exams can be a highly stressful experience, but managing one's mindset and mental state is crucial for success.

## Pre-Exam Preparation and Mindset
It's common to experience increased heart rate and palpitations as the exam approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. To [[managing_mental_health_during_exam_preparation | manage mental health]] effectively, it is advised to wrap up studying by 7:00 or 7:30 PM the evening before the exam to allow for relaxation and a good night's sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Pre-Exam Checklist
Ensure all necessary documents are prepared well in advance, including:
*   Admit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Valid ID proof, ensuring the name matches the admit card without spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   Knowing the exact location of the exam center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>

Reaching the exam center early is important to allow time for your heart rate to return to normal before the exam begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## During the Exam: Maintaining Focus and Positivity
During the exam, several strategies can help [[handling_stress_and_optimizing_study_routines_for_neet_pg | manage stress]] and maintain a positive mindset.

### Avoid Post-Paper Discussions
Between Paper 1 and Paper 2, avoid discussing the exam with others or checking messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Learning about questions you may have gotten wrong can unnecessarily complicate and negatively impact your performance in the second paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Focus instead on light food and drink to maintain energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### "Switch On/Switch Off" Mode
Adopt a "switch on/switch off" mode for each question:
*   **Switch on**: Focus completely on the current question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Switch off**: Once answered, immediately move to the next question without dwelling on the previous one or worrying about future questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This approach helps maintain [[time_management_during_exams | efficient time management]] and reduces overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

### Dealing with Tough Questions
Exams often feature a mix of easy and difficult questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Expect some "bouncers" â€“ 10 to 20 questions that are extremely difficult or unfamiliar, even for experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These questions are not meant to be solved by everyone and are included to maintain a screening level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

*   **Do not dwell**: Focusing on these tough questions is a mistake and can demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Move on**: If a question seems completely out of syllabus, smile, mark an answer (A, B, C, or D), and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. These "bouncers" are tough for everyone, including toppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Focus on easy questions**: Your priority should be to avoid silly mistakes on the easier questions, as these are the ones that matter most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Cultivating a Positive Mindset
*   **Eliminate negativity**: Do not carry negativity into the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Believing bad things will happen can make them happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Count your blessings**: Focus on positive thoughts and believe that nothing bad will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This mindset can normalize your heart rate and prevent silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Overcoming self-doubt**: Many students experience [[overcoming_anxiety_and_staying_motivated_during_fmge_preparation | self-doubt]] and feel they have forgotten everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Trust your knowledge; often, your first gut feeling is correct when not under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Accept human error**: Acknowledge that a few silly mistakes are normal human error and shouldn't be taken too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. However, do not let panic and [[anxiety_and_positivity_management | anxiety]] amplify these errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Confidence and Caution
Maintain high confidence levels until you sit in front of the computer screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, believing your preparation and strategy were the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. However, once the exam begins, shift to a practical and cautious mindset:
*   Read every question and option carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   Even if a question seems familiar, take the time to read it fully to avoid missing any twists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   If unsure, try to rule out incorrect options to arrive at the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   Do not change answers impulsively in the last few minutes due to panic or overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Your first gut feeling is usually right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   The paper will be balanced; some questions will be quick, others lengthy. Don't worry if some questions take longer than 50 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. It will balance out with shorter questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   Acknowledge that the first 15 minutes might feel slower as you settle in, but your speed will pick up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Post-Exam Mindset
Remember that an exam is just one part of life. While important, it does not define your entire worth or future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. True supporters, like teachers and parents, will understand your effort regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Focus on what you have already achieved and the challenges you have overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

# Last-Minute Study Strategies
For [[lastminute_study_strategies | last-minute study]], if you have your own volatile list of topics, stick to that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. If not, scan through images from subjects like pathology, microbiology, orthopedics, and radiology, as these often have classical spotter images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Avoid trying to study extensive new material like medicine in the final hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. The focus should be on light revision and reinforcing existing knowledge.

## Overview
When a peripheral blood smear shows spherocytes, [[autoimmune_hemolytic_anemia_and_diagnostic_challenges|Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia]] (AIA) is the most common cause, especially when no family history is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Spherocytes are red blood cells that are entirely spherical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. In cases like a primigravida patient, antibodies may be responsible for the presence of spherocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Diagnostic Approach
The primary test for diagnosing [[autoimmune_hemolytic_anemia_and_diagnostic_challenges|Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia]] is the Coombs test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Differentiation from Other Conditions
The diagnostic approach for spherocytes depends on the clinical context:
*   If only a blood smear image is presented, [[autoimmune_hemolytic_anemia_and_diagnostic_challenges|Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia]] should be considered first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   If a family history is provided alongside the image, [[hereditary_spherocytosis_testing|Hereditary Spherocytosis]] is a more likely diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

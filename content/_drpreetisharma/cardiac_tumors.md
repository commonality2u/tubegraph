Cardiac tumors are abnormal growths that occur within the heart. These can be primary, originating in the heart itself, or secondary (metastatic), spreading to the heart from other parts of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Classification of Cardiac Tumors

### Secondary (Metastatic) Cardiac Tumors
The most common cardiac malignancy is a secondary, metastatic tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Primary Cardiac Tumors
Primary cardiac tumors originate within the heart. They are categorized based on their nature (benign or malignant) and the patient's age.

#### Benign Primary Cardiac Tumors

*   **In Adults:** The most common primary benign cardiac tumor in adults is the Myxoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **In Children:** The most common primary benign cardiac tumor in children is the Rhabdomyoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

#### Malignant Primary Cardiac Tumors

*   **In Adults:** The most common primary malignant cardiac tumor in adults is Angiosarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **In Children:** The most common primary malignant cardiac tumor in children is Rhabdomyosarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Specific Benign Cardiac Tumors

### Myxoma
*   **Epidemiology:** Primarily occurs in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Location:** Most commonly found in the Left Atrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Gross Appearance:** Appears as a jelly-like mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Features:** Characterized by the presence of lepidic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Rhabdomyoma
*   **Epidemiology:** Most common primary benign cardiac tumor in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndrome:** Strongly associated with [[tuberous_sclerosis | Tuberous Sclerosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, a condition that can also involve intellectual disability and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Nature:** Rhabdomyoma is a hamartomatous tumor, meaning it's an anomalous overgrowth of tissue that is native to the organ in which it arises, but which grows in a disorganized way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It is a skeletal muscle tumor found in the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Features:** Characterized by "spider cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. The white area in spider cells is due to glycogen, making them PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

### Papillary Fibroelastoma
*   **Location:** This tumor is found on cardiac valves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Appearance:** Grossly, it can resemble a "sea anemone" or have a papillary, frond-like structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

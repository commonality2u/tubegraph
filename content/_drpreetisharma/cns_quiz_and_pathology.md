This article summarizes key concepts and image-based questions discussed during a pathology session, covering thyroid, breast, and [[brain_tumors_and_histological_features | brain tumors]] pathology.

## Systemic Pathology Overview
The ongoing "Wednesday ritual" for studying systemic pathology has covered a significant part of the subject over four classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Future topics will include bacteriology and parasitology, supported by daily Telegram quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Stellate Scar Homework
A stellate scar, which appears as a non-enhancing area on a CT scan, was discussed as a homework topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It is seen in several organs:
*   **Kidney**: Oncocytoma and Chromophobe RCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Liver**: Focal Nodular Hyperplasia and Fibrolamellar HCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Pancreas**: Serous cystadenocarcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Breast**: Radial scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Thyroid Pathology
### Non-Toxic Goiter
A 52-year-old woman presented with a symmetrically enlarged thyroid, causing discomfort during swallowing, but no symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This clinical presentation points to a non-toxic goiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Normal Thyroid Histology
*   **Follicular cells**: Line the thyroid follicles and are the origin of most thyroid cancers (papillary, follicular, anaplastic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Parafollicular C cells**: Present in clusters, distinct from follicles, and produce calcitonin. Medullary thyroid cancer arises from these cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Thyroid FNAC Adequacy
For a thyroid FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) to be considered adequate by a pathologist, it must follow the "Rule of 6-10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>:
*   At least **six follicles** should be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   Each follicle should contain at least **ten cells** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

#### Exceptions to Adequacy Rule
The pathologist can still give a report even if the 6-10 rule is not met, in cases of:
1.  **Malignancy**: If malignant cells are observed, a report must be given regardless of cell count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
2.  **Colloid goiter**: If only watery colloid is obtained, it indicates a colloid goiter, and further pricking is unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
3.  **Inflammation**: In inflammatory conditions like [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | Hashimoto's Thyroiditis]], few cells are seen due to thyroid destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

This system for thyroid FNAC reporting is known as the **Bethesda system** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid

    *   Description: Tumor cells arranged radially around a **blood vessel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. Still "pseudo" because there's no true lumen formed by the tumor cells.
    *   Seen in: Ependymoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.

3.  **Flexner-Wintersteiner Rosettes**:

> [!TIP] Lesson from Rosettes
> Just as Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes have a clear lumen and represent a "true" person, seek out "true" people in life who are selfless and give genuine advice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>

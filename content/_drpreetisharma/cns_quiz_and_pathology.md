This article summarizes key concepts in [[pathology_and_microbiology | pathology]] discussed during a Wednesday study session, covering thyroid, breast, and [[brain_tumor_case_study | brain tumor]] pathology, along with general [[key_pathology_concepts_and_revisions | pathology concepts]] and study tips. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

## Session Overview and Study Approach

The session is part of a Wednesday ritual for [[pathology_image_review_for_fmg_exam | pathology image review]] and concept revision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> Participants are encouraged to attempt daily Telegram quizzes for a complete learning experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> The importance of focusing on studies during festivals like Valentine's Day and Basant Panchami is highlighted, with a wish for students to be first-year residents working on duty during future celebrations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

A key study tip emphasized is "discharging a topic" – learning to move on from a topic once the necessary information has been covered, similar to discharging a stable patient from a hospital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>

## Homework Review: Stellate Scars

The session began with a review of homework on structures showing a stellate scar, typically with a central non-enhancing area on a CT scan or a gross specimen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>

Common organs and conditions showing stellate scars include:
*   **Kidney**:
    *   Oncocytoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>
    *   Chromophobe RCC (Renal Cell Carcinoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
*   **Liver**:
    *   Focal Nodular Hyperplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
    *   Fibrolamellar HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   **Pancreas**:
    *   Serous Cyst Adenocarcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
*   **Breast**:
    *   Radial Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

## Thyroid Pathology

### Normal Thyroid Histology
The thyroid gland consists of:
*   **Follicles**: Lined by follicular epithelial cells, which give rise to most thyroid cancers (e.g., papillary, follicular, anaplastic). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   **Colloid**: Pink material within the follicles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
*   **Parafollicular C Cells**: Clustered cells that release calcitonin; medullary thyroid cancer arises from these cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>

### Thyroid FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) Adequacy
For a thyroid FNAC to be considered adequate, it must follow the "Rule of 6/10": <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
*   At least six follicles should be observed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>
*   Each follicle should contain a minimum of 10 cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>

Exceptions to this rule (when a report can still be given despite not meeting criteria): <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>
1.  Presence of malignancy (e.g., papillary carcinoma cells). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
2.  Colloid goiter (mostly fluid, few cells). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
3.  Inflammation (e.g., [[pathological_features_of_various_diseases | Hashimoto's thyroiditis]]), where inflammation replaces cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

Engaging with question banks and Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) is a critical component of [[exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation]], especially for competitive medical exams like FMGE. It is essential to integrate MCQ practice with theoretical study to ensure comprehensive learning and better retention.

## Integrating MCQs with Theory

It is highly recommended to practice MCQs concurrently with theory. Students should not wait to finish all theoretical studies before starting MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Instead, as theory is being studied, MCQs for those topics should be attempted side-by-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This means that if a student is studying four chapters of pathology, the corresponding 20-25 MCQs for each chapter should be solved immediately, rather than setting aside a separate block of time at night for 100 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Daily MCQ Targets

The general recommendation for daily MCQ practice is to aim for 100+ questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. If this number feels overwhelming, students should start with a manageable target, such as 50 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The goal is to gradually increase this number by 5-7 questions daily, aiming to reach the 100-question mark within a week and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

## Sources for Questions

For effective MCQ practice, students should utilize:
*   **Q-banks:** Any existing subscription to a Q-bank platform is sufficient; there is no need to purchase new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs):** Focus on understanding the *topics* from previous years, rather than rote memorizing the questions themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. PYQ topics can be accessed through existing apps or FMG Solutions textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   It is advised to practice NEET PG PYQs from the last three years and AIIMS CET PYQs from the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>.
*   **Image-Based Questions (IBQs):** These are important as they help in quickly identifying questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. While the number of IBQs may fluctuate, they are a consistent feature in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

## Strategies for Question Practice

*   **Quantity over Fixed Numbers:** Instead of focusing on solving a specific number of questions per subject (e.g., 50 for derma, 400 for surgery), concentrate on completing questions for the topics you study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>. The number of questions will vary per topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.
*   **Confidence Building:** The more questions solved, the more confidence is gained. Mistakes made during practice highlight areas needing improvement, helping to prevent "silly mistakes" in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.
*   **Addressing Difficult Topics:** If struggling with a particular topic in a subject (e.g., general surgery, urinary tract infection), pick up a Q-bank and solve as many questions as possible on that topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. Practicing 20 different questions on the same topic can help overcome doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Continuous Practice:** Even in the last 15-20 days before the exam, do not stop solving questions. Continue to solve questions alongside reviewing notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

## Importance of Grand Tests (GTs)

[[importance_of_grand_tests_in_exam_preparation | Grand Tests (GTs)]] are crucial for [[exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation]], especially for the FMGE on January 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. A minimum of five GTs should be taken before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

### Purpose of Grand Tests
GTs serve two primary purposes:
1.  **Time Management:** They help students practice time management, which is critical during the actual exam to avoid running out of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Students need to maintain a pace of 45-50 seconds per question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
2.  **Analysis of Incorrect Questions:** The main focus of GT analysis should be on incorrect questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. For these, read the explanations provided by the Q-bank or solution source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. For correct answers, do not read explanations; instead, review your own notes to reinforce concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

### GT Score Expectations
Do not get disheartened by GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Scores on platforms are often tougher than the main exam to encourage more study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. A score of 150+ in a GT might translate to 170-180 in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. The objective is not to hit a specific score, but to improve time management and learn from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. It is acceptable not to give GTs in the last 15 days to avoid unnecessary tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

## Importance of Revision and Rapid Revision

Consistent revision is key to retaining information. For topics like [[pathology_and_microbiology_mcqs | pathology and microbiology]], rapid revision (RR) videos and notes are sufficient for the FMGE exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. Main videos should only be referred to for clarifying specific doubts that are not clear from rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Daily Targets for Pathology and Microbiology
For [[pathology_and_microbiology_mcqs | Pathology and Microbiology]], daily targets will be provided after the first round of revision (post-December 24th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. These targets will be specific, short (30-40 minutes), and focus on high-yield topics expected in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. This helps in continuous revision of these crucial subjects without them being a separate burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

## Mindset and Self-Belief

It is normal to forget information, even for faculty members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This is a human tendency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Acceptance of this cycle of reading, forgetting, and re-reading is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Maintaining a positive mindset is essential to combat negativity and self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. Students should focus on daily tasks rather than dwelling on the unknown outcome of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

:::info
"Your positivity should scare people, even if they try to come and give you that negative approach, you should give them truth and answer that they feel that you know this person is not going into the negative loop no matter what. That is the kind of confidence and positivity you will have to make as a shield around yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>
:::

Ultimately, success depends on individual dedication and the commitment to follow a structured [[exam_preparation_strategy_for_fmge | study plan]] consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

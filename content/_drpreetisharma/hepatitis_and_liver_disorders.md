Hepatitis and various liver disorders are frequently encountered in pathology, with distinct clinical presentations, diagnostic markers, and histological features. This overview covers key aspects discussed, including specific types of hepatitis, inherited conditions, and important staining techniques used in diagnosis.

## Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B serology involves three antigens: surface (HBsAg), core (HBcAg), and pre-core (HBeAg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. The core antigen does not appear in the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. Corresponding antibodies include anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HBe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.
Five blood tests are typically performed: HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HBe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

### Serology Markers
*   **"LIMIT" Mnemonic (Acute Hepatitis B)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>:
    *   **L** - First to rise is HBsAg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>.
    *   **I** - Next is HBeAg, indicating "infectivity" (high effectiveness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>.
    *   **M** - IgM anti-HBc is a marker of acute infection and the "window period" diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.
*   **"SEXY" Mnemonic (Chronic Hepatitis B)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>:
    *   **S** - HBsAg remains positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.
    *   **E** - HBeAg positive (high effectiveness) or negative (low effectiveness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.
    *   **XY** - IgG anti-HBc is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

### Associated Conditions
Hepatitis B is associated with [[pathology_and_cardiovascular_disorders | polyarteritis nodosa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

### Histological Features
*   **Ground Glass Hepatocytes**: Seen in Hepatitis B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

## Hepatitis C

*   **Councilman Bodies**: Can be seen in most viral hepatitides, but if one must be selected, Hepatitis C is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>.

## [[autoimmune_hepatitis | Autoimmune Hepatitis]]
[[autoimmune_hepatitis | Autoimmune hepatitis]] is diagnosed based on patient symptoms resolving after steroid treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>. Liver biopsy reveals lymphocytes and plasma cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.

### Types and Antibodies
*   **Type 1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>:
    *   Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

## Inherited Jaundice Syndromes

### Dubin-Johnson Syndrome
Characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. Patients often have a history of recurrent jaundice, which can be asymptomatic prior to precipitation by stress like fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
A key diagnostic feature is a dark-pigmented liver due to the presence of brown pigment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. It is associated with an MRP2 defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

### Rotor Syndrome
Also involves conjugated hyperbilirubinemia but the liver shows no pigment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.

### Gilbert's Syndrome
Associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. Patients are typically asymptomatic, with jaundice only precipitating during stressful situations (e.g., fever) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

## Cholangitis

### Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)
Characterized by a "beaded" appearance of the extrahepatic biliary tree on imaging (e.g., ERCP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>. Histology shows "onion skin fibrosis" around bile ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. It is associated with P-ANCA antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a> and [[disorders_of_the_gastrointestinal_tract | ulcerative colitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. More common in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a> and younger individuals (around 30 years old) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.

### Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)
Associated with Anti-Mitochondrial Antibodies (AMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>, specifically against the PDH enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. More common in older females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

## Specific Stains in Liver Pathology

### Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) Stain
PAS stain gives a pink color to specific materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. Its sensitivity to diastase helps differentiate substances:
*   **Diastase Sensitive**: Pink color vanishes upon adding diastase enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. This indicates the presence of glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.
    *   Conditions where PAS is diastase sensitive: Glycogen storage disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>, Ewing sarcoma (due to glycogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>, Dysgerminoma and Seminoma (due to glycogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.
*   **Diastase Resistant**: Pink color remains even after adding diastase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. This indicates other PAS-positive materials.
    *   Conditions where PAS is diastase resistant:
        *   Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>
        *   Amyloidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>
        *   Basement membrane (e.g., in kidney pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>
        *   Colloid in thyroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>
        *   Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions in diabetes mellitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>
        *   Fungus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>
        *   AML (M3, M6, M7 subtypes) and ALL (pink color dots in nucleus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>
        *   Whipple's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>

### Masson Trichrome Stain
Used to differentiate muscle from collagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>.
*   Muscle stains red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
*   Collagen stains blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
For example, in Peutz-Jeghers polyps, smooth muscle bands appear red with Masson Trichrome, confirming their muscular nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

## Other Relevant Disorders

### Achalasia Cardia
Characterized by difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and regurgitation of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Manometry shows absent peristalsis and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax upon swallowing, along with increased LES pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Barium swallow may show a "bird's beak" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Most cases are idiopathic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, but [[parasitic_infections_and_their_clinical_presentations | Trypanosoma cruzi]] (Chagas disease) is a known infectious cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Chagas disease can lead to megaesophagus and megacolon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Plummer-Vinson Syndrome
Also known as Paterson-Kelly syndrome or Sideropenic Dysphagia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Classical triad includes:
*   Iron deficiency anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   Dysphagia due to esophageal webs (constrictions without inflammation or neoplasia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   Glossitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
It carries a risk of [[pathological_features_of_various_diseases | squamous cell carcinoma]] of the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia
Presents with severe anemia and unconjugated jaundice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. Red blood cells break down, leading to increased unconjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. As an autoimmune disorder, symptoms resolve with corticosteroid treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.

### Gastric Cancer (Linitis Plastica / Diffuse Gastric Cancer)
Linitis plastica (leather bottle stomach) is a form of diffuse gastric cancer where the cancer infiltrates the stomach wall, making it hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Microscopically, it is characterized by "Signet Ring Cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, where the nucleus is pushed to the side by abundant mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
The most likely genetic alteration associated with diffuse gastric cancer is the CDH1 gene mutation (E-cadherin protein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Loss of E-cadherin (a "glue" holding cells together) leads to diffuse tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This mutation is also seen in invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

### Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
Most common mesenchymal tumor of the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. GIST is composed of spindle cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. It commonly occurs in the stomach and intestines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. It arises from the cells of Cajal (pacemaker cells of the GI tract) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
*   **Most Common Mutation**: CD117 (c-KIT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
*   **Less Common Mutations**: PDGFR and Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. SDH mutations are associated with pediatric GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
*   **Markers**: CD117 is a sensitive marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. DOG1 is a specific marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. CD34 can also be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

### Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome
Characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation (spots on skin and mucosa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. It involves hamartomatous polyps, most commonly seen in the jejunum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. These polyps are described as "arborizing" or "Christmas tree" polyps, showing an increase in smooth muscle bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

### Polyps of the Colon
*   **Hyperplastic Polyp**: Benign, non-premalignant polyp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>. Characterized by increased cell number (hyperplasia) and "serrated crypt architecture" only in the upper part of the crypts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
*   **Sessile Serrated Adenoma**: Premalignant polyp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. Distinguished from hyperplastic polyps by serrations present throughout the full thickness of the crypts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.

### Thyroid Conditions
*   **Hashimoto's Thyroiditis**: An [[thyroid_conditions_and_pathology | autoimmune thyroid condition]] characterized by numerous lymphocytes on FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. It can be associated with pernicious anemia (autoimmune destruction of parietal cells leading to intrinsic factor deficiency and megaloblastic anemia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Parietal cells are the source of intrinsic factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> and appear pink with H&E stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **De Quervain's Thyroiditis**: Characterized by painful thyroid gland and multinucleated giant cells on FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Other Conditions
*   **Bezoar**: A mass found in the gastrointestinal tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
    *   **Trichobezoar**: Caused by eating hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>, often seen in girls with long hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. Can be referred to as Rapunzel syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
    *   **Phytobezoar**: Caused by eating plant products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
*   **Pheochromocytoma**: A neuroendocrine tumor that can metastasize to the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. On electron microscopy, it shows neurosecretory granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.

Grand tests are a crucial component of [[exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation]], especially for exams like NEET PG. They serve not just as a measure of progress but as a vital tool for self-analysis and improvement.

## Time Allocation for Grand Tests
It is recommended to dedicate half a day for a grand test session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Many students mistakenly allocate an entire day, but effectively, only about three to three and a half hours are spent on the exam itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The remainder of the day often leads to demotivation or "depression" over the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The half-day approach allows for dedicated analysis without dwelling excessively on scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Analyzing Grand Test Results
The primary purpose of a grand test is not just to see your score, but to understand *why* you made mistakes and *where* those mistakes occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Focus on Incorrect Answers
When analyzing, prioritize the incorrect questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Do not spend time reading explanations for questions you answered correctly, as you are already revising those topics through your daily notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. For incorrect answers, delve into the reasons behind the mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>:
- Was it a silly mistake? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>
- Did you genuinely not know the topic? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
- Was the information new or too long? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>
- Did you lack proper time management for that question? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>

This detailed analysis helps tailor your future [[exam_preparation_strategies | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Beyond Statistics
Avoid getting overly focused on statistics like the number of incorrect answers or time taken per question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. While tracking progress is important, the true essence of a grand test is to analyze your learning curve and identify weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Understand if your errors are in:
- Factual recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
- Rote subjects (e.g., microbiology, pharmacology, anatomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>
- Conceptual or clinical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>

## Frequency of Grand Tests
The frequency of grand tests should align with your mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
- **Fortnightly (every two weeks)**: Recommended if you approach grand tests positively, viewing them as opportunities to identify mistakes, manage time, and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
- **Once every three weeks**: Suggested if you tend to get demotivated or depressed by grand test scores, treating them as final judgments rather than learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Mindset Towards Grand Tests
It's crucial to view grand tests as a means to **pick out your mistakes** and **learn [[importance_of_time_management_and_sleep_cycle_for_exams | time management]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. They should not be seen as the ultimate determinant of your NEET PG rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Many students get demotivated by grand test scores, but platforms often make these tests slightly tougher to push students to study more, rather than creating overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.

Giving a grand test as a baseline without judging yourself is a good starting point for a new [[exam_preparation_strategies | timetable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>. The scores provide numbers that can boost confidence once concepts are clear and [[importance_of_question_banks_and_mcqs_in_exam_preparation | question practice]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.

## Integration with Study Plan
Grand tests are integrated into the overall [[exam_preparation_strategies | study plan]], alongside notes and [[importance_of_revision_and_mcq_practice | MCQ practice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. Days marked as "pending" in the timetable can be used either for clearing backlogs or for taking a grand test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This structured approach ensures that testing and analysis are regular components of the [[exam_preparation_strategies | preparation]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

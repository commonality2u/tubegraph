Grand tests (GTs) are crucial for [[approach_to_final_exam_preparation | exam preparation]], serving primarily as a tool for analysis and improvement, rather than solely for judging one's rank or performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Purpose of Grand Tests

The primary purpose of a grand test is to:
*   Analyze your progress graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   Identify your mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   Practice time management for the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   Build confidence through quantitative progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

It's important not to treat a grand test as the final analysis of your potential rank in the NEET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Frequency of Grand Tests

The recommended frequency for taking grand tests varies based on your mindset:
*   **Fortnightly (every two weeks)**: This is ideal if you approach grand tests positively, using them to identify mistakes and manage time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Once every three weeks**: If you tend to get demotivated or depressed by grand test scores, giving them less frequently allows you to develop a more constructive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Time Allocation for Grand Tests

Dedicate half a day to a grand test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **3.5 hours for the exam**: This is the typical duration for giving the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Remaining half-day for quick analysis**: The focus should be on efficient analysis, not prolonged dwelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Analyzing Grand Tests

Effective analysis is key to leveraging grand tests for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Focus on incorrect answers**: Spend time understanding *why* you got questions wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   Identify if it was a silly mistake, an unknown topic, a new concept, or a question where you lacked time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    *   Determine if errors are in factual recall (e.g., microbiology, pharmacology, anatomy) or conceptual/clinical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This helps tailor future [[study_strategies_theory_and_mcq_practice | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Avoid over-analyzing statistics**: Don't get caught up in the number of incorrect answers or completion time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The focus should be on the *root cause* of errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Skip explanations for correct answers**: You are already revising correct topics through daily notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Baseline Grand Test
It is suggested to take a baseline grand test without judgment before starting a structured timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The purpose is to establish a starting point for analysis and track improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. After taking it, review explanations for incorrect answers and then move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## Mindset Towards Grand Tests
It's crucial to cultivate a positive mindset towards grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Do not let grand test results lead to depression or self-blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Remember that GTs are often designed to be tougher than the main exam to encourage more study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. Treat them as a learning opportunity to pick out mistakes and refine [[study_strategies_theory_and_mcq_practice | time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>.

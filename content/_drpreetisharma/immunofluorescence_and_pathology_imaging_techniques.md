[[Medical Microscopy Techniques | Medical microscopy techniques]] and [[Pathology Image Review | pathology image review]] are crucial for diagnosing various conditions, particularly in renal and gynecological pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. These techniques help visualize specific features and deposits that aid in diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## Key Imaging Techniques

### Immunofluorescence (IF)
[[Microscopy techniques Light fluorescent and electron microscopes | Immunofluorescence]] (IF) studies in kidney pathology reveal distinct patterns of immune complex deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. These patterns can be granular (starry sky, lumpy bumpy) or linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>. The technique relies on detecting antigen-antibody complexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>.

### Electron Microscopy (EM)
[[Microscopy techniques Light fluorescent and electron microscopes | Electron microscopy]] provides high-resolution images, showing details of cellular structures and the ultrastructure of kidney components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. It is particularly useful for identifying subtle changes in the basement membrane and podocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.

### Special Stains
[[Staining Techniques in Microbiology | Staining techniques]] are used to highlight specific components within tissue samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

*   **PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff)**: Stains glycogen and other carbohydrates, often appearing pink. It is used to identify [[Kimmelstiel-Wilson_lesion | Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions]] in diabetic nephropathy, which are PAS positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **GMS (Gomori Methenamine Silver)**: Stains basement membranes and fungi black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.

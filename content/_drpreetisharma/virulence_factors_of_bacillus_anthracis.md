[[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]], the causative agent of [[anthrax_types_and_diagnosis | anthrax]], possesses specific virulence factors that contribute to its pathogenicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. These factors enable the bacterium to evade the host immune system and cause disease.

## Key Virulence Factors

The two primary virulence factors of [[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] are its capsule and its toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Capsule

Unlike most bacterial capsules, which are typically composed of polysaccharides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, the capsule of [[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] is unique. It is made up of polypeptide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, specifically poly-D-glutamic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This polypeptide capsule is a crucial virulence factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Toxin

The toxin produced by [[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] is a complex tripartite protein composed of three distinct parts, often remembered by the mnemonic "EPL" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. These three components must work in combination to exert toxic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

The components of the anthrax toxin are:
*   **Edema Factor (EF)**: This factor increases cyclic AMP levels, which leads to edema (swelling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Protective Antigen (PA)**: The protective antigen is essential for the entry of both the edema factor and the lethal factor into host cells, thus providing protection to the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Lethal Factor (LF)**: This factor is responsible for causing cell death and tissue destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

It is important to note that "labile toxin" is *not* a virulence factor of [[bacillus_anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

[[Anthrax and Bacillus anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] possesses two primary virulence factors: a capsule and a toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. These two components are responsible for the organism's ability to cause disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Capsule
Unlike most bacterial capsules, which are typically made of polysaccharides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, the capsule of [[Anthrax and Bacillus anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] is unique because it is composed of polypeptide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This polypeptide capsule (also referred to as poly-D-glutamic acid capsule) is a significant virulence factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Toxin
The toxin produced by [[Anthrax and Bacillus anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] is comprised of three distinct parts, collectively remembered by the mnemonic "EPL" (English Premier League) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. These three components must work together as a combination for the toxin to exert its activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The three components are:
*   **Edema Factor (E)**: This factor contributes to edema by increasing cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Protective Factor (P)**: This component helps protect the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Lethal Factor (L)**: This factor is responsible for causing killing and destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Labile toxin is not a virulence factor of [[Anthrax and Bacillus anthracis | Bacillus anthracis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

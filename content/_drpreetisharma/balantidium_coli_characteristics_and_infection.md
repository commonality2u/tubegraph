Balantidium coli is a ciliated protozoan that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloody loose motions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>

## Clinical Presentation
Infected individuals may present with:
*   Bloody loose motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>
*   Fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>
*   Abdominal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>

A history of recent travel to another city may be associated with the infection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>

## Characteristics and Morphology
Balantidium coli is notable for several distinct [[characteristics_and_diagnosis_of_protozoan_infections | characteristics]]:
*   **Ciliated Protozoa** It is a ciliated protozoa. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>
*   **Size** It is considered the largest protozoa. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>
*   **Affected Organ** It primarily infects the large intestine, causing diarrhea. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>
*   **Nuclei** Both the trophozoite and cyst forms are binucleated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
    *   The large nucleus is bean-shaped. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
    *   The small nucleus appears as a dot. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>

## Infective Stage
Like most parasites, the **cyst** is the infective stage for Balantidium coli. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>

## Motility
Balantidium coli exhibits rotatory motility due to its cilia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>

## Treatment
The drug of choice for treating diarrhea caused by Balantidium coli is Doxycycline. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>

Dimorphic fungi are a group of fungi that can exist in two distinct morphological forms: a yeast form and a mold (or hyphal) form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:05">[07:43:05]</a>. The form they take is dependent on environmental conditions, primarily temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:05">[08:52:05]</a>.

*   **Yeast Form**: Typically observed at higher temperatures, such as body temperature (37°C), within the host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:05">[08:13:05]</a>. The mnemonic "yeast rhymes with heat" helps remember this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:05">[08:24:05]</a>.
*   **Mold Form**: Generally seen at lower temperatures (25°C) in the environment or laboratory cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:05">[08:16:05]</a>. The mnemonic "mold tends to rhyme with cold" helps recall this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:05">[08:29:05]</a>.

[[diseases_caused_by_specific_fungi_and_their_identification | Dimorphic fungi]] are notable for causing systemic infections, often affecting multiple organs, with lung involvement being very common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:05">[11:21:05]</a>.

### [[characteristics_of_different_aspergillus_species | Aspergillus]] Species

Different [[characteristics_of_different_aspergillus_species | Aspergillus]] species can be identified by their colony morphology and microscopic appearance:

*   ***Aspergillus niger***: Forms black colonies and retains its black color microscopically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:16:05">[35:16:05]</a>.
*   ***Aspergillus fumigatus***: Forms smoky green colonies ("fumes and smoke") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:05">[35:32:05]</a>. Microscopically (Lactophenol Cotton Blue stain), conidia arise only from the upper part of the vesicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:41:05">[37:41:05]</a>.
*   ***Aspergillus flavus***: Forms yellow-green colonies ("flowers") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:05">[35:43:05]</a>. Microscopically (Lactophenol Cotton Blue stain), conidia arise from all around the vesicle, like flower petals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:29:05">[38:29:05]</a>.

### Mucormycosis vs. Aspergillosis

These are distinguished by their hyphal characteristics:

*   **Aspergillosis**: Characterized by narrow (acute) angled (<45 degrees) septate hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:05">[40:41:05]</a>. The "A" in [[characteristics_of_different_aspergillus_species | Aspergillus]] stands for acute angle branching, and "SPE" sounds like septate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:05">[41:17:05]</a>.
*   **Mucormycosis**: Characterized by broad, ribbon-like, aseptate hyphae with perpendicular (90 degrees) branching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:36:05">[41:36:05]</a>. Mucor is "motor" (broader) and "ribbon-like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:05">[42:27:05]</a>.

Both can appear pink when stained with PAS stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:05">[40:11:05]</a>.

### Candidiasis (*Candida albicans*)

*   **Identification**:
    *   Displays two main forms: budding yeast cells and pseudo-hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:16:05">[50:16:05]</a>. Pseudo-hyphae are elongated budding forms that appear like false hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:56:05">[50:56:05]</a>.
    *   **Germ Tube Test (Reynolds-Baud phenomenon)**: A key identification method. *Candida albicans* and *Candida dubliniensis* form germ tubes when incubated in serum for two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:41:05">[51:41:05]</a>.

### Dermatophytes (TME: *Trichophyton*, *Microsporum*, *Epidermophyton*)

Dermatophytes cause superficial fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails, collectively known as "derma involvement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:20:05">[53:20:05]</a>. They do not cause systemic infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:10:05">[54:10:05]</a>.

*   **Involvement**:
    *   ***Trichophyton***: Infects skin, hair, and nails (tri for all three) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:41:05">[55:41:05]</a>.
    *   ***Microsporum***: Infects skin and hair (micro = thinner hair) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:09:05">[56:09:05]</a>.
    *   ***Epidermophyton***: Infects skin and nails (ends with 'N' for nail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:12:05">[56:12:05]</a>.

*   **Microscopic Identification (Lactophenol Cotton Blue stain)**:
    *   **Microconidia (smaller spores)**: Abundant in *Trichophyton*, few in *Microsporum*, and absent or rare in *Epidermophyton* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:51:05">[57:51:05]</a>.
    *   **Macroconidia (larger spores)**:
        *   ***Trichophyton***: Pencil-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:12:05">[59:12:05]</a>.
        *   ***Microsporum***: Spindle-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:29:05">[59:29:05]</a>.
        *   ***Epidermophyton***: Club-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:34:05">[59:34:05]</a>.
        *   The mnemonic "PSC" (Pencil, Spindle, Club) corresponds to TME (*Trichophyton*, *Microsporum*, *Epidermophyton*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:27:05">[58:27:05]</a>.

### Tinea Versicolor (*Malassezia furfur*)

    *   **Appearance**: Shows a "spaghetti and meatball" appearance, with yeast cells (meatballs) and hyphae (spaghetti) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
    *   **Culture**: Requires an oil-enriched medium (e.g., Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar with olive oil) because *Malassezia furfur* is lipophilic (fat-loving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. Cultures present with a "fried egg appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>.

## Fungal Biomarkers

*   [[betadglucan_and_galactomannan_testing_for_fungal_infections | Beta-D-glucan testing]]: Detects a normal cell wall component of most fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.

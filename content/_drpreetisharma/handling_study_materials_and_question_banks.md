Effective management of study materials and question banks is crucial for NEET PG preparation. This involves strategic choices between main videos and rapid revision, proper utilization of question banks (Q-banks), and the integration of previous year questions (PYQs).

## Choosing Study Resources: Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision

The choice between main videos and rapid revision (RR) depends on your current level of preparation and the subject matter:

*   **Rapid Revision (RR)**: If you have already covered 85-90% of the syllabus at least once, [[approach_to_final_exam_preparation | rapid revision]] is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. For subjects where you feel confident or that are less "bulky," RR notes and videos can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.
*   **Main Videos**: For "deadly" or "bulky" subjects that account for a significant number of questions, such as Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, PSM, and Anatomy, main videos should be preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. PSM, in particular, may require more in-depth information than RR provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. If you are weak or "scared" of certain subjects (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, [[microbiology_study_and_quiz_preparation | Microbiology]]), main videos are recommended to build foundational understanding and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Customization**: Tailor your approach based on your comfort level with each subject. If you find RR alone insufficient for a particular subject, switch to its main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Interns**: For interns, focus solely on [[effective_study_resources_and_platforms_for_fmge | Rapid Revision]] combined with Q-bank practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

It is important to avoid frequently switching your study source for subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. Stick to one platform or set of notes once you've chosen it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

## Utilizing Question Banks (Q-Banks)

Q-banks are an indispensable part of your preparation, especially when combined with theoretical study:

*   **Integration**: Always do Q-bank practice alongside your notes or video revision. There are no separate "Q-bank days" in the study schedule; practice is integrated daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   **Daily Target**: Aim to solve 100-150 questions per day, slowly increasing your daily target if you're starting with fewer questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. The goal is to reach this target, not to be strictly limited by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Subject-wise Practice**: In the first round of revision, solve questions subject-wise as you study them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Q-Bank Depth**:
    *   **Bulky Subjects**: For "bulky" subjects like Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, PSM, Anatomy, and Pharmacology, try to cover the full Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.
    *   **Short Subjects**: For shorter or less complex subjects, the RR-specific Q-bank might suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.
*   **Building Confidence**: Solving questions provides the "numbers" and objective feedback needed to build confidence, especially after completing your first revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.

## Utilizing Previous Year Questions (PYQs)

PYQs are highly important and should be a focus of your preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>:

*   **Source**: Many online resources and student communities provide compiled PYQs, so you don't need to search for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **NEET PG**: For NEET PG, aim to cover PYQs from the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
*   **INI-CET**: For INI-CET, focus on PYQs from the last three years, as the exam pattern has evolved since it integrated previous individual exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.
*   **FMG**: For FMG students, watching PYQ discussion sessions (e.g., 2-2.5 hour videos that discuss 5 years of PYQs) is a time-efficient way to cover them, rather than solving from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.
*   **PYQ Topics vs. PYQs Alone**: Merely solving PYQs is not enough to achieve a good rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. Focus on understanding the "PYQ topics" in depth and complement this with [[study_strategies_theory_and_mcq_practice | Rapid Revision]] and Q-bank practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

## Managing "Nightmare" Subjects

If certain subjects feel like "nightmares" (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, [[microbiology_study_techniques_for_exams | Microbiology]]):

*   **Confront Your Fears**: Identify your top three nightmare subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. Instead of avoiding them, tackle them head-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
*   **Main Videos & Q-bank**: If rapid revision isn't building confidence for these subjects, go back to their main videos and diligently solve their respective Q-banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Mindset**: Overcoming the fear of a subject is crucial, as it impacts your ability to approach questions correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

## General Study Principles

*   **Balance**: Maintain a balance between reading notes/videos and practicing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Don't just passively read; actively engage with the material through questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
*   **Personalization**: No single timetable or strategy fits everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. [[time_management_and_study_hours_for_exams | Customize]] your study plan based on your strengths, weaknesses, and [[managing_study_stress_and_maintaining_discipline | study patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Practicality**: Be realistic about your study capacity, acknowledging that there will be days for backlogs, emergencies, or anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. The provided timetables include buffer days for this reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.
*   **Focus on Understanding**: Don't just focus on statistics (e.g., number of incorrect answers, time taken). Instead, analyze *why* you got something wrong (silly mistake, new topic, lack of time) and work on those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Concise Note-Taking**: Focus on writing down main buzzwords and key concepts, rather than everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>.

By thoughtfully managing your study materials and question banks, you can maximize your preparation efficiency and build the confidence needed for the NEET PG exam.

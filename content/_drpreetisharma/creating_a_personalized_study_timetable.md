For students targeting NEET PG 2025, creating a study plan is crucial, especially given the unpredictable nature of the exam date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While the exact date is unknown, a well-structured plan allows for effective preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This guide outlines a strategy that is adaptable for various student situations, including those on internship or taking a drop year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Core Study Plan Structure: The 65-Day Approach

A recommended structured plan spans approximately 65 days, aiming to balance subjects and integrate Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This plan is designed for students not yet comfortable with their syllabus, but can be adjusted for those in a stronger position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Subject Allocation (Approximate Days):
*   Anatomy: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
*   ENT: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   Pathology: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   Microbiology: 4 days (with GT and analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   Short subjects (e.g., Derma, Anesthesia, Radiology): 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>
*   PSM: 5-6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days (with GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   OBGY: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   Ophthalmology (OFA): 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
*   Pharmacology: 5 days (with GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Physiology: 2 days (often covered implicitly through other subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>

For interns, it is recommended to add 2-3 days per long subject and one day per short subject to accommodate their schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Key Principles for Timetable Success

### Discipline and Consistency
Creating a timetable is easy, but adhering to it requires significant [[Managing study stress and maintaining discipline | discipline]] and willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Avoid creating a new timetable every day due to backlogs; instead, focus on following the established plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### [[Time management and study hours for exams | Time-Boxing]]
Allocate specific time frames for different activities. This includes dedicated study hours, and time for internship, social media, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This approach helps prevent mental exhaustion, especially when the exam date is not fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Study Material and Approach

### The "20th Notebook" for Volatile Topics
Maintain a separate notebook (or "chy copy") specifically for volatile topics and mistakes made in Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This notebook should contain only the *names* of topics, not extensive text, to serve as a quick reference for the last 14-15 days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. It should be personalized as what one person forgets, another might remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Subject-Wise vs. System-Wise Study
*   **For Freshers/First Revision**: Stick to subject-wise study to ensure comprehensive coverage of general topics in subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **For Second/Subsequent Revisions**: If you have completed the entire syllabus once, a system-wise approach can be effective for integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Rapid Revision (RR) vs. Main Videos
*   **Rapid Revision**: Recommended for Pathology (20 hours) and Microbiology (15 hours) if you've seen them earlier or are short on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. It's also ideal for working doctors who cannot dedicate 12+ hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Main Videos**: Use if you're starting from scratch, or if you encounter a topic in RR that you don't understand, pause the RR video and refer to the corresponding main video for that specific topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. Avoid watching videos repeatedly if you've covered them recently; focus on notes and active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule

A balanced daily schedule should include:
*   **Morning (1 hour)**: Dedicated to solving MCQs from a custom module, focusing on subjects already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This can be a 50-question "mini Grand Test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
*   **Night (1-1.5 hours)**: Dedicated to Medicine videos or notes, treating it as a daily "clinical posting" to integrate concepts and cover the bulk of the subject over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Fix a specific time for this (e.g., 10 PM) and adhere to it strictly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

## Grand Test (GT) Strategy and Analysis

GTs are not merely for scores but serve as a crucial guide for your study direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

### GT Analysis
*   **Same-Day Analysis**: Analyze your GT on the same day it's given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   **Layered Analysis**:
    1.  **Incorrects**: Focus on understanding why you got them wrong.
    2.  **Confused Questions**: Analyze questions where you were torn between options or made an intelligent guess.
    3.  **Corrects**: Briefly scan explanations for correct answers to reinforce knowledge, but don't spend excessive time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.
*   **Identify Weaknesses**: The GT will highlight your stronger and weaker subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. If factual subjects (e.g., Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology) are weak, prioritize strengthening them, as this often leads to higher GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

### Improving GT Scores
*   **Address Weak Subjects**: If a subject is consistently weak, revisit its notes and do topic-wise practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
*   **Increase MCQ Practice**: If time management or MCQ attempt strategy is an issue, increase the number of questions solved daily (e.g., from 40 to 60, or 60 to 80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
*   **Revise Notes**: If recall is a problem, it's time to revise your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   **[[Time management and study scheduling | Time Management]] during MCQs**: Practice with a timer to ensure you can solve questions within the required time (42-45 seconds per question) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.

### Overcoming GT Fear
Many students fear GTs. To combat this, you can:
*   **Practice Frequently**: The more you face your fears, the less intimidating they become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Change the Label**: If the term "Grand Test" causes anxiety, call your timed practice sessions "custom modules" or "practice question modules" instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.
*   **Focus on Analysis, Not Score**: The score is a byproduct of your approach; focus on understanding your mistakes and improving, rather than the number itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. Keep your GT scores private if it helps manage pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

## Revisions and Long-Term Strategy

*   **First Reading**: Should be comprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Revisions**: Gradually narrow down the material, moving from full notes to rapid revision, and finally to filtered/volatile topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. The "20th notebook" is crucial for these later, faster revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   The number of revisions will depend on the exam date, but the goal is to master notes and MCQ solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

## Customization and Final Advice

This [[Effective time table creation for FMGE | timetable]] is a general guideline and must be customized to your personal circumstances, including your job, internship schedule, and existing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

Start your preparation today, not tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Even if it's just for a few hours, begin by organizing your study space and materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

The period leading up to and during an exam, such as the FMG exam, often brings significant anxiety and panic, characterized by increased heart rate and palpitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This session focuses on practical advice for managing these feelings and approaching the exam with a positive mindset.

## Pre-Exam Day Preparation

*   **Winding Down and Sleep**
    It is advised to wrap up studying by 7:00 or 7:30 PM on the evening before the exam to allow time to settle down and ensure a [[importance_of_time_management_and_sleep_cycle_for_exams | good night's sleep]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **[[essential_exam_day_checklist_for_fmge | Exam Day Checklist]]**
    Ensure your admit card is ready and a valid ID proof is with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Double-check that the name on the ID proof matches the name on the admit card to avoid spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. A photograph does not need to be pasted on the admit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Keep your ID in an easily accessible place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Exam Centre Location**
    Confirm the exact location of your exam centre beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Strategies for Exam Day

*   **Timely Arrival**
    Entry for Paper One begins at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Do not arrive at the last minute; ensure you reach in time to allow your heart rate to return to normal before the exam begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **During the Break Between Papers**
    Avoid discussing Paper One with others or checking messages during the break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Discussion of questions can cause unnecessary [[dealing_with_anxiety_and_maintaining_positivity | anxiety]] or make the second paper more difficult if you discover mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Focus instead on light food and drink that provides energy for Paper Two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Handling Paper Difficulty**
    Historically, one paper tends to be easier and the other more difficult, rather than both being average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. If Paper One feels challenging, do not lose hope, as Paper Two might be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The goal is to clear the average score of 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **"Switch On, Switch Off" Mode for Questions**
    Approach each question individually: "switch on," attempt the question, then "switch off" and move to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Do not dwell on previous questions or anticipate future ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Dealing with "Bouncer" Questions**
    Expect 10-20 "bouncer" questions in each paper that even experts may find challenging or unfamiliar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These questions are not meant to be solved by everyone and are included to maintain the screening level of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Do not focus on them, as they can demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. If you encounter such questions, simply make an educated guess (A, B, C, or D), "think of God," and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Silly Mistakes**
    The main focus should be on not making silly mistakes on easier questions rather than trying to solve tough ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Silly mistakes can lead to long-term regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Power of [[dealing_with_anxiety_and_maintaining_positivity | Positivity]] and Self-Belief**
    Maintain a positive mindset, believing that "paper is going to be easy" and "nothing bad is going to happen to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This mindset helps normalize heart rate and prevents silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Avoid negative thoughts like "I have forgotten everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

    > "From right now till tomorrow till the end of the exam you do not have to think of anything negative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut Feeling; Avoid Overthinking**
    When analyzing a question, spend about 45 seconds, mark the answer, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Do not change answers in the last 15 minutes due to [[handling_exam_anxiety_and_motivation_tactics | panic]] or overthinking, as your first gut feeling is often correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Confidence vs. Overconfidence**
    It's good to be confident, but avoid making silly mistakes due to overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. By 8:30 AM on exam day, be "super confident" that your preparation, strategy, teachers, and sources were the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This confidence helps you reach the hall, but once seated, switch to a sane and practical mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Read Questions Carefully**
    Even if a question seems familiar, take the time (around 20 seconds) to read the entire question and all options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This prevents missing crucial twists and regretting it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   **Pacing and Balance**
    Some questions will be one-liners, others lengthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Don't worry if a lengthy question takes more than 50 seconds; one-liners or image-based questions will balance out the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. A slight lag in the first 15 minutes is normal as you settle in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Overcoming Negativity and Self-Doubt

*   **Count Your Blessings and Believe**
    After all the hard work (rapid [[effective_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revisions]], notes, images, PYQs), it's time to count your blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Believe in whatever gives you [[role_of_faith_and_belief_in_exam_success | faith]]â€”God, the universe, energy, or the blessings of your parents and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Ignore External Judgment**
    Do not be concerned about what others, who are not true supporters, might say if you don't clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Your teachers and parents, who know your hard work, will stand by you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Perspective on Exams**
    While the exam feels important now, it's just one part of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. You are already considered a doctor in terms of your knowledge and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. The exam is merely a formality, a legal process for official certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

    > "This one five line ka question is not a challenge that should bother you so much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

    It is normal to make a few silly mistakes; they are part of human error and should not be taken too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. The key is to prevent panic and [[handling_exam_anxiety_and_motivation_tactics | anxiety]] from amplifying these errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Last-Minute [[exam_preparation_strategies | Study Advice]]

If you have your own volatile list to revise, stick to that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Otherwise, scan images from subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Orthopedics, and Radiology, as they often have classical spotter images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It's advised to stop studying after 8:00 PM on the day before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

Remember to maintain a smile and face every challenge. "Paper one howsoever will go Paper two howsoever will go till 5:00 pm we will not cry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

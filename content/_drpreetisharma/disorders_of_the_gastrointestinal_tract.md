This article provides an overview of various gastrointestinal disorders, including esophageal, gastric, and intestinal conditions, as well as associated liver and systemic pathologies that present with gastrointestinal symptoms or findings.

## Esophageal Disorders

### Achalasia Cardia
Achalasia cardia is characterized by difficulty swallowing and regurgitation of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>. Endoscopy typically does not reveal gastric or esophageal abnormalities, ruling out cancer or ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:47">[02:21:47]</a>. Manometric studies show complete absence of peristalsis and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax upon swallowing, with increased pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:43">[02:28:43]</a>. A barium study may show a "bird's beak appearance" due to the unrelaxed lower esophageal sphincter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>.

While most cases are idiopathic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, [[Parasitic infections and their clinical presentations | *Trypanosoma cruzi*]] (causing Chagas disease) is a known infectious cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>. Herpes can also cause achalasia cardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:14">[03:33:14]</a>. In Chagas disease, the esophagus can become dilated and "megaesophagus" due to obstruction at the lower end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:23">[04:00:23]</a>. Peristalsis is absent in achalasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

### Plummer-Vinson Syndrome (Paterson-Brown-Kelly Syndrome, Sideropenic Dysphagia)
This syndrome is characterized by difficulty swallowing and fatigue, often presenting with iron deficiency anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:25">[04:34:25]</a>. Upper GI endoscopy may show enlarged narrowing in the upper third of the esophagus, with mucosal biopsies showing no inflammation or neoplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. The "medicine-related" name for this condition is Sideropenic Dysphagia, referring to iron deficiency and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. It is associated with esophageal webs, which are constrictions without inflammation or cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Patients with Plummer-Vinson Syndrome are at risk for developing squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. The classical triad includes iron deficiency anemia, dysphagia, and esophageal webs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

## Gastric Disorders

### Gastric Cancer
Gastric cancer can manifest with abdominal distension, dark stools, pallor, and microcytic hypochromic anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. Barium swallows may reveal "linitis plastica" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.

#### Linitis Plastica
Linitis plastica, also known as "leather bottle stomach," refers to a diffuse thickening and hardening of the stomach wall due to cancer infiltrating the wall, rather than forming a fungating mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

#### Diffuse Gastric Cancer and Signet Ring Cells
Pathologically, linitis plastica is classified as diffuse gastric cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>. A characteristic feature is the presence of classical "signet ring cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. These cells appear like rings because the nucleus is pushed to the side by abundant mucin within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>. Tumors containing mucin often present with signet ring cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.

#### Genetic Alterations
The most common genetic alteration in diffuse gastric cancer is mutations in the CDH1 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. CDH1 codes for E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule that acts as a "glue" holding cells together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>. When this "glue" is lost, cells become less adherent, leading to infiltrative tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. Cancers associated with E-cadherin loss include diffuse gastric cancer and invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>. Invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast is also known for its "Indian file pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

### [[Pathogenesis and Markers of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors | Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST)]]
[[Pathogenesis and Markers of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors | GIST]] can present with upper GI pain and dark stools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>. Endoscopy may show a firm, smooth, yellowish sub-mucosal ulcerated mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>. Biopsy reveals spindle cells, indicating a mesenchymal origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.
[[Pathogenesis and Markers of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors | GIST]] is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. It can occur in both the stomach and intestines, being more common in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>. [[Pathogenesis and Markers of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors | GIST]] arises from the cells of Cajal, which are the pacemaker cells of the GI tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>.

#### Genetic Mutations and Markers
The most common mutation in [[Pathogenesis and Markers of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors | GIST]] is CD117 (also known as c-KIT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>. Less common mutations include PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. SDH mutations are particularly associated with pediatric [[Pathogenesis and Markers of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors | GIST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.
CD117 is also the sensitive marker for [[Pathogenesis and Markers of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors | GIST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>. DOG1 is another specific marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>. CD34 can also be positive in [[Pathogenesis and Markers of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors | GIST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>. CD34 is a marker for endothelial cells (lining blood vessels), hematopoietic stem cells, and solid fibrocystic tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>.

### Bezoars
Bezoars are masses found in the GI tract. A "trichobezoar" is formed from ingested hair, often seen in girls with long hair (Rapunzel syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>. A "phytobezoar" is formed from ingested plant products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>.

## Intestinal Disorders

### Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome
This syndrome is characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation (dark spots on lips, buccal mucosa, fingers) and intestinal polyps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:37:00">[26:37:00]</a>. Small bowel radiography shows medium-sized polyps, which are pathologically diagnosed as hamartomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>. The polyps are most commonly seen in the jejunum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:33:00">[27:33:00]</a>. Hamartomas are defined as an overgrowth of normal tissue components of the organ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>. In Peutz-Jeghers polyps, this involves an increase in smooth muscle bands forming a "Christmas tree" or "arborizing" pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>. To confirm if a tissue is muscle or collagen, a Masson's trichrome stain can be used: muscle stains red, while collagen stains blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>.

### Colonic Polyps

#### Hyperplastic Polyp
Hyperplastic polyps are tiny mucosal nodules, typically found in the rectum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[32:25:00]</a>. Microscopic examination reveals goblet cells and distorted crypt architecture without nuclear atypia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a>. They are characterized by an increase in cell number (hyperplasia) and serrations (zigzag folding) primarily in the upper part of the crypts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:27:00]</a>. Hyperplastic polyps are considered non-malignant and not pre-malignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:22:00">[34:22:00]</a>.

#### Sessile Serrated Adenoma
Unlike hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated adenomas show serrations throughout the full thickness of the crypts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. This distinction is crucial because sessile serrated adenomas are considered pre-malignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>.

### [[Parasitic infections and their clinical presentations | Whipple's Disease]]
[[Parasitic infections and their clinical presentations | Whipple's Disease]] is a disorder of the intestines that is PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>.

## Associated Conditions and Diagnostic Markers

### [[Genital and Reproductive System Disorders | Pernicious Anemia]]
Pernicious anemia is a cause of megaloblastic anemia with a normal reticulocyte count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>, distinguished from other megaloblastic anemias that typically have a low reticulocyte count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. It is caused by antibodies against intrinsic factor, which is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Intrinsic factor is produced by parietal cells in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Pernicious anemia can co-occur with other autoimmune disorders like Hashimoto's thyroiditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
Parietal cells are pink-staining cells in the stomach lining, distinct from blue-staining chief cells and empty-looking foveolar cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. Paneth cells, found primarily in the small intestine, have a special stain called Phloxine-tartrazine stain, which is also used for molluscum bodies in virology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

### [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)]] and [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)]]
[[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)]] presents with yellow eyes, dark urine, recurrent fever, and chronic diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. Laboratory studies show increased bilirubin (jaundice) with normal AST/ALT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>. ERCP shows a "beaded appearance" of the extrahepatic biliary tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:07:00">[36:07:00]</a>. Pathologically, it exhibits onion-skin fibrosis around the bile ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>. [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | PSC]] is associated with p-ANCA antibody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50:00">[37:50:00]</a> and is commonly seen in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:00">[39:20:00]</a>. It is also associated with [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | ulcerative colitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:00]</a>.

[[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)]] is compared with [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | PSC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>. [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | PBC]] typically affects older individuals (50s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>. It is associated with AMA (anti-mitochondrial antibody), which is against the E2 subunit of the PDH enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>. AMA is found in females, reflecting the higher incidence of [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | PBC]] in women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:00">[39:05:00]</a>.

### [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Dubin-Johnson Syndrome]]
[[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Dubin-Johnson Syndrome]] presents with yellow skin and sclera, dark urine, and increased conjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:54:00">[42:54:00]</a>. The history may include intermittent, asymptomatic jaundice triggered by stress, which can initially be mistaken for [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Gilbert's Syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:46:00">[43:46:00]</a>. However, [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Gilbert's Syndrome]] involves unconjugated bilirubin, whereas [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Dubin-Johnson Syndrome]] involves conjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:00">[44:12:00]</a>. Liver biopsy in [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Dubin-Johnson Syndrome]] shows dark brown pigment, characteristic of a "dark liver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09:00">[45:09:00]</a>. The condition is due to an MRP2 defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:52:00">[45:52:00]</a>. [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Rotor Syndrome]] also presents with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia but without liver pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:52:00">[44:52:00]</a>.

### [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia]]
This condition presents with jaundice, fatigue, and severe anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:06:00">[46:06:00]</a>. The jaundice is typically unconjugated, resulting from RBC breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:44:00">[46:44:00]</a>. Improvement of jaundice with corticosteroids indicates an autoimmune cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:28:00">[47:28:00]</a>.

### [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Viral Hepatitis]] (B, C)
Serological markers are crucial for diagnosing [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Hepatitis B]]. There are three antigens (surface, core, pre-core/e) and three antibodies (anti-surface, anti-core, anti-e) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>. Core antigen does not circulate in the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:27:00">[49:27:00]</a>.
The first marker to rise is HBsAg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:22:00">[50:22:00]</a>. HBeAg indicates infectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:00">[50:47:00]</a>. IgM anti-HBc is the marker for acute [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Hepatitis B]], and it is also the marker for the window period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:04:00">[51:04:00]</a>. IgG anti-HBc along with HBsAg indicates chronic [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Hepatitis B]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:06:00">[52:06:00]</a>. Liver biopsy is typically not performed for acute viral hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:03:00">[54:03:00]</a>.

Histological features in viral hepatitis:
*   Ground-glass hepatocytes are seen in [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Hepatitis B]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:38:00">[54:38:00]</a>.
*   Most lymphocytes are seen in [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Hepatitis C]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:52:00">[54:52:00]</a>.
*   Councilman bodies are often seen in [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Hepatitis C]], though they can be seen in most viral hepatitis cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>.

[[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Hepatitis B]] is associated with [[Pathology and cardiovascular disorders | polyarteritis nodosa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Autoimmune Hepatitis]]
[[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Autoimmune hepatitis]] often presents with jaundice in young women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:41:00">[56:41:00]</a>. Serology for viral hepatitis and anti-mitochondrial antibodies (ruling out [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | PBC]]) are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:51:00">[56:51:00]</a>. Liver biopsy shows lymphocytes and plasma cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:11:00">[57:11:00]</a>. Symptoms abate with corticosteroid treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:21:00">[57:21:00]</a>.

Key histological features of [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | autoimmune hepatitis]]:
*   **Interface Hepatitis:** Inflammation (lymphocytes and plasma cells) at the junction of the liver parenchyma and portal triad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:51:00">[58:51:00]</a>.
*   **Emperipolesis:** Larger cells engulfing smaller cells, often observed in the biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:32:00">[59:32:00]</a>. This is a common image-based question in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>.
*   **Hepatocyte Rosettes:** Liver cells forming a round, rose-like structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

[[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Autoimmune hepatitis]] is classified into types based on antibody profiles:
*   **Type 1:** Associated with ANA (antinuclear antibodies), ASMA (anti-smooth muscle antibodies), and SLA (soluble liver antigen) antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   **Type 2:** Associated with anti-LKM (liver-kidney microsome) antibodies, specifically anti-LKM2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>. This type is frequently associated with drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.
*   **Type 3:** Also associated with soluble liver antigen antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
Anti-LKM1 and anti-LKM3 are associated with [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Hepatitis C]] and [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Hepatitis D]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

### PAS Positive Stains and Associated Disorders
Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain is used to identify carbohydrates and glycoproteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. PAS gives a pink color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. Diastase enzyme breaks down glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.

*   **PAS positive, diastase sensitive:** If the pink color vanishes after adding diastase, the material is diastase sensitive. This indicates the presence of glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>. Conditions include:
    *   Glycogen storage disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.
    *   Ewing sarcoma (bone tumor containing glycogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
    *   Dysgerminoma and Seminoma (germ cell tumors containing glycogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

*   **PAS positive, diastase resistant:** If the pink color remains after adding diastase, the material is diastase resistant. Conditions include:
    *   [[Hepatitis and liver disorders | Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency]] (due to accumulated protein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.
    *   Amyloidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.
    *   Basement membrane (e.g., in kidney in diabetic nephropathy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.
    *   Thyroid colloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.
    *   [[Pathological features of various diseases | Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesion]] (in diabetic nephropathy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.
    *   Fungus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
    *   Leukemias (ALL, AML M3, M6, M7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.
    *   [[Parasitic infections and their clinical presentations | Whipple's Disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (iron overload) and Wilson's disease (copper overload) are not diagnosed using PAS stain; Pearl's stain is used for iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. Mikulicz's Gutmann bodies, primarily composed of calcium, can be PAS positive but are better marked by calcium markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>.

Multinucleated giant cells are highly characteristic findings in certain pathological conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Identification
These cells are notable for their size and internal structure:
*   They are described as "huge cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   They contain multiple nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Clinical Specimen Presentation
Multinucleated giant cells can be observed in various diagnostic samples:
*   **Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)**: They are a striking point in FNAC images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Biopsy**: They are also visible on biopsy, consistent with FNAC findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Association with Granulomas
Multinucleated giant cells are a key component of a [[role_of_biopsy_in_detecting_granulomas | granuloma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. In this context, they are typically found alongside:
*   **Epithelioid cells**: These cells have elongated or "slipper-shaped" nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Lymphocytic collar**: This is a surrounding ring of lymphocytes, appearing as tiny blue dots at the periphery of the granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

While giant cells are a common feature, a [[role_of_biopsy_in_detecting_granulomas | granuloma]] can sometimes be identified even without their presence, primarily through the observation of epithelioid cells surrounded by a lymphocytic collar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. An example of a condition where granulomas are seen is tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

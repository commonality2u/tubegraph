The last 10 days leading up to the FMG exam are crucial, representing a "make or break" period for students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This guide focuses on essential strategies and pitfalls to avoid for FMG students preparing for the January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Subject Management and Study Strategy

### Prioritizing Subjects
*   **Assess Your Progress** Make a list of subjects you have completed and those that are still pending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Don't Introduce New Material** Avoid starting new topics or rare subjects within areas you've already studied (e.g., pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Cover All Subjects Minimally** It's essential to know a little about all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Aim to answer at least 50% of questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Leverage Rapid Revision Resources** For unstudied subjects (e.g., orthopedics, anesthesia, forensics, dermatology), utilize 3-hour LRR (Last Minute Revision) sessions or crash courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. There isn't time for main videos or even standard rapid revision videos at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Allocate Time for Short Subjects** Dedicate approximately 2.5 days to short subjects like psychiatry, radiology, orthopedics, anesthesia, forensic medicine, dermatology, ENT, and ophthalmology, focusing on LRR content and previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Address Volatile Subjects** For "giant" or volatile subjects such as anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, and PSM, concentrate on LRR and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. It's common to feel like you're forgetting these subjects; everyone faces this challenge, and no one fully memorizes all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Don't Skip Subjects** You cannot afford to leave any subject completely untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. Even for challenging subjects like pharmacology, aim to score at least 50% by focusing on LRR and PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. This phase is about "survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>, not enjoyment of the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

### Daily Schedule and Focus
*   **Become a "Scanning Machine"** Your goal is to quickly scan all previously read material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Divide Your Day into Slots**
    *   **Study (Theory & MCQs):** Dedicate the majority of your day.
    *   **Images:** Allocate one hour daily to review images, quickly scanning them before sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
    *   **Sanity Break:** Take a 30-minute break for outdoor activity or a non-study distraction to avoid mental exhaustion and maintain normalcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Ensure this doesn't extend to 3-4 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   **Study Hours** Aim for a minimum of 12-14 productive hours of study daily, ensuring 6-8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Do not compromise sleep or use medications for wakefulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **Balance Theory and MCQs** Divide your study time with 60% on MCQs and 40% on theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. When solving MCQs, focus on explanations to cover theory simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Daily MCQ Practice** Aim to solve at least 150-200 MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. Gradually increase your daily count if you're starting lower (e.g., 10-15 questions per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs) and Mock Exams

*   **Approach to Grand Tests** It is a personal choice whether to take a GT in the last 9 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Time Management** If you take a GT, prioritize time management to ensure you can complete 300 questions within the allotted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
    *   **Identify Silly Mistakes** Use GTs to catch and understand why you make silly mistakes, indicating a need for more MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.
    *   **Don't Obsess Over Scores** Do not focus on achieving a specific score (e.g., 150+) in the GTs, as a low score can lead to panic and hinder further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The target score of 150+ is for the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Analyzing GT Performance** If you are stuck between 130-150, quickly analyze your GT for:
    *   Silly mistakes (practice more MCQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
    *   Knowledge gaps (revisit LRR notes and relevant topics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.
*   **New Questions in MCQs** Don't be discouraged by 20-30 "new" or "bouncer" questions in GTs; these are designed to prevent overconfidence and don't determine pass/fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>.
*   **Custom Modules** Using custom modules from platforms like PrepLadder is beneficial as it acts like a mini-GT for specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.

## Previous Year Questions (PYQs) and Topics

*   **FMG PYQs** Complete 5 years of FMG PYQs as a mandatory step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
*   **NEET PG PYQs** If time permits, review 3 years of NEET PG questions (2020, 2021, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. Recall sessions on YouTube can be useful if you can't solve them yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **INI CET Exam** If you have extra time, review the INI CET exam paper from November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
*   **Focus on Topics, Not Just Memorized Answers** Do not rely on memorizing answers to PYQs, as direct copy-pasting is rare now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Instead, focus on understanding the previous year topics and solving related MCQs from Q-banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

## [[Addressing exam anxiety and motivation challenges|Addressing Exam Anxiety and Motivation Challenges]]

*   **Prioritize Positivity** Surround yourself with positive influences like family, good friends, and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Avoid Negative Influences** Stay away from people who boast about high scores or spread rumors about exam difficulty or patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Block Negative Thoughts** Do not allow negative thoughts about the exam day (e.g., alarm failure, computer issues) to consume your mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.
*   **Combat Mental Exhaustion** If you feel sleepy or depressed, it's often due to mental exhaustion. The 30-minute sanity break helps here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Mindset is Key** Success in competitive exams like FMG is more about mindset and approach than just knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Stay mentally stable and avoid negativity, as every negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
*   **Handle Tough Exam Papers** Remember that one paper might be tough and the other easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. If Paper 1 is difficult, disconnect during the break and focus solely on Paper 2, without carrying the "hangover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Present** Work in small, three-hour "boxes," focusing on what to study in the immediate future, rather than worrying about your condition days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

## [[Lastminute exam checklist|Last-Minute Checklist]]

*   **Normalize Sleep Cycle** Adjust your sleep schedule to be alert during morning exam hours (9 AM - 11 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **No Experimentation** Stick to your established routine; do not try new medications or routines the day before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Increase Study Duration** The Pomodoro technique (20 min study, 10 min break) is no longer suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hour stretches without distractions to build stamina for the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.
*   **Last Day Revision** Focus primarily on PYQs and LRR content on the last day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. Prioritize volatile or weak subjects that you tend to forget, such as biochemistry cycles, microbiology catalysts, nerve supplies, pharmacology drugs, and biostatistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

The goal for the FMG exam is to cross 150+ marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. If you achieve this, you are guaranteed an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. Keep studying consistently without overthinking what you will remember or the future outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

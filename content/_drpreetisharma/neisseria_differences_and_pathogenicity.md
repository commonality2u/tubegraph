Neisseria are a genus of bacteria that are notable exceptions to the general rule that all cocci are Gram-positive [01:46:00]. Instead, Neisseria, along with *Moraxella* and *Veillonella*, are Gram-negative cocci [01:48:00].

## General Characteristics
Neisseria are Gram-negative cocci that appear as "dot dot cocci" under the microscope [01:45:00].

### Natural Habitat
*   **Neisseria meningitidis**: Commonly and normally present in the nasopharynx [01:17:00, 01:02:19].
*   **Neisseria gonorrhoeae**: Present in the genital region [01:02:21].

### Culture and Transport Media
*   **Growth Media**: Both *Neisseria meningitidis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* can be grown in a charcoal-based medium known as the Thea Martin medium [01:06:25, 01:06:31]. *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* can also be grown in the modified New York agar [01:06:36].
*   **Transport Media**: The transport media for Neisseria are Stuart's or Amy's media [01:06:45, 01:06:47].

## Differentiation of Neisseria Species

### Neisseria meningitidis
*   **Fermentation**: Ferments both maltose and glucose [01:02:49]. The "M" and "G" in "meningitidis" can serve as a mnemonic for maltose and glucose fermentation [01:02:51].
*   **Shape**: Appears lanceolate or lens-shaped, resembling an "M" turned sideways, and possesses a capsule [01:03:44, 01:03:47].
*   **Pathogenicity and Clinical Features**:
    *   Causes [[systemic_pathology_and_bacteriology | meningitis]] [01:01:56, 01:04:22].
    *   Can cause bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, also known as Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome [01:04:39, 01:04:52].
*   **Vaccine**: The meningococcal vaccine targets *Neisseria meningitidis* and includes serotypes A, C, Y, and W135 [01:07:31, 01:07:56]. However, serotype B is not used in the vaccine [01:08:07, 01:08:09].

### Neisseria gonorrhoeae
*   **Fermentation**: Only ferments glucose, not maltose [01:02:56, 01:03:13].
*   **Shape**: Described as bean-shaped or kidney-shaped, resembling two "G"s, and does not have a capsule [01:04:00, 01:04:13].
*   **Pathogenicity and Clinical Features**:
    *   Causes [[common_infectious_diseases_and_their_clinical_features | gonorrhea]] (genital infections/STDs) [01:01:59, 01:04:25, 01:05:05].
    *   Can cause ophthalmia neonatorum in neonates who acquire the infection while passing through the birth canal of an infected mother [01:05:07, 01:05:14].
    *   Can also cause Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, which is perihepatitis (inflammation and fibrosis around the liver) [01:05:32, 01:05:43, 01:05:51].

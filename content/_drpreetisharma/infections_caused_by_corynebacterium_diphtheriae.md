[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae characteristics and testing | Corynebacterium diphtheriae]] is a [[Gram positive bacilli | gram-positive bacillus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. It is part of the "McDonald's" mnemonic for identifying [[Gram positive bacilli | gram-positive bacilli]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, which also includes *Mycobacteria*, *Anthrax*, *Clostridium*, *Nocardia*, *Actinomyces*, and *Listeria* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>
*   **Gram Stain**: Gram-positive, appearing purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Motility**: Non-motile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Spore Formation**: Non-spore-forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Encapsulation**: Non-encapsulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Morphology**: Long bacilli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>, classically forming "Chinese letter" or "cuniform arrangement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. They have bulbous ends with large granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.
*   **Granules**: These are known as Volutin granules, Babes-Ernst granules, bipolar granules, or metachromatic granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. They contain polymetaphosphate energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
*   **Staining of Granules**: Albert stain uses Toluidine blue, Iodine, and Malachite green (TIM mnemonic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. With Albert stain, the bacteria appear green, and the granules appear purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. Toluidine blue is considered a metachromatic stain because it appears blue in the bottle but gives a different color (purple) under the microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **Toxin**: Produces a potent toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>
Diphtheria is a classic infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, typically presenting with:
*   Sore throat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   Low-grade fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   Thick throat membrane covering the tonsils and pharynx (pseudo membrane) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The sample for diagnosis should be taken from under the membrane, not the membrane itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   Enlarged lymph nodes leading to a "bull's neck" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   The infection spreads by droplet infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>.

### Complications
The most common complication of diphtheria is myocarditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. In myocarditis, the heart may show fat deposition, leading to a "tiger and tabby cat appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

## Diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>
### Culture Media
*   **Enriched Culture Media**: Loeffler serum slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Growth typically takes 6 to 8 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>, making it useful for early diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.
*   **Selective Culture Media**: Potassium tellurite agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a> and Tinsdale agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
    *   Tellurite is a metal that causes the colonies to appear black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
    *   Growth on selective media takes longer, around 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
    *   Potassium tellurite agar is considered the best culture media for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

### Toxin Detection Tests
*   **Elek Gel Precipitation Test**: Used to determine the toxigenicity of the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
    *   A strip containing antitoxin is placed on a culture media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
    *   If the bacteria produce toxin, they will react with the antitoxin, forming precipitant lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. The presence of lines indicates a toxigenic *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

### Susceptibility Test
*   **Schick Test**: An intradermal test (similar to Montoux test for TB) used to determine the patient's susceptibility to diphtheria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.
    *   It is a type III hypersensitivity reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
    *   **Positive Schick Test**: Redness appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, indicating the patient is susceptible to infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.
    *   **Negative Schick Test**: No redness appears, indicating the patient is immune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.

## Toxin Mechanism of Action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>
The diphtheria toxin decreases protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. It does this by ADP-ribosylation of EF2 (Elongation Factor 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Other toxins that decrease protein synthesis include Pseudomonas Exotoxin A, Shiga toxin, and Shiga-like toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## Treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>
*   **Diphtheria Antitoxin**: The dose ranges from 20,000 to 120,000 International Units, typically given intramuscularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
    *   For pharyngeal disease: 20,000-40,000 IU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
    *   For nasopharyngeal disease: 40,000-60,000 IU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.
    *   For extensive disease: 80,000-120,000 IU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.
    *   If there is neck disease (bull's neck) or if the disease has been present for more than three days, half the dose is given intramuscularly and half intravenously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.
*   **Antibiotics**: Penicillin and Erythromycin are relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.
*   **Precautions**: Droplet precautions are essential due to the mode of transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

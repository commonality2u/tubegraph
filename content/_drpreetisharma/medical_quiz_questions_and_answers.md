## Gastrointestinal System & Liver

### Achalasia Cardia
A 35-year-old man presents with difficulty in swallowing and a tendency to regurgitate food. Endoscopy reveals no gastric or esophageal abnormalities. Manometric studies show complete absent peristalsis, failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax upon swallowing, and increased pressure in the LES <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

*   **Diagnosis:** Achalasia Cardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Classical Appearance (Barium Study):** Bird's Beak Appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Etiology:**
    *   Most cases are idiopathic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   Infection-related: *Trypanosoma cruzi* (causing Chagas Disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Herpes can also cause it but *Trypanosoma cruzi* is the single best answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Pathology (Chagas Disease):** Leads to megaesophagus and megacolon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, characterized by a very dilated esophagus due to obstruction at the lower end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Plummer-Vinson Syndrome (PVS)
A 20-year-old woman presents with a two-year history of difficulty in swallowing and increasing fatigue. CBC shows iron deficiency anemia. Upper endoscopy shows an enlarged narrowing in the upper third of the esophagus. Mucosal biopsy shows no evidence of inflammation or neoplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

*   **Diagnosis:** Plummer-Vinson Syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> (also known as Paterson-Brown-Kelly Syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> or Sideropenic Dysphagia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>).
*   **Triad of PVS:**
    *   Iron deficiency anemia (Sideropenic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   Dysphagia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   Esophageal webs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> (constriction, no inflammation or cancer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Associated Risk:** Patients with PVS are at increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Chronic Hepatitis and Autoimmune Disorders
A 45-year-old woman presents with a six-month history of fatigue and swelling in the neck (goiter). CBC shows megaloblastic anemia and normal reticulocyte count. Elevated levels of TSH and anti-thyroid antibodies are noted. FNAC shows benign cells with numerous lymphocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The anemia is most likely caused by antibodies against which target?

*   **Clinical Presentation:** Fatigue and goiter suggest hypothyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Megaloblastic anemia with normal reticulocyte count (usually low in megaloblastic anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>). Elevated TSH and anti-thyroid antibodies, with lymphocytes on FNAC, point to Hashimoto's thyroiditis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Anemia Cause:** Megaloblastic anemia is often due to Vitamin B12 deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Vitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, which is produced by parietal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> in the stomach. Autoimmune thyroiditis can be associated with Pernicious Anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, where antibodies target parietal cells, preventing intrinsic factor release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Parietal Cells vs. Paneth Cells:**
    *   **Parietal cells:** Located in the stomach, they are pink-stained, produce intrinsic factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, and are targeted in pernicious anemia.
    *   **Paneth cells:** Found more in the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. They can be stained with Phloxine Tartrazine Stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, which also stains viral inclusion bodies like Patterson bodies in molluscum contagiosum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Linitis Plastica / Diffuse Gastric Cancer
A 58-year-old woman with a two-month history of abdominal distension and dark stools. Physical examination shows pallor. Microcytic hypochromic anemia with hemoglobin of 6 g/dL. Barium swallow shows a "leather bottle" appearance of the stomach. Endoscopic biopsy reveals signet ring cells in the infiltrative stomach wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

*   **Diagnosis:** Linitis Plastica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a> (clinician/radiologist term) or Diffuse Gastric Cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a> (pathologist term).
*   **Pathology:** Cancer infiltrates the stomach wall, making it hard and rigid like a "leather bottle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Key Cell Type:** Signet ring cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, characterized by a nucleus pushed to the side by abundant mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Genetic Alteration:** CDH1 gene mutation (E-cadherin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. E-cadherin acts as a "glue" holding cells together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **"Golu Tumor" Mnemonic:** When the E-cadherin "glue" is gone, tumors become invasive and diffuse:
    *   **G:** Diffuse Gastric Cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
    *   **L:** Invasive Lobular Carcinoma of the Breast (shows "Indian file" pattern) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **Other Signet Ring Cell Tumors:** Krukenberg Tumor (ovarian metastasis from gastric cancer, also contains mucin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
A 45-year-old woman presents with a six-month history of fatigue and swelling in the neck (goiter). CBC shows megaloblastic anemia and normal reticulocyte count.

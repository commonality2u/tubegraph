[[Diabetic nephropathy pathology and special stains | Diabetic nephropathy]] is a significant condition to understand in [[Renal and Genital Pathology | renal pathology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A 55-year-old female presenting for a health checkup with massively elevated HbA1c (uncontrolled diabetes) and urine showing protein 2+ and glucose 3+ indicates kidney failure due to diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

## Histological Features of Diabetic Nephropathy
Key findings in [[Diabetic nephropathy pathology and special stains | diabetic nephropathy]] include:

*   **Thickening of the capillaries** One of the earliest changes, as diabetes affects blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   **Hyaline Arteriosclerosis** An important disease for blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
*   **Armani-Ebstein Lesion**
    *   Characterized by glycogen deposits in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.
    *   Considered a "branded name" finding in diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.
*   **Nodular Glomerular Sclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson Lesion)**
    *   Also known as "NGSS" (Nodular Glomerular Sclerosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
    *   Appears as pink, nodular formations in the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
    *   The sclerosis is due to glycosylation of proteins, not glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
    *   Can be highlighted well with a PAS stain, showing "pink nodules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Diffuse Glomerular Sclerosis** A more widespread form following nodular sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.
*   **Capsular Drop** Pinkish material seen "dropping" from Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   **Fiebig** Described as a ring of "fibs" or small pinkish dots on the capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Renal Papillary Necrosis** The renal papilla undergoes necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

## Special Stains
*   **PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) Stain**: Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions are PAS positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. PAS makes the nodules appear distinctly pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Papillary Necrosis Causes
[[Diabetic nephropathy pathology and special stains | Diabetic nephropathy]] is the most common cause of papillary necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. Other main causes include:
*   Obstruction in the kidney (Obstructive Disorders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>
*   Sickle Cell Anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>
*   Analgesic abuse (e.g., phenacetin abuse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>

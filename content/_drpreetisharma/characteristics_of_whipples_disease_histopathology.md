[[Histopathological Examination | Whipple's disease]] is a condition caused by the gram-positive bacterium *Tropheryma whipplei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. It primarily leads to malabsorption in the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, and its characteristic histopathology is crucial for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Key Histopathological Findings
The classical [[Histopathological Examination | histopathology]] of Whipple's disease is the presence of PAS-positive macrophages within the lamina propria of the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

These macrophages appear as "foam cells" under the microscope, characterized by their whitish appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. These "foam cells" are essentially macrophages that have engulfed *Tropheryma whipplei* bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

To confirm the presence of *Tropheryma whipplei* within these foam cells, a Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The PAS stain causes the whitish foam cells to turn pinkish in color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, making the PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria a definitive diagnostic feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis
When "foam cells" are observed on [[Histopathological Examination | histopathology]], [[Histopathological Examination | Whipple's disease]] is a primary differential diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. However, tuberculosis (TB) also presents with macrophages that can appear similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

To differentiate between the two, an acid-fast stain can be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. TB lesions would test positive for acid-fast bacilli, distinguishing them from Whipple's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

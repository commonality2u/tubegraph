[[Microbiological and histological examination techniques | Staining techniques]] are fundamental tools in [[microbiological_techniques_and_tests | microbiology]] labs for identifying and differentiating microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. They allow visualization of bacteria, fungi, and parasites, aiding in diagnosis and study.

## Gram Staining

Gram staining is a [[types_of_staining_techniques_for_diagnosing_infections | differential staining technique]] that differentiates bacteria into two large groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:12">[02:51:12]</a>.

### Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>
The mnemonic for the protocol is "Come in and stain" (C-I-A-S) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:27">[02:57:27]</a>:
1.  **Crystal Violet (C):** Applied first, staining both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms purple/violet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:48">[02:58:48]</a>.
2.  **Iodine (I):** Acts as a mordant, forming a complex with crystal violet to "hammer" the stain into the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:13">[03:10:13]</a>.
3.  **Alcohol or Acetone (A):** Functions as a decolorizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:41">[03:40:41]</a>. Gram-positive bacteria retain the purple color, while Gram-negative bacteria become colorless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.
4.  **Safranin (S):** A red counterstain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:27">[03:46:27]</a>. Gram-negative bacteria, having lost their initial stain, will pick up the red color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:48">[03:46:48]</a>.

### Results
*   **Gram-positive organisms:** Appear purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:05">[03:10:05]</a>.
*   **Gram-negative organisms:** Appear reddish-pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:15">[03:22:15]</a>.

### Cellular Basis for Differentiation
The differentiation in Gram staining is due to differences in the bacterial cell wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.
*   **Gram-positive bacteria:** Possess a very thick peptidoglycan layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:31">[03:53:31]</a>. They also have a pentapeptide bridge connecting N-acetyl muramic acid (NAM) molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:41">[03:52:41]</a>. The crystal violet-iodine complex is retained within this thick layer.
*   **Gram-negative bacteria:** Have a very thin peptidoglycan layer and no pentapeptide bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:59">[03:53:59]</a>. Their cell wall contains more lipopolysaccharides (LPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:06">[03:54:06]</a>. The decolorizer washes out the crystal violet-iodine complex, allowing the safranin to stain them red.

## Zeil-Nelson (ZN) Stain / Acid-Fast Stain

The [[types_of_staining_techniques_for_diagnosing_infections | acid-fast stain]], originally given by [[paul_ehrlich | Paul Ehrlich]], was later modified by Zeil and Nelson, leading to its common name, the ZN stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. It is used to identify acid-fast organisms, notably mycobacteria.

### Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:13">[03:13:13]</a>
The mnemonic for the protocol is "CHAM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:07">[03:13:07]</a>:
1.  **Carbol Fuchsin (C):** Primary stain, gives a red color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:19">[03:16:19]</a>.
2.  **Heating (H):** Applied to facilitate stain penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:28">[03:26:28]</a>.
3.  **Acid (A):** Decolorizer, typically sulfuric acid (H2SO4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:35">[03:32:35]</a>. Acid-fast organisms retain the red stain even after acid decolorization.
4.  **Methylene Blue (M):** Counterstain, gives a blue color to the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:54">[03:33:54]</a>.

### Results
*   **Acid-fast organisms:** Appear red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:41">[03:39:41]</a>.
*   **Background:** Appears blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:50">[03:48:50]</a>.

### Variations and Applications
*   **Cold ZN Stain (Kinion or Gabard Stain):** This variation omits the heating step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:57">[03:55:57]</a>. It is used for coccidian parasites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:01">[03:57:01]</a>.
*   **Acid Concentrations:** Different concentrations of sulfuric acid are used for various organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:16">[03:59:16]</a>:
    *   **20% H2SO4:** For [[diagnostic_methods_for_bacterial_infections | tuberculosis]] (TB) and atypical mycobacteria (T20 mnemonic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:22">[03:59:22]</a>.
    *   **5% H2SO4:** For leprosy (Lepra has 5 letters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:46">[04:02:46]</a>. This specific application is known as the **Fite-Faraco stain** ("fight" sounds like "five") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:42">[04:05:42]</a>.
    *   **1% H2SO4:** For Nocardia and Legionella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:55">[04:06:55]</a>.
    *   **0.25-0.5% H2SO4:** For bacterial spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:16">[04:08:16]</a>.

### Acid-Fast Positive Organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:03">[04:10:03]</a>
The mnemonic "My nose is cold and hot" helps remember organisms that are acid-fast positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>:
*   **My:** Mycobacteria (TB, leprosy, atypical mycobacteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:37">[04:13:37]</a>.
*   **No:** Nocardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:57">[04:14:57]</a>.
*   **Is:** Isospora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:03">[04:16:03]</a>.
*   **Cold:** Cyclospora, Cryptosporidium (coccidian parasites, use cold ZN stain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:11">[04:17:11]</a>.
*   **Ho:** Hooklets of hydatid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:15">[04:19:15]</a>.
*   **T:** Taenia saginata eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:07">[04:20:07]</a>.

## Negative Staining

Negative staining is a technique where the background is stained, leaving the organism unstained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:55">[04:29:55]</a>. This creates a clear halo around the microorganism, highlighting its capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:38">[04:36:38]</a>.

### Stains Used
Common negative stains include India Ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:17">[04:41:17]</a> and Nigrosin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:22">[04:42:22]</a>.

### Application
It is particularly useful for visualizing organisms with capsules, such as [[staining_techniques_for_studying_fungi | Cryptococcus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:59">[04:39:59]</a>.

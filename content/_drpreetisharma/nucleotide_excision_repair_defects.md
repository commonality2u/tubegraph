Defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER) are a type of DNA repair disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. When there is a problem with the excision in nucleotide excision repair, it leads to conditions like [[xeroderma_pigmentosum | Xeroderma Pigmentosum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

## Xeroderma Pigmentosum

[[xeroderma_pigmentosum | Xeroderma Pigmentosum]] is characterized by a defect in nucleotide excision repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Patients with this condition are highly susceptible to skin cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.

Clinical presentation may include:
*   Hypopigmented, ulcerated patches on the face and forearms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.
*   Indurated, crater-like skin nodules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
*   Biopsies revealing skin carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.
*   Molecular studies showing germline mutations in genes coding for nucleotide excision repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

## Other DNA Repair Defects

Beyond nucleotide excision repair, other DNA repair mechanisms can be affected, leading to different syndromes:

*   **Mismatch Repair (MMR) Gene Defects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>:
    *   Associated with [[hereditary_nonpolyposis_colorectal_cancer | Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer]] (HNPCC), also known as [[Lynch syndrome | Lynch Syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
    *   [[Lynch syndrome | Lynch Syndrome]] is the only autosomal dominant condition among the commonly discussed DNA repair defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

*   **Homologous Recombination Defects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>:
    *   According to Robbins, this defect can result in three conditions:
        *   [[fanconi_anemia | Fanconi Anemia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>
        *   [[bloom_syndrome | Bloom Syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>
        *   [[ataxia_telangiectasia | Ataxia-telangiectasia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>

## Inheritance Patterns

Most DNA repair defects, including [[xeroderma_pigmentosum | Xeroderma Pigmentosum]], [[bloom_syndrome | Bloom Syndrome]], [[fanconi_anemia | Fanconi Anemia]], and [[ataxia_telangiectasia | Ataxia-telangiectasia]], are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

A mnemonic for autosomal recessive conditions is **BIG FACTS** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>:
*   **B** - [[bloom_syndrome | Bloom Syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>
*   **F** - [[fanconi_anemia | Fanconi Anemia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>
*   **A** - [[ataxia_telangiectasia | Ataxia-telangiectasia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>
*   **X** - [[xeroderma_pigmentosum | Xeroderma Pigmentosum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a> (X is used in the mnemonic to represent Z for Xeroderma Pigmentosum).

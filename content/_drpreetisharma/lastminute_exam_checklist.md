As the final exam approaches, it's normal to experience heightened heart rates and palpitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This period is less about new academic learning and more about strategic preparation and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Evening Before the Exam

It is crucial to wrap up your studies maximum by 7-7:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The focus should then shift to settling down, easing yourself, and ensuring a good night's sleep, as this is of utmost importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Documents and Logistics
Before the exam day, review your checklist for essential items:
*   **Admit Card and ID Proof** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>: Ensure your admit card is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Confirm that the name on your valid ID proof matches the name on the admit card exactly, with no spelling mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. You do not need to paste a photograph on the admit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Keep your ID in an easily accessible place to avoid misplacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Exam Center Location** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>: Confirm the exact location of your exam center to avoid last-minute rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Arrival Time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>: Entry for Paper One starts at 7:00 AM and closes at 8:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It's crucial to arrive well in advance to allow time for your heart rate to normalize before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Last-Minute Study (Optional)
If you have your own volatile list of topics, stick to that for final review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. If not, consider scanning through images from subjects like Pathology, Microbiology, Orthopedics, and Radiology, as they often feature classical spotter images that are helpful in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Avoid studying after 8 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

## During the Exam Day

### Inter-Paper Strategy
Between Paper One and Paper Two:
*   **Avoid Discussion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>: Do not engage in discussions about Paper One with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Discussing answers, especially if you find out you made a mistake, can negatively impact your mindset and performance for the second paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Stay away and close your ears to any such conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Light Refreshments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>: Eat or drink something light that provides energy for Paper Two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Managing Expectations and [[managing_exam_anxiety_and_stress | Anxiety]]
*   **Paper Difficulty** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>: Historically, one paper tends to be easier, and the other more difficult, creating a balanced average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. If Paper One feels challenging, do not lose hope; Paper Two might be easier, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Handling "Bouncer" Questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>: Expect 10-20 "bouncer" questions in each paper that are exceptionally difficult and not meant for anyone to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Do not dwell on these questions, as they can demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Mark an answer (A, B, C, or D) and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Your focus should be on avoiding silly mistakes in the easier, solvable questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Mindset and Approach
*   **Positive Affirmation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>: Consistently affirm that the paper will be easy and that you will avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Present Moment Focus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>: When answering a question, focus solely on that question. Do not think about past mistakes or future questions. Employ a "switch on, attempt, switch off, next question" mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Believe in Yourself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>: Your first gut feeling is often correct, especially when you are not under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Maintain a positive outlook, as negativity can lead to more silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Aim to cross the bare minimum of 150 marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overthinking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>: Overthinking creates problems in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Spend about 45 seconds per question, mark your answer, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Do not change many answers in the last few minutes due to panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Confidence vs. Overconfidence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>: Be super confident until 8:30 AM on exam day, believing your preparation, strategy, and sources are the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Once you sit at the computer screen, shift to a sane, practical mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Thorough Reading** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>: Read every question and all options thoroughly, even if you feel you know the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This prevents regrets from missing twists or details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **[[Time management and exam anxiety | Pacing]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>: Some questions will be quick one-liners, others lengthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Don't worry if a lengthy question takes more than 50 seconds; the paper is balanced, and quicker questions will make up for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. A slight lag in the first 15 minutes is normal as you settle in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Post-Exam Mindset

Until 4:30-5:00 PM on exam day, commit to thinking only positive thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Your journey to becoming a doctor is a testament to your hard work, and this exam is just a formality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Don't let external judgment or the outcome of one exam define your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

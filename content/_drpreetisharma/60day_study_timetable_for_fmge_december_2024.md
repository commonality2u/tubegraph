Dr. Preeti Sharma presents a concise 60-day study plan and strategy for the upcoming [[fmge_december_2023_preparation_strategy | FMGE December 2024 exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This plan is designed for all students, whether they are appearing for the first time or retaking the exam after not achieving a score of 150 in the June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This initial 60-day timetable runs from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, after which a separate [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | revision plan]] will be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Core Principles of the 60-Day Plan

This plan emphasizes balancing theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

*   **Daily MCQs:** Students should aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If not already practicing this many, gradually increase the number by 15-20 per day until reaching the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Study Hours:** A consistent average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This duration is necessary to complete the syllabus within 60 days to allow for subsequent revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The key to cracking the exam lies in multiple revisions and daily MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Single Source Per Subject:** It is essential to choose a single source for each subject. This might involve mixing and matching faculty or notes from different platforms, but stick to one chosen source per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Video Selection:**
    *   For stronger subjects (where you score above 80% in Q-bank), refer to [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | rapid revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   For weaker subjects or topics (scoring less than 80% in Q-bank), utilize main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   Specifically, for Pathology and Microbiology, it is recommended to use only rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For example, PrepLadder's rapid revision for Pathology is 19 hours and Microbiology is 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, suggesting approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day, watched at 1.5x to 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Subject Blocks and Days Allocated

The syllabus is divided into four integrated blocks to facilitate understanding and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This is a 58-day study plan, with an additional 2 days reserved for Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

Two dedicated days are for Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. A GT day involves taking the test and reviewing it on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

*   **GT 1:** September 8th (after finishing 15 subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
*   **GT 2:** September 21st (marks the end of the 60-day timetable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

## Daily Routine for Effective Preparation

This suggested [[daily_routine_for_effective_fmge_preparation | daily routine]] is designed to achieve 8-10 hours of study while incorporating adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

*   **Morning Routine (7:00 AM - 8:00 AM):** Dedicate one hour to a relaxed morning routine, possibly including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM):** First 3-hour study session to simulate exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Break 1 (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM):** Half-hour break for relaxation (no social media or screens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM):** Second study session of 2.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM):** 1.5-hour break for lunch and relaxation, including a power nap or optional social media/entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

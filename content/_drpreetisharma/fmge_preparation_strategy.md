This guide outlines an [[exam_preparation_strategy_for_fmge | exam preparation strategy for FMGE]] aspirants, focusing on a structured timetable, effective study methods, and maintaining a positive mindset for the [[FMGE December 2024 exam preparation strategy | FMGE December 2024 exam]]. The information is tailored specifically for FMG students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> and aims to help candidates prepare for the January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Immediate Action Required
The period until Diwali was a breathing space, which is now over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Students must begin their course immediately after this session, with no time wastage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Common Questions and Answers

### Should I practice MCQs alongside theory?
Yes, MCQs must be done side-by-side with theory every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. With approximately two months and an additional week until the exam, there isn't time to do theory first and then MCQs separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Should I go for main videos or Rapid Revision (RR)?
Focus on [[role_of_rapid_revision_in_fmge_success | Rapid Revision]] (RR) when you have two months in hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Main videos should only be used to clarify concepts that are not clear from RR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. For example, if a concept like "strein disinfection" is unclear in RR, open the main videos, play for 10 minutes to clear the doubt, and then return to RR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### What should be my source of questions?
Use a Q-bank from any platform you already have a subscription for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Additionally, solve previous year *topics*, not just rote questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This can be done via an app or FMG solutions textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Focus on topics that have frequently appeared, e.g., if "apoptosis" has appeared 10 times, study that topic from your pathology notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### How many hours of study per day?
Aim for at least 10 to 12 effective hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This accounts for time wastage due to anxiety, panic, social media, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. If you sit for 12 hours, your output will likely be 10 effective hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### How many MCQs should I do per day?
Aim for 100+ MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. These are integrated with your daily subject study; for example, if studying pathology, the MCQs from its chapters will likely cross 100 questions naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. If you can't start with 100, begin with 50 and gradually increase by 5-7 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. You will pick up speed within a week and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## The Study Timetable: Round One (First Revision)

This timetable has no breathing space and requires immediate implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. You can adjust the order of subjects, but stick to the allocated days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

-   **Anatomy:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
-   **Orthopedics:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
-   **Biochemistry:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>
-   **Pathology:** 3 days (November 20-22). This is strategically placed before Prep Ladder's LRR session for FMG students on November 23-24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. During these LRR sessions, you can use the rest of the day to study another short subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
-   **Psychiatry:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
-   **ENT:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
-   **Dermatology:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
-   **PSM:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. While PSM can have weird and numerous questions, focusing on main topics for four days should be sufficient; don't aim to master every obscure question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
-   **Anesthesia:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
-   **Microbiology:** 3 days (December 2-4), coinciding with Prep Ladder's LRR session on December 3-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
-   **Surgery:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>
-   **Radiology:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>
-   **OBG:** 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>
-   **Ophthalmology:** 2 days. This subject, especially neuro-ophthalmology and squint, can be tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
-   **Pharmacology:** 3 days. Placed towards the end because it's volatile, and reading it closer to the exam may help retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
-   **Pediatrics:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>
-   **Forensic Medicine:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>
-   **Physiology:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>

### Integrating Medicine into the Timetable
Medicine is not given dedicated days in this initial timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Instead, from November 23rd onwards (after pathology is finished), dedicate 1 to 1.5 hours to medicine daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This consistent daily study should continue until January 19th, the day before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. By finishing pathology, you will have covered 40-50% of medicine, making subsequent study easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

> [!TIP] Discipline is key: Fix a specific time for medicine every day (e.g., 10 AM to 11 AM) and stick to it, regardless of other circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Daily Targets for Pathology and Microbiology (Round Two)
In Round One, pathology and microbiology are to be done via [[role_of_rapid_revision_in_fmge_success | Rapid Revision]] from your chosen source (Prep Ladder or Unacademy crash course notes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Do not change your source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

After December 24th, daily targets will be provided for pathology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. These will be short targets (30-40 minutes) of high-yield topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. The goal is to finish these by January 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## The Study Timetable: Round Two (Second Revision)

After finishing Round One (by December 24th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, you'll start Round Two. This second round of revision aims to be completed by January 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

-   **Short Subjects (Psych, Radio, Ortho, Anesthesia, Forensic, Skin):** 3 days total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>
-   **ENT & Ophthalmology:** 2.5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>
-   **Grand Test:** 0.5 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>
-   **PSM:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>
-   **OBGY:** 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>
-   **Surgery:** 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>
-   **Physiology & Pediatrics:** 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a> (using quick notes, RR, and LRR for quick coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>)
-   **Volatile Subjects (Biochemistry, Anatomy, Pharmacology):** 2 days each, placed near the exam for better retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Round Three (Final Week)
The last 6-7 days (after January 13th) should be dedicated to:
-   **Previous year questions (PYQs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
-   **Volatile topics** that have been challenging during LRR sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Grand Test (GT) Strategy

Give a minimum of **five Grand Tests** before the January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

### Purpose of GTs:
1.  **[[time_management_techniques_for_fmge | Time Management]]:** Learn to manage time effectively, especially in the last hour of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. Maintain a pace of 45-50 seconds per question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
2.  **Analysis of Incorrect Questions:** Focus analysis on incorrect questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Read explanations from your chosen app/solution, not textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. For correct questions, simply re-read the relevant section in your notes if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

### GT Score Focus:
Do not focus on scoring above 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. GTs on platforms are often designed to be slightly tougher (e.g., 150+ in GT might equate to 170-180 in the actual exam) to encourage continued study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. The primary goal is to practice sitting for long stretches and maintaining mental alertness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Avoid giving GTs in the last 15 days, if it causes stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

## Mindset and Health

### Forgetting Information
It is normal to forget things; this happens to everyone, including experienced faculties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Accept this as a natural cycle of reading, forgetting, and re-reading until the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Make peace with the fact that not everything will stay in your mind forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

### Note-Making for Revision
When making notes, be "miserly" with highlighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Highlight only the main 5-7 words per page that you need to revise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. This ensures that on the last day, you only read the highlighted words for quick revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

### Dealing with Tough Subjects
If you dislike or fear certain subjects (e.g., Gynecology, Microbiology, Biochemistry, Anatomy, Pharmacology), don't take it too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. You are studying them for the exam, not for a lifetime passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. Stick to [[role_of_rapid_revision_in_fmge_success | Rapid Revision]] notes, even if you have to curse them every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. If a subject is particularly weak, you can take a couple of extra days for it, but not for all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.

### Physical and Mental Health
-   **Physical Health:** Dedicate 30-40 minutes daily to physical activity, like a walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
-   **Mental Health:** Everyone has a different stress buster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. Practice deep breathing, drink water, maintain a balanced diet, and consider 10-15 minutes of meditation or yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. The main aim is to keep your heart rate normal and avoid tachycardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
-   **Sleep:** Aim for 6 hours of sleep for proper mental functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. Some may need 7 hours. The key is to wake up feeling 100% focused, not tired or mentally exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

### Overcoming Negativity and Self-Doubt
-   **Ignore rumors:** Do not listen to rumors about the exam pattern (e.g., "only USMLE pattern," "toughest in FMG history") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. These are often baseless and spread by people trying to cause tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.
-   **Focus on the controllable:** You cannot predict exam outcomes or external events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. Focus only on what you can control: your daily work and time allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.
-   **Believe in yourself:** Recognize your achievements (e.g., getting into MBBS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. Stop telling yourself you are useless or have no memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.
-   **Motivation:** True motivation comes from within; it's your dedication to change your life after January 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. Visualize your success, like giving an interview after passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.
-   **Start from zero:** If you feel like you've forgotten everything, assume you are starting from zero today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. It is 100% possible to clear [[fmg_exam_preparation | FMGE]] by studying diligently for the last 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

## Customizing the Timetable
This timetable is designed to be inclusive, suitable for those starting now or midway through preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.

-   **For higher scores (200+):** If you've already completed a first revision, you can reduce the days for some subjects (e.g., Anatomy in 2.5-3 days instead of 4, Surgery in 3 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This will free up 10 extra days for an additional round of revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.
-   **Stick to your current plan:** If you are already following another timetable that is working for you, stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. You can pick up good points from this timetable but avoid jumping ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

## Final Advice
-   All 19 subjects must be covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. If you must leave one, at least review its LRR session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>.
-   This [[daily_study_schedule_for_fmge | daily study schedule for FMGE]] and [[exam_preparation_and_strategy_for_fmge_aspirants | exam preparation and strategy for FMGE aspirants]] is applicable for first attempts, second attempts, or any situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
-   The game has just begun; don't give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.
-   Maintain positivity and believe in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
-   Your dedication is the most important factor in following this timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

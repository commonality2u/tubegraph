A follicular adenoma is classified as a benign tumor of the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Unlike conditions causing diffuse enlargement of the thyroid, a benign tumor like follicular adenoma typically presents as a localized, encapsulated nodule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. It does not cause a symmetrically enlarged thyroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Pathological Features
Histologically, follicular adenomas are characterized by the presence of small follicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Differentiation from Other Conditions
When differentiating from inflammatory conditions like [[pathology_and_characteristics_of_different_thyroid_cancers | Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], follicular adenoma, being a tumor, presents as a small nodule, typically 1-3 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>. In contrast, [[pathology_and_characteristics_of_different_thyroid_cancers | Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], an inflammatory lesion, would cause a complete enlargement of the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. Clinical aspects must always be correlated with imaging or pathological findings for an accurate diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

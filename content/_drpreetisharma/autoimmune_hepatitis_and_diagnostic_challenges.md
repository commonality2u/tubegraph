Autoimmune hepatitis is a condition where the body's immune system attacks the liver. It is an important topic for medical examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A patient with autoimmune hepatitis may present with symptoms such as jaundice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. A key indicator for diagnosis is that the patient's signs and symptoms improve and decrease following treatment with steroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.

## Diagnosis
The diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis involves several steps:
*   **Serology Tests**: Viral hepatitis markers (e.g., for Hepatitis A, B, C) are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) tests are also negative, ruling out [[Primary sclerosing cholangitis and liver pathologies | Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.
*   **Liver Biopsy**: Microscopic examination of a liver biopsy shows lymphocytes and plasma cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.

### Key Histopathological Findings
Autoimmune hepatitis typically presents with three main histopathological features:
1.  **Interface Hepatitis**: This involves inflammation at the junction of the liver parenchyma and the portal triad, characterized by an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Emperipolesis**: This is characterized by large cells that have "eaten up" smaller cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. This feature is often seen in exam photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>.
3.  **Hepatic Rosette**: Liver cells (hepatocytes) are present in sheets and form a round structure, resembling a rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

### Antibody Classification ([[Antibody Patterns in Medicine]])
Autoimmune hepatitis is classified into types based on the presence of specific antibodies:
*   **Autoimmune Hepatitis Type 1**: Associated with:
    *   Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>
    *   Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>
    *   Soluble liver antigen (SLA) antibody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>
*   **Autoimmune Hepatitis Type 2**:
    *   Often drug-induced, caused by various medications including acetaminophen and antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.
    *   Characterized by anti-liver-kidney microsome (anti-LKM) antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
    *   Specifically, anti-LKM Type 2 is a key marker for drug-induced cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.
*   **Autoimmune Hepatitis Type 3**: Also associated with soluble liver antigen (SLA) antibody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

### Differential Diagnosis
It's important to differentiate autoimmune hepatitis from other conditions with similar symptoms:
*   **Gilbert's Syndrome**: Presents with unconjugated bilirubin, whereas autoimmune hepatitis can involve conjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>. Gilbert's Syndrome is often asymptomatic, precipitating only under stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.
*   **Crigler-Najjar Syndrome**: Also involves unconjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.
*   **Dubin-Johnson Syndrome**: Presents with conjugated bilirubin and a dark pigmented liver on biopsy due to brownish pigment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>.
*   **Rotor Syndrome**: Presents with conjugated bilirubin but no liver pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
*   [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia diagnosis | Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia]]: Leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to RBC breakdown, often resolves with corticosteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   Viral Hepatitis (A, B, C): Serology tests differentiate these; viral hepatitis B may show ground-glass hepatocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>, and hepatitis C may show numerous lymphocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. Liver biopsy is typically not performed for acute viral hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.

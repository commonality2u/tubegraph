Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) is a condition characterized by low platelet counts, leading to symptoms like bruising and rashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation of ITP

A common presentation for ITP can be seen in a five-year-old girl presenting with a red rash on her limbs and easy bruising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. The rash might start and progress over about a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>. A relevant past medical history might include a minor cold two weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

Key laboratory findings in ITP include:
*   **Thrombocytopenia:** A significantly low platelet count, such as 20,000 (normal range 1.5 to 4.5 lakhs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.
*   **Normal PT and aPTT:** Prothrombin Time (PT) and activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are typically within normal reference ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

## Distinguishing ITP from Other Bleeding Disorders

### Hemophilia (A & B) and Von Willebrand Disease

These conditions are typically ruled out in cases of suspected ITP because they characteristically show an increased aPTT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>.
*   **Hemophilia A** is due to a deficiency of Factor VIII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
*   **Hemophilia B** is due to a deficiency of Factor IX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.
*   **Von Willebrand Disease** also involves a defect in Factor VIII, in addition to Von Willebrand Factor deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.

Hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive (XLR) conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>.

### Bruton's Hypogammaglobulinemia

This condition is a "BBB" disease, referring to its characteristics:
*   **B**oys: More commonly seen in boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
*   **B** cells: Defective B cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **BTK** defect: Genetic mutation involves the BTK gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.

Clinically, it presents with hypogammaglobulinemia, meaning reduced immunoglobulin levels, especially IgG, leading to defective opsonization and recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.

### DiGeorge Syndrome

Characterized by the "Catch-22" mnemonic:
*   **C**ardiac abnormalities: Often tetralogy of Fallot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **A**bnormal facies: Dysmorphic features and cleft palate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **T**hymic aplasia: Absent thymic shadow, leading to T-cell deficiency and recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **C**left palate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **H**ypocalcemia: Due to parathyroid gland underdevelopment, causing seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

The underlying cause is a deletion of chromosome 22q11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Specific testing involves FISH analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The gene affected is TBX1, which has also been associated with schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Ch√©diak-Higashi Syndrome

This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a> characterized by the "CHEDI" mnemonic:
*   **C**NS/neurological abnormalities: Delayed milestones or school problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
*   **H**emorrhage problems: Bleeding from multiple orifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   **D**ecreased **I**mmunity: Recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   **A**lbinism: Oculocutaneous albinism, specifically silvery-gray hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **K**oarse granules: Presence of coarse granules in white blood cells on peripheral smear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

The genetic mutation is in the LYST gene (lysosome defect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.

The cholera toxin (CT) is a key virulence factor produced by *Vibrio cholerae*, the bacterium responsible for cholera. Understanding its mechanism is crucial as it directly contributes to the severe "rice water stools" characteristic of the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:46">[05:30:46]</a>.

## Toxin Components and Action

*Vibrio cholerae* primarily produces two toxins:
1.  **Cholera Toxin (CT)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>
2.  **Zonula Occludens Toxin (Zot)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:50">[05:35:50]</a>

The cholera toxin itself consists of two main fragments, A and B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>:
*   **Fragment B (Binding)**: This fragment is responsible for binding the toxin to intestinal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. It specifically binds to the GM1 ganglioside on the surface of these cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Fragment A (Action)**: Once bound, fragment A enters the cell and carries out the main mechanism of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

### Cellular Mechanism

Fragment A of the cholera toxin primarily acts by activating adenylyl cyclase intracellularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This activation leads to a significant increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels within the intestinal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. The elevated cAMP levels disrupt ion and water transport in the intestines, resulting in massive fluid and electrolyte secretion, which manifests as severe diarrhea.

## Clinical Manifestations

The most characteristic clinical manifestation caused by cholera toxin is "rice water stools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:46">[05:30:46]</a>. This refers to the voluminous, pale, milky fluid passed by infected individuals, resembling water in which rice has been rinsed.

## Diagnostics for *Vibrio cholerae*

While the toxin's action is key to disease, the organism itself can be identified:
*   **Culture Media**: The specific culture medium for *Vibrio cholerae* is TCBS (Thiosulfate-Citrate-Bile Salts-Sucrose) agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Sucrose Fermentation**: *Vibrio cholerae* is a sucrose fermenter, which is indicated by a yellow color change on TCBS media due to the presence of Bromothymol Blue (BTB) as the indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. Other *Vibrio* species, such as [[vibrioparahemolyticus_kanagawa_phenomenon|*Vibrio parahaemolyticus*]], are typically not sucrose fermenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
*   **String Test**: *Vibrio cholerae* is positive for the string test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

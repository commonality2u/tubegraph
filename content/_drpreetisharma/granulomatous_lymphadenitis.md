[[Granulomatous lymphadenitis]] is a condition characterized by the presence of granulomas, often seen in a neck swelling that undergoes investigation through fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and subsequent biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Diagnostic Features

### Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)
On FNAC, the most striking feature is the presence of a [[Multinucleated giant cells | multi-nucleated giant cell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. These are large cells containing multiple nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Another key finding on FNAC is the presence of numerous cells with elongated or "slipper-shaped" nuclei, which are characteristic of epithelioid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The combination of [[Multinucleated giant cells | multi-nucleated giant cells]] and slipper-shaped epithelioid cells strongly suggests a granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Biopsy
Biopsy findings typically correlate with those seen on FNAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. In a biopsy, one can appreciate:
*   **[[Multinucleated giant cells | Giant cells]]**: Large cells with multiple nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Epithelioid cells**: Cells with elongated, slipper-shaped nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Lymphocytic collar**: Tiny blue dots surrounding the central granuloma, representing lymphocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

These three components – giant cells, epithelioid cells, and a lymphocytic collar – constitute a granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. A granuloma can sometimes be identified even without the presence of giant cells, based on the epithelioid cells surrounded by a lymphocytic collar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Caseous Necrosis
If the granuloma is caused by tuberculosis (TB), an additional feature that might be seen is caseous necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

*   **Gross Appearance**: On a gross examination of a lymph node, caseous necrosis appears as a "cheesy" material on the cut surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **FNAC Appearance**: FNAC of caseous necrosis would show a pink, granular, non-homogeneous, and "dirty" material, indicating cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

This detailed examination using [[Visual and histological pathology clues for diagnosis | visual and histological pathology clues for diagnosis]] helps establish the diagnosis of [[Granulomatous lymphadenitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

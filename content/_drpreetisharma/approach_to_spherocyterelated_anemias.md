Spherocytes are red blood cells that appear entirely spherical on a peripheral smear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. When present, it's important to investigate the underlying cause, as multiple conditions can lead to their formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Identifying Spherocytes
Spherocytes are characterized by their entirely spherical shape on a blood film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Common Causes and Investigations

### Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)
AIHA is the most common cause of spherocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis:** The primary diagnostic test for AIHA is a Coombs test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Clinical Context:** It might be suspected in cases like a primigravida experiencing spherocytes due to antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS)
Hereditary spherocytosis is another significant cause of spherocytes, particularly when there is a family history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation:** HS often presents with jaundice (indicating blood breakdown), splenomegaly (spleen breaking down red blood cells), and a classical family history, frequently showing autosomal dominant inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Diagnostic Tests:**
    *   **Screening Test:** Osmotic fragility testing was traditionally used as a screening test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   **Confirmatory Test:** The EMA test (eosin-5-maleimide) is used to confirm hereditary spherocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This test involves adding a stain to detect the condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Genetic Basis:** The most common mutation associated with autosomal dominant hereditary spherocytosis is in the ankyrin gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### G6PD Deficiency Anemia
If AIHA and HS are ruled out, G6PD deficiency anemia should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis:** Testing involves measuring G6PD levels in the patient's blood, typically done using an ELISA machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Approach to Diagnosis
*   If only a spherocyte image is presented, the initial thought should be Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   If a family history is provided along with the image, Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

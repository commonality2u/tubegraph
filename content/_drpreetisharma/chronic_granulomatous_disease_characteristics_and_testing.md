## Overview
[[chronic_granulomatous_disease_characteristics_and_testing | Chronic Granulomatous Disease]] (CGD) is a condition characterized by a defect in the NADPH oxidase enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

## Genetic Basis and Inheritance
The defect in CGD is primarily linked to a mutation in the FOX gene, specifically impacting NADPH oxidase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

The inheritance patterns for CGD include:
*   **X-linked recessive** This form is associated with a GP91-FOX mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. The mnemonic "9 plus 1 sounds like a ten, so ten looks like X" helps remember that the 91 FOX mutation is X-linked recessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Autosomal recessive** Other FOX gene mutations, such as GP47 and GP67, fall under autosomal recessive inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

## Clinical Features
Patients with CGD commonly present with recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. These infections are often caused by catalase-positive organisms like *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Candida*, and *E. coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. A consistent history of [[common_bacterial_infections_and_diagnostic_tests | catalase-positive infections]] often points towards a diagnosis of CGD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## Diagnostic Testing
Two primary tests are used to diagnose [[chronic_granulomatous_disease_characteristics_and_testing | Chronic Granulomatous Disease]]:
*   **Screening Test: Nitroblue Tetrazolium (NBT) Test**
    *   NBT is a screening test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
    *   It is sometimes remembered by the mnemonic "NBT is for small teenage couples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
*   **Diagnostic Test: Dihydro Rhodamine (DHR) Testing**
    *   DHR is the definitive diagnostic test for CGD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
    *   The association between NBT, DHR, and CGD is often linked by their three-letter abbreviations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### Ruling out other conditions
When considering a diagnosis like CGD, it is important to differentiate it from other conditions with similar presentations, such as:
*   **DiGeorge Syndrome**: Characterized by Catch-22 features, including hypocalcemia, leading to seizures, absent thymic shadow, recurrent infections (due to T-cell deficiency), dysmorphic facies, cleft palate, and cardiac abnormalities (e.g., Tetralogy of Fallot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This syndrome involves a deletion on chromosome 22q11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Diagnosis can be confirmed via FISH analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Bruton's Hypogammaglobulinemia**: This is an X-linked recessive disorder more common in boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. It involves defective B cells and a BTK gene defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Clinically, it leads to decreased immunoglobulins, especially IgG, resulting in defective opsonization and recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.
*   **Ch√©diak-Higashi Syndrome**: Characterized by the "CHEDIAC" mnemonic:
    *   **C**NS/Neurological abnormalities (e.g., delayed milestones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
    *   **H**emorrhage problems (e.g., nosebleeds, random bleeds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
    *   **D**ecreased **I**mmunity leading to recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
    *   **A**lbinism, specifically oculocutaneous albinism, often presenting as silvery-gray hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
    *   **C**oarse granules seen in white blood cells on peripheral smear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
    *   The genetic mutation is in the LIST gene, which is related to lysosome defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

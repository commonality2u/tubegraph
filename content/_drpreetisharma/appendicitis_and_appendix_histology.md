This article discusses the identification of *Enterobius vermicularis* in the appendix and the histological diagnosis of appendicitis, distinguishing it from peri-appendicitis based on the location of inflammation. The information is presented as part of a "series image of the day and MCQ of the day" available on various social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Image of the Day: *Enterobius Vermicularis* in the Appendix

The "image of the day" featured a spotter image requiring identification of a specific finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Identification of *Enterobius Vermicularis*
The answer to the spotter question is *Enterobius vermicularis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, also known as pinworm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The organ discussed in relation to this finding is the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Key identifying features of *Enterobius vermicularis* in histopathology include:
*   **Lateral Cuticular Alae**: The most crucial feature for identification is the presence of two lateral cuticular alae, which are visible as pointed projections on the worm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Location**: These worms are typically found within the lumen of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Appendix Histology**: The surrounding appendix tissue shows its characteristic lining and goblet cells, along with dense lymphoid aggregates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Clinical Relevance
*Enterobius vermicularis* in the appendix is usually an incidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. It is only occasionally responsible for causing appendicitis or acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The classical clinical feature associated with *Enterobius* infection is perianal itching or pruritus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Eggs of *Enterobius Vermicularis*
For identifying the eggs of *Enterobius vermicularis*:
*   **Collection Method**: The cellulose tape method or tape preparation technique is used to collect *Enterobius* eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Morphology**: The eggs are classically described as plano-convex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Internal Structure**: Inside the egg, a tadpole larva is visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Staining Variations**: The plano-convex egg with its tadpole larva can be observed under different staining methodologies, including ultraviolet light and Pap stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## MCQ of the Day: Differentiating Acute Appendicitis from Peri-appendicitis

The "MCQ of the day" presented a case of a 17-year-old girl with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and an enlarged appendix on [[diagnostic_imaging_in_appendicitis|imaging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Following an appendicectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, histological features revealed a dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate in the serosa layer of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The question asked for the likely diagnosis based on these [[mcq_on_intestinal_biopsy_findings|histological features]].

### Histological Criteria for Acute Appendicitis
For a pathological diagnosis of acute appendicitis, the pathologist must observe neutrophils, which are characteristic cells of acute inflammation, specifically within the muscularis propria (muscle layer) of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Histological Criteria for Peri-appendicitis
If inflammation, particularly a neutrophilic infiltrate, is seen in the serosa (the outermost layer) of the appendix, it indicates peri-appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Peri-appendicitis means that inflammation from the surrounding tissues has extended onto the appendix, rather than originating within the appendix itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Differentiating Diagnoses
In the presented MCQ case, since the inflammation was specifically noted in the serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, the diagnosis is peri-appendicitis, not acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. A common cause of peri-appendicitis in females is [[salpingitis_and_appendix_relation|salpingitis]] (inflammation of the fallopian tube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This inflammation can extend into the serosa of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Perforation of the appendix would involve the absence of a proper muscle layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Therefore, the likely diagnosis in this scenario is acute [[salpingitis_and_appendix_relation|salpingitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

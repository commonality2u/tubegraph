Effective [[time_management_and_study_scheduling | time management and study scheduling]] is crucial for FMG exam preparation, especially for the December 2024 exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This strategy is applicable for both first-time test-takers and those who previously scored below 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A detailed 60-day timetable is provided, starting from July 24th and concluding on September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This initial phase will be followed by a separate revision plan, divided into three revisions: 45 days, 25 days, and 15 days, aiming to finish by approximately December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Key Principles for the 60-Day Timetable

The [[60day_study_timetable_structure | 60-day study timetable structure]] focuses on two primary elements: Theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

*   **MCQ Practice**: Aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If you're new to daily MCQ practice, gradually increase your numbers by 15-20 per day until you reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Study Hours**: Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is essential to complete the syllabus within the 60 days, which is vital for subsequent revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The key to cracking the exam lies in the number of revisions and daily MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Single Source**: Utilize a single, consistent source for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. While combining different platforms or faculties is acceptable, ensure you stick to one chosen resource per subject for clarity and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision**:
    *   For **stronger subjects** (where you score above 80% in Q-banks), refer to Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   For **weaker subjects or topics** (where you score less than 80% in Q-banks), consult main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   Specifically, for Pathology and Microbiology, it is recommended to use only Rapid Revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## The 60-Day Subject Timetable

The syllabus is divided into four integrated blocks to facilitate understanding and integration of subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Block 1 (Interlinked Subjects)
*   Anatomy: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Radiology: 2 days (to wrap up concepts from surgery and ortho) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

### Block 2 (Basic Sciences and Medicine)
*   Pathology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> (Rapid Revision recommended for 19 hours of video content, aiming for 5 hours per day at 1.5x-2x speed) <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>
*   Microbiology: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> (Rapid Revision recommended for 16 hours of video content, aiming for 5 hours per day at 1.5x speed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>
*   Pharmacology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
*   Medicine: 6 days (made easier by completing the basic sciences first) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 2 days (overlaps with medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   Physiology: 1 day (focus on extra physiologies if covered in Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
*   Dermatology: 1 day (correlates with pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

### Block 3 (OBGY and Anesthesia)
*   OBGY: 6 days (a must) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   Anesthesia: 2 days (wrap-up for surgical branches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>

### Block 4 (Standalone Subjects)

*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

### Grand Tests (GTs)
The 60-day plan includes 58 days for study and 2 days specifically for Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Each GT day involves not only taking the test but also reviewing it thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   GT 1: September 8th (after 15 subjects are completed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
*   GT 2: September 21st (marks the end of the 60-day timetable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

## Daily Study Schedule

A structured daily schedule is recommended to maintain focus and achieve the target 8-10 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This approach utilizes "time boxing" to clearly separate study, break, and chill times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Mindset
> Embrace a mindset of "no past guilt, no future anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Focus solely on the 60-day plan. Remember, tough times will make you humble; embrace them with humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Morning Routine (1 hour)
*   Wake up: 7:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>
*   Engage in a morning routine, preferably including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air, before starting studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Study Sessions and Breaks
*   **Study Session 1**: 8:00 AM - 11:00 AM (3 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This long stretch simulates exam conditions where you sit for 2.5-3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Break 1**: 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM (30 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This is a relaxation break: close your eyes, listen to music, talk with family/friends. Avoid social media or other screens to prevent eye strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2**: 11:30 AM - 2:00 PM (2.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (Lunch & Relaxation)**: 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM (1.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Includes lunch (30 min) and time for a power nap or chosen social media/entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3**: 3:30 PM - 6:00 PM (2.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Break 2**: 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM (1 hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. A mix of physical break and social interaction (e.g., discussing studies with friends, social media use) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4**: 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM (2 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Evening Routine (Post-Study)
*   **Casual MCQ Practice**: 9:00 PM onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
    *   Create a custom module of 30 mixed questions from subjects already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
    *   This is a casual, quick test to stay in touch with past subjects; no serious note-taking or bookmarking required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. It should take about 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Wind Down**: After 9:00 PM, chill time. Engage in social media, watch a web series (e.g., 20 minutes daily), or any other relaxing activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Aim to sleep by 11:00 PM - 11:30 PM to ensure 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

This schedule provides approximately 10 hours of study time with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

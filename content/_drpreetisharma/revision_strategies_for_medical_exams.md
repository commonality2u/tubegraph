For medical exams like the December 2024 FMGE, a structured [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategy | preparation strategy]] is essential, applicable to all students regardless of their past performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The core worries among students often revolve around creating an effective timetable and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Overall Exam Preparation Strategy

A comprehensive preparation plan spans several months and includes both initial study and extensive [[revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revision]].

### The 60-Day Initial Study Plan

A detailed 60-day timetable, from July 24th to September 21st, focuses on initial content mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This plan emphasizes two key areas: theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

**Daily Study Expectations:**
*   **MCQs:** Aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. If not accustomed to this volume, gradually increase by 15-20 MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Study Hours:** Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is crucial for covering the syllabus within the 60-day period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Single Source:** Utilize a single, trusted source per subject for consistency and depth of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Video Resources:**
    *   For stronger subjects (scoring above 80% in Q-bank), use [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge_preparation | rapid revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   For weaker subjects (scoring less than 80% in Q-bank) or weaker topics, refer to main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   Specifically for [[pathology_exam_preparation_tips | Pathology]] and Microbiology, use only [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge_preparation | rapid revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. For Pathology, the PrepLadder rapid revision is 19 hours, and for Microbiology, it's 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This means approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day, watched at speeds of 1.5x to 1.75x, or even 2x for Pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Integrated Subject Blocks

The 60-day plan customizes subject order based on current exam patterns and subject integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>:

*   **Block 1:** Anatomy (4 days), Surgery (6 days), Orthopedics (2 days), Radiology (2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Block 2:** Pathology (4 days), Microbiology (3 days), Pharmacology (4 days) to build a strong foundation for Medicine (6 days), Pediatrics (2 days), Physiology (1 day), and Dermatology (1 day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Block 3:** OBGY (6 days) and Anesthesia (2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Block 4 (Standalone Subjects):** PSM (5 days, increased due to tougher questions), Biochemistry (3 days), ENT (2 days), Ophthalmology (2 days), FMT (2 days), and Psychiatry (2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

This totals 58 days of study, with an additional 2 days specifically allocated for Grand Tests (GTs) and their review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Post-60-Day Revision Plan

After the initial 60-day study period, a dedicated [[revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revision plan]] commences, structured into three phases:
*   **Revision 1:** 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   **Revision 2:** 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   **Revision 3:** 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

This brings the total preparation time roughly to December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The key to cracking the exam lies in the number of [[revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revisions]] and daily MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule (Time Management)

Effective [[time_management_for_medical_exams | time management]] involves "time boxing" — dividing time into study, break, and chill sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This schedule aims to achieve a 10-hour study day with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

*   **Morning Routine (1 hour):** Start the day with an enjoyable morning routine, including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air, before starting studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM):** A 3-hour session to train for the exam's sitting duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Break (30 minutes):** A relaxation break without social media or digital screens to avoid eye strain from video lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Activities include closing eyes, listening to music, or talking with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM):** A 2.5-hour session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. By lunchtime, 5.5 hours of study are completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (1.5 hours):** Includes lunch (30 minutes) and an hour for relaxation, a power nap, or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM):** Another 2.5-hour session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Break (1 hour):** A mixed break with 20 minutes for rest and 30-40 minutes for talking to friends, discussing studies, or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM):** The final 2-hour study session of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Nightly Custom Module (30 minutes):** Create a custom module of 30 mixed-bag questions from subjects already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This casual test helps stay in touch with past subjects without needing to write notes or bookmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Chill Time & Sleep:** Relax, use social media, or watch a web series (e.g., 20 minutes daily) before wrapping up the day by 11:00 or 11:30 PM to ensure 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## [[Exam Tips and Anxiety Management for Medical Students | Mental and Emotional Preparedness]]

During this intensive preparation period, it's crucial to adopt a positive mindset:
*   **No Past Guilt:** Erase past performance or hardships from your mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **No Future Anxiety:** Focus solely on the present 60-day plan without worrying about future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Mantra:** "This too shall pass" – acknowledging that tough times, like studying for exams, are painful but temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Embrace challenges with humility, as they build character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

The ultimate goal in the long run is developing strong clinical skills and humility in patient care, not just exam clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

For students preparing for competitive exams like the [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | FMGE exam]], incorporating [[role_of_practice_tests_and_mcqs_in_exam_preparation | MCQ practice]] is a crucial part of the overall [[medical_exam_preparation_strategies | preparation strategy]]. The key to cracking the exam involves consistent revision and a high volume of [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_previous_year_papers | daily MCQ practice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Daily MCQ Targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

Students should aim to complete 100 to 120 [[mcq_examination_tips | MCQs]] per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If a student has not regularly practiced [[mcq_examination_tips | MCQs]] before, it may not be feasible to immediately jump to 100 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Instead, the number of [[mcq_examination_tips | MCQs]] should be gradually increased by 15 or 20 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, if 50 [[mcq_examination_tips | MCQs]] were done yesterday, the goal for tomorrow should be 60-65, slowly building up to the target of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Utilizing Q-Banks for Self-Assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>

Q-banks serve as an excellent tool for self-assessment. Performance in a Q-bank can help identify stronger and weaker subjects:
*   **Stronger Subjects:** If a student consistently scores above 80% in a subject's Q-bank, rapid revision resources can be used for that subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Weaker Subjects:** If scores are below 80% in a Q-bank, it indicates weaker subjects or topics that require more in-depth study from main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   For [[pathology_and_microbiology_clinical_mcqs | Pathology]] and [[microbiology_test_preparation_strategies | Microbiology]], specifically, rapid revision videos are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Integrating MCQs into the Daily Study Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>

A structured daily plan should include dedicated time for [[mcq_examination_tips | MCQ practice]]. For instance, at the end of the day, before going to sleep, a casual [[mcq_examination_tips | MCQ test]] can be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### Custom MCQ Modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>

*   **Creation:** Use an app to create a custom module of 30 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Content:** This module should not be a mixed bag of all 19 subjects initially. Instead, it should include questions only from the subjects already completed up to that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. For example, if five subjects (e.g., Anatomy, Surgery, Radiology, Orthopedics, Pathology) have been finished, the custom module would draw 30 questions tagged from these five subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** This "casual test" helps students stay in touch with previously studied subjects, preventing them from forgetting past material as they move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. It's a quick exercise (maximum 30 minutes) to identify areas of weakness without needing to write or bookmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

Grand Tests are comprehensive [[practical_exam_instructions_and_strategies | practice tests]] that mimic the actual exam.
*   **Schedule:** Two days within the 60-day study plan are specifically allocated for Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Review:** A Grand Test isn't just about taking the test; it's also crucial to review it on the same day <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. One entire day is dedicated solely to the GT and its review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Early GTs:** Students should take their first Grand Test even if they haven't completed all subjects (e.g., after 15 out of 19 subjects are done) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The second GT is taken towards the end of the 60-day timetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

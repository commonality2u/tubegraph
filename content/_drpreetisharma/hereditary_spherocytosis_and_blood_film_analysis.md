[[diagnosis_of_hematological_disorders | Blood film analysis]] can reveal spherocytes, which are entirely spherical red blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Differentiating Causes of Spherocytes

When spherocytes are observed, it's crucial to differentiate between their underlying causes.

### Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)

The most common cause of spherocytes is not hereditary spherocytosis, but rather [[diagnosis_of_hematological_disorders | autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] (AIHA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

*   **Investigation**: The primary investigation for AIHA is a Coombs test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This is particularly relevant if the patient is a primigravida, suggesting potential antibodies leading to spherocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS)

[[diagnosis_of_hematological_disorders | Hereditary spherocytosis]] should be considered when there is a classical family history accompanying the finding of spherocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

*   **Clinical Presentation**: Patients may present with jaundice (indicating blood breakdown and increased bilirubin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen, suggesting it's breaking down red blood cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A family history of similar complaints, often indicating autosomal dominant inheritance, is a key diagnostic clue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Testing**:
    *   **Screening**: In earlier days, osmotic fragility testing was used as a screening test for HS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   **Confirmation**: To confirm [[diagnosis_of_hematological_disorders | hereditary spherocytosis]], the Eosin-5-Maleimide (EMA) test is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This involves adding a special stain to identify HS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Genetic Basis**: The most common mutation associated with [[diagnosis_of_hematological_disorders | hereditary spherocytosis]] is a mutation in the ankyrin gene, which typically follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### G6PD Deficiency Anemia

If AIHA and HS are ruled out, another consideration for spherocytes is G6PD deficiency anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

*   **Testing**: Diagnosis involves measuring G6PD levels in the patient's blood, typically done using an ELISA machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

> If an image of spherocytes is presented alone, consider AIHA first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. If a family history is provided, think of [[diagnosis_of_hematological_disorders | hereditary spherocytosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

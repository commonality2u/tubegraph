Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene amplification are crucial diagnostic and prognostic tools in cancer pathology. These techniques help identify specific molecular alterations within tumor cells, guiding treatment decisions.

## Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Immunohistochemistry is a laboratory technique that uses antibodies to detect specific antigens (e.g., proteins) in tissue samples. The staining observed in IHC, such as brown color, is often due to diaminobenzidine (DAB) [00:39:13].

## Gene Amplification
Gene amplification refers to an increase in the number of copies of a gene. This can lead to overexpression of the protein encoded by that gene, contributing to cancer development and progression [00:40:20].

## HER2neu in Breast Cancer
[[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2) is a proto-oncogene that is frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer [00:40:14].

*   **Nomenclature**: [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] is also known as HER2, ERBB2, or EGFR2 [00:40:27]. It is distinct from EGFR1 (or HER1, ERBB1), which is commonly mutated in adenocarcinoma of the lung [00:40:41].
*   **Targeted Therapy**: When [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] is amplified, targeted therapy using drugs like Trastuzumab (Herceptin) can be effective [00:41:34], [00:41:47].
*   **IHC Scoring for [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]]**:
    *   **0 and 1+**: Negative for [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] amplification. Trastuzumab is not indicated [00:42:26].
    *   **3+**: Positive for [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] amplification. Trastuzumab is indicated [00:42:41].
    *   **2+**: Equivocal. Further testing is required to determine [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] status [00:42:48].
*   **Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)**: For equivocal (2+) IHC results, FISH is performed as the next line of investigation [00:42:58].
    *   FISH uses fluorescent probes to detect specific DNA sequences, such as the [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] gene (often shown in red) and the centromere of chromosome 17 (often shown in green), where [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] is located [00:43:41].
    *   **Interpretation**:
        *   Normal: Two red signals and two green signals per cell [00:44:48].
        *   Amplified: A ratio of [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] signals to chromosome 17 signals greater than 2.2 indicates gene amplification [00:45:23], [00:45:59]. In such cases, Trastuzumab should be given [00:46:15].

## Genetic Alterations in Thyroid Cancer
Different types of thyroid cancer are associated with specific genetic mutations:

*   **Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid (PTC)**:
    *   Most common genetic alteration: BRAF V600E mutation [01:08:29], [01:09:05].
    *   Second most common: RET/PTC fusion [01:09:07], [01:13:30]. This is distinct from RET gene mutations alone, which are seen in Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma [02:24:25].
*   **Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma**:
    *   Associated with RET gene mutations [02:31:11].
    *   Part of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes (MEN 2A, 2B) [02:33:05].

## Molecular Classification of Breast Cancer
The molecular classification of breast cancer is based on gene profiling, although IHC for ER (estrogen receptor), PR (progesterone receptor), and [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] is used as a surrogate due to practical constraints [00:59:02].

*   **Triple Negative Breast Cancer**: Negative for ER, PR, and [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] [00:59:21]. Examples include Medullary Carcinoma Breast and Metaplastic Carcinoma Breast [00:59:34].
*   **[[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]]-Rich Breast Cancer**: Positive for [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]], negative for ER and PR [01:00:15]. An example is Apocrine Carcinoma [01:00:28].
*   **Luminal A and B Breast Cancer**:
    *   Generally ER/PR positive and [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]] negative [01:01:00].
    *   Differentiated by Ki67 proliferation index:
        *   Luminal A: Ki67 < 14% [01:01:24].
        *   Luminal B: Ki67 > 14% [01:01:28].
    *   Ki67 (also known as MIB-1) is a proliferation marker, with nearly 100% positivity in Burkitt's Lymphoma [01:01:54].
    *   Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (low grade) and Mucinous Carcinoma often fall into Luminal A, while high-grade lobular carcinoma may be Luminal B [01:02:59].
*   **Triple Positive Breast Cancer**: Sometimes, Luminal B cancers can also be triple positive (ER+, PR+, [[her2neu_in_breast_cancer__immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification | HER2neu]]+) [01:03:56].

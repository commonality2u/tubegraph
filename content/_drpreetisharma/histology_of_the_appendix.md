This article discusses key histological features of the appendix, including the identification of parasitic infections and the diagnostic criteria for appendicitis and [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | periappendicitis]]. The discussion is based on specific case studies and images presented in a pathology series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Enterobius Vermicularis (Pinworm) in the Appendix

The appendix can be host to *Enterobius vermicularis*, also known as the pinworm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.

### Histopathological Identification
When examining tissue samples, *Enterobius vermicularis* is identified by characteristic lateral cuticular alae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>. These are two distinct lateral projections that aid in distinguishing the worm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>. The organism may be seen within the lumen of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation
Presence of *Enterobius vermicularis* in the appendix is often an incidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:44">[05:28:44]</a>. Occasionally, it can cause [[acute_appendicitis_diagnosis | appendicitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. A classical symptom associated with *Enterobius* infection is perianal itching or pruritus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

### *Enterobius* Eggs
The eggs of *Enterobius vermicularis* are classically defined as plano-convex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:36">[04:04:36]</a>. Inside the egg, a tadpole larva can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:34">[04:25:34]</a>.
The common diagnostic technique for identifying these eggs is the cellulose tape method or tape preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:23">[03:50:23]</a>. The eggs maintain their plano-convex shape and tadpole larva appearance under various staining methodologies, including Pap stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:18">[05:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

## Basic Histology of the Appendix
The appendix lining contains goblet cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:22">[02:38:22]</a>. A key feature of the appendix's basic histology is the presence of dense lymphoid aggregates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Diagnosis of Appendiceal Conditions

### [[acute_appendicitis_diagnosis | Acute Appendicitis]]
For a definitive diagnosis of [[acute_appendicitis_diagnosis | acute appendicitis]] in pathology, neutrophils (cells of acute inflammation) must be seen in the muscularis propria or muscle layer of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

### [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | Periappendicitis]]
If inflammation, specifically neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate, is observed only in the serosa (outer layer) of the appendix, it indicates [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | periappendicitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This means inflammation from a surrounding area has extended onto the appendix, rather than originating within the appendix itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

### Differential Diagnosis
A common cause of [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | periappendicitis]] in females is [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | salpingitis]], which is inflammation of the fallopian tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | Salpingitis]] can extend to the serosa of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

A perforated appendix would not show a proper muscle layer like a non-perforated one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. Therefore, the presence of an intact muscle layer with serosal inflammation points away from perforation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

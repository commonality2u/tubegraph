Effective [[Time Management and Timetable Creation for FMGE | time management]] is crucial for success in the FMGE, especially with the exam scheduled for January 20th, providing approximately two months plus an additional week for preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This period demands disciplined and focused study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Daily Study Commitment

The minimum recommended study time is **10 to 12 effective hours per day** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
> [!tip] Effective Hours
> If you sit for 12 hours, expect an output of 10 effective hours, accounting for time waste from anxiety, panic, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Plan for an additional two hours in your schedule to compensate for potential time wastage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

## Study Schedule and Strategy

### Immediate Action
There is no "breathing space" for study; commence your course immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

### Subject Allocation (Round One)
A sample [[Daily study schedule for FMGE | timetable]] for the first round of revision before December 24th includes specific days for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>:
*   Anatomy: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>

> [!info] Customization
> You can adjust the order of subjects based on your preference or recent study, but adhere to the allocated number of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

### Managing Medicine
Medicine is a continuous journey, not a subject to be studied for 10 consecutive days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   Start medicine after finishing subjects like Biochemistry and Pathology, around November 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   Dedicate **1 to 1.5 hours per day** to medicine, consistently, until January 19th (the day before the exam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   Fix a specific time for medicine daily, regardless of other circumstances, to build discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

### Daily Targets for Pathology & Microbiology (Round Two)
For Pathology and Microbiology, specific daily targets will be provided after December 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>. These will be short 30-40 minute targets focusing on important topics likely to appear in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.

### Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)
*   Practice MCQs alongside theory **every day** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   Aim for **100+ MCQs per day** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. If this is too much, start with 50 and gradually increase by 5-7 questions daily to build speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.
*   The MCQs from your current study platform's Q-bank are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   Focus on **previous year topics**, not rote memorization of previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   Do not stop practicing MCQs in the last 15-20 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   Take a **minimum of 5 GTs** before the January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>.
*   The primary purpose of GTs is **time management** and maintaining pace (45-50 seconds per question) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>.
*   **Do not focus on scores** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>.
*   **GT Analysis:**
    *   Do not analyze correct questions or read their explanations from the text; refer to your notes for clarification if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>.
    *   Focus on **incorrect questions** and read their explanations from your source material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>.
*   Avoid giving GTs in the last 15 days if they cause anxiety, but continue practicing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>.

### Revision Strategy
*   Prioritize Rapid Revision (RR) videos and notes. Use main videos only to clarify specific doubts (e.g., a 10-minute segment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   Make your notes concise by **highlighting only 5 key words per page** for quick revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:20:00">[25:20:00]</a>.
*   [[Role of rapid revision in FMGE success | Rapid Revision]] is 100% sufficient for the [[FMGE December 2024 exam preparation strategy | FMGE exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>.
*   If you've already completed RR for all subjects, use the additional time to revise those notes more frequently, even attempting to do subjects twice in the allocated days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:01:00">[46:01:00]</a>.

## Health and Mindset

### Physical and Mental Well-being
*   Dedicate **30 to 40 minutes daily** for physical activity like walking to maintain mobility and aid mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.
*   Manage stress through deep breathing, staying hydrated, and maintaining a balanced diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>.
*   Consider 10-15 minutes of meditation or yoga to keep your heart rate normal and manage anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08:00">[36:08:00]</a>.
*   Aim for **6 hours of sleep** for proper brain functioning; some may need 7 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Challenges
*   **Accept Forgetting:** It is a natural human tendency to forget; accept it and continue the cycle of reading, forgetting, and re-reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Doubt:** Counter self-doubt by acknowledging your past achievements (e.g., clearing MBBS entrance) and logical abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:26:00">[57:26:00]</a>. Many students struggle with self-doubt, feeling they know nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:56:00">[56:56:00]</a>.
*   **Negativity:** Avoid falling into "black holes" of negativity. Steer clear of rumors or negative predictions about the exam difficulty or format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>. Your positivity should act as a shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:00">[39:47:00]</a>.
*   **External Motivation:** External motivation is short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>. Your dedication should stem from your desire to change your life after January 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13:00">[40:13:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Present:** Do not dwell on the outcome of the exam or unforeseen problems; focus on today's tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>.

## General Advice
*   **Stick to your chosen study sources.** Do not change platforms or notes at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>.
*   It is **100% possible** to clear the FMGE by studying for the last 60 days, even if you are starting from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:13:00">[41:13:00]</a>.
*   If you find a subject particularly challenging (e.g., Anatomy, Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Microbiology), you can try to finish it earlier in the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:41:00">[51:41:00]</a>.
*   If you are ahead of the proposed timetable, use the extra time for additional revisions or solving more questions, rather than changing your source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:52:00">[52:52:00]</a>.
*   Do not get overly fixated on statistics like how many questions to do per subject; focus on completing topics and the associated questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:35:00">[53:35:00]</a>.
*   While a 150+ score is the target, don't be disheartened if your GT scores are slightly lower, as platform GTs are often tougher than the main exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>. A 150+ in GTs might translate to 170-180 in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>.
*   All subjects must be covered, even if you dislike one. For difficult subjects like Gynaecology, focus on rapid revision notes and push through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:53:00">[50:53:00]</a>.
*   Previous year questions from NEET PG and AIIMS/INI CET from the last three years are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:12:00">[52:12:00]</a>.

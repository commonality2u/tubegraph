This article outlines the recent parasitology quiz content and the updated class schedule for medical students, focusing on various [[parasitology_learning_strategies | learning strategies]] and upcoming sessions in [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | pathology]], [[bacteriology_study_strategies | microbiology]], and immunology.

## Today's Parasitology Quiz
On Wednesday, a quiz consisting of 15 questions on [[parasitic_organisms_and_their_characteristics | parasitic organisms]] was conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Participants were encouraged to track their scores to monitor their progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

A new [[parasitology_study_timeline | timetable]] for classes until the first half of April has been prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Upcoming Classes
*   **Next Class:** Tuesday, March 26th, a Virology Quiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:58">[01:26:58]</a>.
*   **INI CET LRR for Path & Micro:** Three dedicated days on April 1st, 7th, and 10th for [[pathology_and_microbiology_mcqs | INI CET]]-specific topics in [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | Pathology]] and [[bacteriology_study_strategies | Microbiology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>. These sessions will cover topics like flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, meningitis, culture media, and bacterial genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.
*   **General Path Mega Quiz:** April 16th, focusing on Cell Injury, Inflammation, Genetics, and Neoplasia. Immunology will be covered in a separate session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>.
*   **Hematology:** Will be covered before May 19th after General Pathology and Immunology are wrapped up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:55">[01:24:55]</a>.
*   **Phase Two of Ultra Rapid Revision:** After [[pathology_residency_orientation_and_resources | INI CET]], the classes will move into a second phase, increasing frequency to possibly two classes per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Platforms and Resources
*   **YouTube:** Classes will continue on YouTube, particularly the PrepLadder YouTube channel for [[pathology_and_microbiology_mcqs | INI CET LRR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Telegram:** All class schedules, links, and times will be posted on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:03">[01:22:03]</a>. The daily quiz on Telegram will increase from 5 to 7-10 questions per day with audio descriptions and daily topic-wise descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### New Learning Initiatives (Starting April 1st)
*   **Short Topics from Main Videos:** Daily 2-3 short topics will be provided from main videos with specific timestamps to avoid FOMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Drug of Choice Diaries:** Daily Telegram flashcards and quizzes on pharmacology to make the subject more engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:47">[01:23:47]</a>.

### Study Advice
*   **Q Bank Importance:** For [[bacteriology_study_strategies | microbiology]], it is crucial to cover the remaining 15% of the syllabus through Q Bank practice, as videos alone may not cover everything due to the subject's depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **Exam Strategy:** Maintain focus during quizzes and exams; if a question is difficult, take a few extra seconds rather than panicking, as time can be recovered on easier questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   **NEET PG Requirements:** A minimum of five years of NEET PG preparation is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Procrastination:** Special [[pathology_and_microbiology_mcqs | INI CET]] topics that students often procrastinate on will be covered in live sessions to ensure they are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.

### Conclusion
The instructor expressed apologies for not being able to conduct [[offline_classes_for_medical_topics | offline classes]] outside Delhi this time but affirmed commitment to continuing online classes via YouTube to reach all students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:55">[01:25:55]</a>.

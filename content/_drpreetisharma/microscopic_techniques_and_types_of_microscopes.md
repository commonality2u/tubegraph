[[Basic Pathology and Microbiology Concepts | Microbiology]] and [[Pathology and Microbiology Clinical MCQs | pathology]] labs frequently utilize microscopes to visualize microorganisms and pathological specimens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Examiners often focus on the parts and functions of microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Historical Aspects of Microscopy
*   **Antonie van Leeuwenhoek** is known as the father of [[types_of_microscopes_used_in_microbiology | microscopy]] and developed the light microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Ernst Ruska** discovered the electron microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Types of Microscopes

### Light Microscope
The light microscope is a common type of microscope used in microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

*   **Light Source**: It uses transmitted light, where the light passes directly through the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Condenser**: This part gathers and focuses light rays from the light source onto the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. It contains an iris, similar to the iris of an eye, to regulate the amount of light passing through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Stage**: The glass slide containing the specimen is placed on the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Adjustment Knobs**:
    *   **Coarse Adjustment**: The big knob used for large adjustments to the stage's height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
    *   **Fine Adjustment**: The small knob used for precise adjustments to the stage's height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Lenses**:
    *   **Eyepiece Lens**: Where the observer looks, typically offering a 10x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
    *   **Objective Lenses**: These are multiple lenses located near the specimen, offering different magnifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>:
        *   Scanner lens: 4x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
        *   Low power: 10x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
        *   High power: 40x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
        *   Oil immersion lens: 100x magnification, used with oil on the slide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

*   **Total Magnification**: Calculated by multiplying the eyepiece magnification by the objective lens magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
    *   Scanner (4x objective): 4x * 10x (eyepiece) = 40x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
    *   Low Power (10x objective): 10x * 10x (eyepiece) = 100x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
    *   High Power (40x objective): 40x * 10x (eyepiece) = 400x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
    *   Oil Immersion (100x objective): 100x * 10x (eyepiece) = 1000x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
*   **Maximum Magnification**: The maximum magnification obtainable with a light microscope is 1000x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

### Dark Field Microscope
*   **Background**: Features a very dark background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Light Source**: Uses reflected light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Uses**: Ideal for visualizing very thin organisms like spirochetes or bacterial flagella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

### Fluorescent Microscope
*   **Light Source**: Utilizes ultraviolet (UV) light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.
*   **Fluorescent Dyes**: Requires the use of specific fluorescent dyes that interact with the UV light to produce a visible color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.
    *   Auramine and Rhodamine: Used for suspected tuberculosis (TB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
    *   Acridine Orange: Used for suspected malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
    *   Calcofluor White: Used for suspected fungus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **Wavelength Change**: When UV light contacts the fluorescent dye, the shorter wavelength of UV light changes into a longer, visible wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

### Electron Microscope (EM)
*   **Appearance**: Often described as looking like a "spaceship" or "space shuttle" due to its enclosed design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   **Source**: Unlike light microscopes, EM uses a beam of electrons instead of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
*   **Environment**: Electrons must be kept in a vacuum, hence the enclosed design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.
*   **Specimen Slide**: Requires a metal slide, typically made of copper, as glass is not compatible with electron beams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Fixatives**:
    *   For light microscopy: 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
    *   For electron microscopy: 2-2.5% Glutaraldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## [[Staining techniques in microbiology | Staining Techniques]]

Staining techniques are crucial for visualizing microorganisms under the microscope, especially in [[microscopy_and_pictorial_representations | pictorial representations]] for exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Gram Staining
Gram staining is a fundamental differential [[staining_techniques_in_microbiology | staining technique]] used to classify bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. It differentiates between Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

*   **Protocol (mnemonic: C.I.A.S. - Come In And Stain)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>:
    1.  **Crystal Violet**: Primary stain. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms stain purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
    2.  **Iodine**: Mordant (fixes the stain). Both remain purple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
    3.  **Alcohol or Acetone**: Decolorizer. Gram-positive remain purple, while Gram-negative become colorless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.
    4.  **Safranin**: Counterstain. Gram-positive remain purple, and Gram-negative stain red/pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   **Interpretation**:
    *   Purple/Violet: Gram-positive organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
    *   Red/Pink: Gram-negative organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

    *   Background: Blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.
*   **Variations**:
    *   **Cold ZN Stain (KinYoun or Gabett Stain)**: This variation omits the heating step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>. It is used for coccidian parasites (e.g., Isospora, Cyclospora, Cryptosporidium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
    *   **Acid Concentrations for Decolorization**:

    *   **Hot**: Hooklets of Hydatid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>.
    *   **T**: Eggs of *Taenia saginata* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

### Negative Staining
In negative staining, the background is stained, while the organism remains unstained or appears highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. This technique is particularly useful for visualizing capsules that do not readily take up stains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.

*   **Examples**: India Ink stain and Nigrosin stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.
*   **Use**: Commonly used to visualize organisms with capsules, such as *Cryptococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.

This article outlines a concise plan and strategy for the upcoming [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | FMGE December 2024 exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This strategy is applicable to all students, whether they are appearing for the first time or recently attempted the June/July session and scored below 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Core Preparation Pillars

### 60-Day Study Timetable
A specific [[60day_study_timetable_for_fmge | 60-day timetable]] has been designed, running from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Following this initial period, a detailed [[revision_strategy_for_fmge | revision plan]] will be provided, divided into three phases: 45 days, 5 days, and 15 days, aiming to cover preparation until roughly December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The exact revision dates may be adjusted once the official exam date is clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Daily Study Requirements
The [[60day_study_timetable_for_fmge | 60-day timetable]] focuses on both theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **MCQs**: Aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If current practice is lower, gradually increase the number by 15-20 MCQs daily to reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Study Hours**: Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is crucial for completing the syllabus and enabling multiple revisions, which are key to cracking the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Resource Management
*   **Single Source**: Utilize a single, chosen source (faculty, notes) for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Video Lectures**:
    *   **Rapid Revision**: For subjects where you consistently score above 80% in your Q-bank, rapid revision videos can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   **Main Videos**: For weaker subjects or topics where Q-bank scores are less than 80%, refer to main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   **Specific Recommendations**: For Pathology and Microbiology, it is recommended to use only rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The rapid revision for Pathology (PrepLadder) is approximately 19 hours, and Microbiology is 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Aim for approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day, which can be watched at 1.5x to 1.75x speed (Pathology up to 2x, Microbiology 1.5x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Subject-Wise Study Plan (Four Blocks)
The subjects are divided into four interlinked blocks to promote integrated learning and align with the current exam pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While the number of days for each subject should be followed, students can customize the order of subjects based on their strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Block 1: Anatomy & Surgical Integration
*   Anatomy: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
*   Surgery: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Radiology: 2 days (to wrap up surgical concepts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

### Block 2: Basic Sciences & Medicine
*   Pathology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   Microbiology: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   Pharmacology: 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
*   Medicine: 6 days (easier after basic sciences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Pediatrics: 2 days (overlaps with Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   Physiology: 1 day (focus on extra topics, e.g., from RR or LRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
*   Dermatology: 1 day (correlates with Pathology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

### Block 3: OBGY & Anesthesia
*   OBGY: 6 days (a must) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   Anesthesia: 2 days (to wrap up clinical branches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

### Block 4: Standalone Subjects
*   PSM: 5 days (tougher questions, requires more effort) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
*   Biochemistry: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   ENT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   Ophthalmology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
*   FMT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

This entire plan covers 58 days of study, with two additional days dedicated to Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Integrated Grand Tests
Two Grand Tests are integrated into the 60-day plan:
*   **GT Number 1**: September 8th (even if only 15 out of 19 subjects are completed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Dedicate one full day to taking and reviewing the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **GT Number 2**: September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Daily Schedule: Timeboxing
To maintain focus and avoid burnout, practice "timeboxing" by dividing your day into study, break, and chill times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

*   **Morning (7:00 AM onwards)**:
    *   **7:00 AM - 8:00 AM**: Morning routine (1 hour, including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   **8:00 AM - 11:00 AM**: Study Session 1 (3 hours straight, simulating exam conditions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
    *   **11:00 AM - 11:30 AM**: Break (30 minutes - relax, close eyes, listen to music, talk to family/friends; no social media/screens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   **11:30 AM - 2:00 PM**: Study Session 2 (2.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

*   **Afternoon & Evening**:
    *   **2:00 PM - 3:30 PM**: Mega Break (1.5 hours - lunch, power nap, use social media, watch something of choice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   **3:30 PM - 6:00 PM**: Study Session 3 (2.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   **6:00 PM - 7:00 PM**: Break (1 hour - mix of relaxation and social interaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
    *   **7:00 PM - 9:00 PM**: Study Session 4 (2 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

*   **Night (9:00 PM onwards)**:
    *   **9:00 PM - 11:00/11:30 PM**: Relax and daily MCQ module (casual, custom module of 30 questions from finished subjects to stay in touch with past material) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Watch web series, use social media.
    *   **Sleep**: Aim for 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

This schedule accounts for approximately 10 hours of study time with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. The times can be shifted for night owls, but the structure should be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## Mindset and Motivation
*   **Focus on the Present**: Let go of "past guilt" from previous attempts and "future anxiety" about what comes after September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Your journey starts fresh on July 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **"This too shall pass"**: Remember that tough times are not constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. The journey may be painful, but it will pass, leading to better days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Embrace Humility**: Difficult periods build humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. In the long run, clinical skills and humility matter more than the number of attempts it took to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

Begin your [[study_strategy_for_fmge_january_2024 | study strategy for FMGE January 2024]] with a positive mindset from July 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

This article outlines a detailed plan and [[strategy_for_fmge_december_2023_preparation | strategy]] for students preparing for the upcoming FMGE December 2024 exam, applicable to both first-time examinees and those who did not achieve a score of 150 in the recent June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Overall Strategy and Timetable

The core of the preparation revolves around a 60-day timetable, commencing July 24th and concluding September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This initial phase will be followed by a comprehensive revision plan, which includes three distinct revisions: 45 days, 5 days, and 15 days, roughly extending until December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The study plan focuses on both theory and Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Key Preparation Elements

*   **MCQ Practice**: Students should aim to complete 100 to 120 MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If daily practice is not a habit, gradually increase the number by 15-20 MCQs per day to reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Study Hours**: Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is crucial to finish the syllabus within the 60-day timeframe, which then allows for the planned three revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Revision and extensive MCQ practice are identified as key factors for success in this exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Study Resources**: Utilize a single source for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This may involve combining different faculties or notes from various platforms that best suit individual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Video Lectures**:
    *   For subjects where a student consistently scores above 80% in their Q bank, rapid revision videos are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   For subjects or topics where scores are below 80%, main video lectures should be consulted to address weaker areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   Specifically, for [[pathology_image_revision_for_fmg_exam | Pathology]] and Microbiology, rapid revision videos are advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Subject-Wise Study Plan (60-Day Timetable)

The subjects are divided into four integrated blocks to facilitate better understanding and integration:

*   **Block 1 (Integrated Clinical Sciences)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>:

    *   Psychiatry: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

This plan covers 58 days of study, with an additional 2 days allocated for Grand Tests (GTs) and their review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The first GT is scheduled for September 8th after 15 subjects are covered, and the second GT is on September 21st, marking the end of the 60-day schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Specifics for Pathology and Microbiology Rapid Revision

For [[pathology_image_revision_for_fmg_exam | Pathology]], the rapid revision in PrepLadder is 19 hours, and for Microbiology, it's 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Dividing these hours by the allocated days (4 for [[pathology_image_revision_for_fmg_exam | Pathology]] and 3 for Microbiology), this translates to approximately 5 hours of video lectures per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Watching at 1.5x to 1.75x speed (or 2x for [[pathology_image_revision_for_fmg_exam | Pathology]]) will allow for efficient completion of the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule

An [[effective_time_table_creation_for_fmge | effective time table creation for FMGE]] daily schedule is structured to maximize productivity while incorporating necessary breaks:

*   **Morning Routine**: Dedicate one hour upon waking (e.g., 7-8 AM) to a refreshing morning routine, including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1**: 8:00 AM - 11:00 AM (3 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This longer session prepares for the exam's sitting duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Break 1**: 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM (30 minutes). Use this time to relax without screens (no social media or digital sources) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2**: 11:30 AM - 2:00 PM (2.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Mega Break**: 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM (1.5 hours). This includes lunch (30 minutes) and an hour for relaxation, power naps, or optional social media/entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3**: 3:30 PM - 6:00 PM (2.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Break 2**: 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM (1 hour). Mix relaxation with social interaction/media use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4**: 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM (2 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Evening Routine & Casual MCQ Practice**: 9:00 PM onwards. Create a custom module of 30 mixed questions from subjects already completed that day. This casual test helps stay in touch with previously studied material without formal writing or bookmarking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Wind Down**: Chill time, social media, or watch a web series (20 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Aim to sleep by 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM for 8 hours of rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

This schedule provides approximately 10 hours of study with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. The emphasis is on consistency and vigilance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Mindset for Success

*   **Focus on the Present**: Let go of past academic performance or anxieties. The journey begins anew from July 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **No Future Anxiety**: Do not dwell on what will happen after September 21st; focus solely on the 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Persistence**: "This too shall pass," even if it's a tough, painful journey, like passing a kidney stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Tough times build humility, which leads to greater heights in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Long-term Perspective**: Ultimately, success in this exam is less critical in the long run than developing strong clinical skills and humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

*Balantidium coli* is a ciliated protozoan identified as the most likely causative organism when a ciliated protozoa is observed in a stool examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. The name "coli" can be associated with "cili" due to its ciliated nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Key Characteristics

*Balantidium coli* is often remembered using the mnemonic "BBB" for "big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>:
*   It is considered the largest protozoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   It primarily infects the large intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Forms and Infective Stage

Like many other parasites, *Balantidium coli* exists in two forms:
*   **Trophozoite** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
*   **Cyst** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>

The **cyst** is the infective stage, a characteristic common to almost every parasite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Nuclear Structure
Both the trophozoite and cyst forms of *Balantidium coli* are **bi-nucleated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   They possess a large, bean-shaped nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   A smaller, dot-like nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Motility
As a ciliated parasite, *Balantidium coli* exhibits **rotatory motility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, which is an important aspect of [[pathogen_identification_and_characteristics | pathogen identification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

Infections with *Balantidium coli* typically present with:
*   Bloody loose motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>
*   Fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>
*   Abdominal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
*   Diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>

## Treatment

The drug of choice for treating diarrhea caused by *Balantidium coli* is Doxycycline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

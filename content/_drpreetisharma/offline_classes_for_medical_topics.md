The categorization of two days for Pathology and two days for Microbiology is flexible based on the instructor's discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:05">[02:32:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:07">[02:39:07]</a>.

## Content and Objectives

The primary goal of these sessions is to help students comprehensively cover crucial topics and prepare for exams, particularly INI-CET which is approximately one month after the classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

The classes aim to:
*   Finish off all previous year topics (PYTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.
*   Cover all relevant [[Imagebased medical pathology questions | images]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   Address INI-CET specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:05">[02:47:05]</a>.
*   Consolidate [[General Pathology and Immunology Topics | Pathology]] and Microbiology content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:04">[02:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:05">[02:32:05]</a>.
*   Facilitate an interactive, revision-based class format, including group discussions, to ensure learning and revision are completed within the class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   Focus on question-based discussions rather than just teaching, as most content is already covered in main videos and rapid revision courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   Provide a workbook with planned content, including screenshots for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

## Important Notes for Students

*   The classes are structured to help students catch up on any backlogs, especially in bacteriology, which has been covered over three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   It's advised to stick to rapid revision resources and the question bank, as rapid revision alone is not sufficient for passing exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   The instructor apologizes for not being able to conduct classes in other cities like Hyderabad due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   Further details regarding registration and venue will be made available on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   The online "Wednesday Wisdom" and meditation sessions will continue weekly for one hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   Daily quizzes on topics like Mycobacteria and Gram-negative bacilli will continue on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   [[Parasitology Quiz and Class Schedule | Parasitology]] will be covered over two weeks, although one week is typically sufficient, to allow students to cover any pending bacteriology backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

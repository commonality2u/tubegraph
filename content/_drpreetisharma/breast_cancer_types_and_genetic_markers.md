## Overview of Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is a common malignancy, though its incidence is much higher in females than in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>. A breast biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. When a mass is palpated, if it is soft and jelly-like, it might initially suggest a benign tumor like a fibroadenoma; however, histology is crucial for accurate diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. A radial scar in the breast is another finding that can present with a central stellate scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:52">[03:00:52]</a>.

## Types of Breast Cancer

### Mucinoid (Colloid) Carcinoma
This type of breast cancer often presents as a soft, jelly-like palpable mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Histology:** Characterized by pools of mucin with tumor cells floating within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. The mucin is predominantly extracellular, though it can sometimes be intracellular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.
*   **FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology):** May reveal [[chicken_wire_blood_vessels_in_brain_tumor|chicken wire blood vessels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

### Invasive Lobular Carcinoma
Commonly seen in post-menopausal women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>, this type can present with irregular nodularity.
*   **Histology:** Tumor cells are arranged in a single file, one behind the other, resembling an "Indian file pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>.
*   **Signet Ring Cells:** May also be seen, which are cells with intracellular mucin pushing the nucleus to the periphery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.
*   **Clinical Feature:** It is important to note that invasive lobular carcinoma can be bilateral and multicentric, so the contralateral breast should also be examined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

### Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)
IDC is the most common type of breast cancer, including in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.

### Inflammatory Carcinoma
This cancer is named "inflammatory" because it presents with features mimicking an inflammatory disorder of the skin, such as dimpling and *peau d'orange* (orange peel appearance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. This is due to dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

### Other Types
*   **Apocrine Carcinoma:** Often classified under HER2-enriched breast cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.
*   **Medullary Carcinoma:** Classified as a triple-negative breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>.
*   **Metaplastic Carcinoma:** Also classified as a triple-negative breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>.
*   **Tubular Carcinoma:** Often categorized under luminal A breast cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

## Genetic Markers and Molecular Classification

The molecular classification of breast cancer is primarily based on **gene profiling** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>. However, due to technical and cost constraints, **immunohistochemistry (IHC)** is commonly used as a surrogate marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>, assessing the expression of Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), and HER2neu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.

### HER2neu Gene Amplification
*   **Alternative Names:** HER2neu is also known as EGFR2 or ERBB2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. It is important not to confuse it with EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 1), which is commonly mutated in adenocarcinoma lung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Immunohistochemistry (IHC):** Positive staining appears brown due to the use of DAB (DiAminoBenzidine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.
        *   **Scoring:** IHC results are scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+.
            *   0 and 1+ are considered negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.
            *   3+ is definitely positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
            *   2+ is equivocal, meaning it's uncertain if amplification is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.
    *   **FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization):** Performed when IHC is 2+ to confirm gene amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
        *   FISH measures the ratio of HER2neu signals (e.g., red) to chromosome 17 signals (e.g., green, which marks the centromere of chromosome 17 where HER2neu is located) <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
        *   An amplified result is indicated by a ratio greater than 2.2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
*   **Treatment:** Tumors with HER2neu amplification are treated with targeted therapies like Trastuzumab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

### BRCA Mutation
Male breast cancer is associated with [[BRCA_mutation | BRCA mutation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

### Ki67 Proliferation Index
Ki67 (also known as MIB-1) is a proliferation marker used to assess the aggressiveness of a tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.
*   **Luminal A:** Ki67 is less than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.
*   **Luminal B:** Ki67 is more than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.
*   **Burkitt's Lymphoma:** Ki67 can be almost 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

### Molecular Subtypes
Breast cancers are broadly categorized into four main molecular subtypes based on ER, PR, and HER2neu expression:

1.  **Luminal A:**
    *   ER/PR positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>
    *   HER2neu negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>
    *   Ki67 < 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>
    *   Includes types like Tubular Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a> and low-grade Invasive Lobular Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

2.  **Luminal B:**
    *   ER/PR positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>
    *   HER2neu negative (sometimes positive, leading to triple positive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>
    *   Ki67 > 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>
    *   Includes high-grade Invasive Lobular Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.

3.  **HER2-Enriched:**
    *   HER2neu positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>
    *   ER/PR negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>
    *   Includes Apocrine Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.

4.  **Triple Negative:**
    *   ER, PR, and HER2neu are all negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
    *   Includes Medullary Carcinoma and Metaplastic Carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>.

### Myofibroblastoma
A rare breast tumor that has an equal incidence in both males and females. It is sometimes referred to as an "MF tumor" due to its male and female occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>.

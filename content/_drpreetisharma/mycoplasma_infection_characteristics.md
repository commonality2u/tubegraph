Mycoplasma is recognized as the smallest known bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## Culture Characteristics
When cultured, Mycoplasma forms distinct "fried egg colonies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. These colonies are notably very small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. The fried egg colonies of Mycoplasma are specifically observed on PPLO agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Given that Mycoplasma forms the smallest colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, a special stain may be required to view them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

## Staining
To visualize Mycoplasma colonies, a specific "dying stain" is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. It is important to note that this is different from the "Dienes phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

Dermatophytes are a group of fungi that primarily cause infections of the skin, hair, and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. These organisms are known for causing localized infections rather than systemic involvement of multiple organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>. All dermatophytes affect the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.

## Types of Dermatophytes

The three main types of dermatophytes are remembered using the mnemonic TME <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>:
*   **Trichophyton (T)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>
*   **Microsporum (M)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>
*   **Epidermophyton (E)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>

### Infection Sites

Each dermatophyte type exhibits specific preferences for infection sites:
*   **Trichophyton**: The word "try" in its name signifies that it can infect all three primary sites: skin, hair, and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:43">[00:55:43]</a>.
*   **Microsporum**: "Micro" refers to smaller structures, and in this context, it indicates infection of the skin and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>, as hair is thinner than nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.
*   **Epidermophyton**: This name ends with "n", which is a mnemonic for nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. Therefore, it infects the skin and nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

## Differentiation

Dermatophytes are differentiated based on their macroconidia and microconidia morphology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>. This differentiation is typically observed using [[Fungal Staining Techniques|lactophenol cotton blue]] staining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45">[00:59:45]</a>.

### Microconidia

Microconidia are smaller spores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a> and are found in a descending order of abundance among the three types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>:
*   **Trichophyton**: Shows the maximum number of microconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>, appearing as many tiny dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>.
*   **Microsporum**: Has fewer microconidia compared to Trichophyton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, often just one tiny dot visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.
*   **Epidermophyton**: Has the least number of microconidia or they may be absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>, meaning no tiny dots are typically seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>.

### Macroconidia

Macroconidia are larger structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. Their shapes are distinctive for each dermatophyte and can be remembered by the mnemonic PSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>:
*   **P** for Pencil shape
*   **S** for Spindle shape
*   **C** for Club shape

Applying this to the TME dermatophytes:
*   **Trichophyton**: Exhibits **P**encil-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.
*   **Microsporum**: Shows **S**pindle-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
*   **Epidermophyton**: Displays **C**lub-shaped macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

### Visual Example

For example, an image showing no microconidia and club-shaped macroconidia would indicate *Epidermophyton* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

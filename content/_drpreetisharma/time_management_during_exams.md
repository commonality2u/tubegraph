With just 10 days remaining before the January 20th exam, this period is critical for FMGE students, considered a "make or break" phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The focus shifts from extensive study to strategic revision and mental preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Do's and Don'ts for the Final Days

### Subject Management
It's common for students not to have completed all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The key is to manage what's left and avoid new, in-depth studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

*   **Don't leave any subject untouched**: Aim to know a little bit about every subject to answer at least 50% of its questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **For unstudied subjects**: Instead of main videos or rapid revisions, use 3-hour LRR (Last-Minute Rapid Revision) sessions or crash courses from any platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Avoid new topics in studied subjects**: If you've covered a subject like pathology, don't start studying rare or new topics within it now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Categorize subjects**:
    *   **Short Subjects**: Head, Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensics, Dermatology, ENT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Dedicate approximately two and a half days to these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Focus on LRR sessions and previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    *   **Volatile Subjects (Giants)**: Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. These are difficult to memorize and often induce anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, but you must know at least the basics. Use LRR and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Even if you don't enjoy them, study them for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
    *   **Clinical Subjects**: Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, Pathology, Physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Similar to volatile subjects, focus on LRR videos and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Become a "scanning machine"**: In the last 9 days, quickly review everything you've read, rather than in-depth study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
The decision to take Grand Tests in the final days is personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Use GTs primarily for [[time_management_and_study_techniques_for_fmge | time management]] and identifying silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, not for judging your score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Score concern**: A low score (e.g., below 150) can cause significant panic and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. If you can't handle potential negative results, avoid taking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Alternative to GTs**: If you don't take a full GT, create a set of 300 MCQs and practice time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Analyzing GTs**: If you score low (130-150), quickly analyze *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Is it silly mistakes (requiring more MCQ practice) or knowledge gaps (requiring LRR revision)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>

### MCQ Strategy
*   **Explanation review**: Read explanations *only* for incorrect MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Briefly check if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. For knowledge gaps, superficially read 5-10 lines on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **New questions**: Expect 20-30 "bouncers" in every GT that seem new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>; don't let these demotivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Your pass/fail is decided by the topics you *know* and the silly mistakes you *avoid* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Daily MCQ target**: Aim for a minimum of 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Gradually increase your daily target (e.g., 10-15 more questions per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**:
    *   FMG's last 5 years' PYQs are mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
    *   If time permits, complete NEET PG's last 3 years' questions (2020, 2021, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
    *   If still more time, consider the IAI CET exam from November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
    *   Don't just memorize PYQ answers; focus on the underlying topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Examiners no longer copy-paste questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

### Daily Study Targets and Time Management
*   **Normalize sleep cycle**: Adjust your sleep schedule to be alert during the exam hours (morning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Minimum study hours**: Aim for a minimum of 12-14 hours of *productive* study daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This means focused study with the phone aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Divide your day into four slots**:
    1.  **Study (Theory & MCQs)**: Allocate 60% of your time to MCQs and 40% to theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Theory can come from LRR PDFs and explanations of MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
    2.  **Images**: Dedicate 1 hour daily to scanning images, especially from subjects reviewed that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
    3.  **Sanity**: Allocate 30 minutes for an outdoor activity, a light walk, or something away from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This helps avoid mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Avoid social media if it leads to extended breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Sustained focus**: The Pomodoro technique is out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch without distractions, mimicking exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

### Managing Mental Health during Exam Preparation
*   **Positivity**: Surround yourself with positive people (parents, siblings, good friends, teachers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Avoid those who brag about scores or spread illogical rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Avoid negativity**: One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Don't worry about forgetting things; everyone forgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. If you forgot something, quickly pick it up and revise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Mindset**: Competitive exams are a mix of knowledge and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Stay mentally stable and avoid going into a negative cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
*   **No new medications**: Stick to your routine; don't experiment with sleep medications or other substances before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Focus on the present**: Don't dwell on past GT scores or future anxieties (e.g., alarm not ringing, computer issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. Work in small, focused blocks (e.g., "what to study for the next three hours?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.

### Exam Day Strategy
*   **Paper difficulty**: Expect one paper to be tough and one to be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. This balance helps in overall passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Break time**: Do not discuss Paper 1 during the break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. Forget it like a "bad dream" and focus on Paper 2, even if Paper 1 felt tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

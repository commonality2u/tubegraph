## General Approach & Mindset

In the final few days before an exam, it's important to focus on specific strategies rather than traditional long study sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

*   **Prioritize Last-Minute Revision (LRR)**: Instead of watching full videos or even rapid revision sessions, concentrate on condensed Last Minute Revision (LRR) material, which can be completed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. For example, dedicate short, focused periods like 1 hour 15 minutes to subjects like Pathology and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Once reviewed, there's no need to revise it again immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Key Images and Core Concepts**: A significant portion of exam questions, particularly in subjects like Pathology and Microbiology, are based on frequently tested images and core concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. These "spotter" images are often repeated year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace Passive Learning**: If studying independently becomes difficult due to stress, engage in passive learning by listening to or watching sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain Concentration**: During study sessions, avoid asking miscellaneous doubts unrelated to the current topic to maintain focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Keep doubts for the end of the session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Straightforward Questions**: While some questions might be challenging, prioritize understanding and answering the straightforward ones that are common in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Focus on the positives rather than dwelling on negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Preparedness**: Many students experience a feeling of forgetting everything or mixing up concepts before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This is a common and often positive sign of having studied extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Trust that your brain will recall information when presented with the specific question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## [[Strategies to Manage Exam Anxiety | Managing Exam Anxiety]] and Nerves

Managing your mental state is as crucial as studying the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

*   **Breathe Deeply**: Before starting a study session or the exam, take deep breaths to calm your nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Calm Yourself Down**: Especially after receiving admit cards or experiencing increased palpitations, prioritize calming yourself down before attempting to study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Unnecessary Tension**: If you've studied well, avoid over-pressuring yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Don't create panic, as it can lead to forgetting what you've learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain a Composed State**: Success in the exam often depends on maintaining a composed state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   **Regular Short Sessions**: Attending short, regular sessions with instructors or peers can help ease tension by realizing others share similar anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Rest and Breaks**: Incorporate adequate sleep, short periods of rest, and outdoor walks into your schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

## Specific Exam-Day Tips

*   **Time Management**: Develop strategies for managing time during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Question**: When encountering a question, put your full focus on it, which helps in automatic recall and prevents distraction by thoughts about remaining syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   **No Guessing**: It's advised not to guess if you don't know the answer; instead, rely on applying what you know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

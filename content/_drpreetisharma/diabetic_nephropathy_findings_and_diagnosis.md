Diabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of uncontrolled diabetes, characterized by specific histological changes in the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A typical presentation might involve a 55-year-old female presenting for a regular health checkup with findings of uncontrolled diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Laboratory Findings
*   **CBC:**
    *   Hemoglobin: 12 (normal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>
    *   TLC: 10,000 (normal range 4,000-11,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>
    *   Differential count: No abnormality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>
    *   Platelet counts: 170,000 (normal range 1.5-4.5 lakhs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>
*   **HbA1c:** 11% (indicating uncontrolled diabetes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>
*   **Urine Analysis:**
    *   Protein: 2+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>
    *   Glucose: 3+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>
    *   Casts or crystals: None noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>

## Histopathological Findings
A [[nephropathy_and_renal_histology | renal biopsy]] is crucial for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The findings in diabetic nephropathy can be remembered with the mnemonic "the diabetic nephropathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>:

*   **T**hickening of the capillary basement membrane in the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **H**yaline arteriosclerosis affecting the glomerular arterioles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **E**pstein-Armani lesion (also known as Armani Epstein lesion), which is glycogen accumulation in the proximal convoluted tubule, notable as it is **not** a glomerular finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **D**iffuse glomerulosclerosis, where the entire glomerulus becomes pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **N**odular glomerulosclerosis (NGS), also known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson (KW) lesion, which is the most characteristic lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This involves pink, nodular material within the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **D**rop and cap:
    *   **C**apsular drop: Pinkish material dropping from the Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
    *   **F**ibrin cap: Pinkish material sitting on the capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **P**apillary necrosis: Death of the [[renal_pathology_and_genital_urinary_system_quiz | renal papilla]], common in diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Special Stains
*   **Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain:** Used to highlight the pink color of the nodular glomerulosclerosis (KW lesion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Sample Collection for Diagnosis
*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Collected in a purple vacutainer containing EDTA as an anticoagulant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   **Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c):** Also collected in a purple vacutainer with EDTA, distinguishing it from other glucose samples (e.g., fasting, postprandial, random blood sugar) which are collected in a gray vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

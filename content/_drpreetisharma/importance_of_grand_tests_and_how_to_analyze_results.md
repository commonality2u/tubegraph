Grand Tests (GTs) are crucial for exam preparation, serving as a vital tool for self-assessment and strategic improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. They help analyze a student's progress graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> and identify areas for future preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Recommended Frequency and Time Allocation
For students with a positive mindset towards GTs, taking one approximately every two weeks (fortnightly) is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. If a student tends to get demotivated by GT scores, a frequency of once every three weeks might be more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

When scheduling a Grand Test, allocate half a day for the entire process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This means approximately three and a half hours for taking the exam, and the remaining half-day for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. It's common for students to spend an entire day on a GT, with much of that time succumbing to "depression" over results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, which is counterproductive.

## How to Analyze Grand Test Results
Effective analysis of GTs involves focusing on specific areas rather than getting bogged down by overall statistics or scores.

### What to Focus On
*   **Incorrect Questions:** The primary focus should be on understanding why questions were answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This includes:
    *   Silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>
    *   Topics not known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
    *   New topics <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>
    *   Insufficient time or effort during analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>
*   **Identification of Weak Areas:** Analyze if errors stem from:
    *   Fact-based rote learning (e.g., Microbiology, Pharmacology, Anatomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
    *   Conceptual questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>
    *   Clinical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>
    This helps in tailoring future [[exam_preparation_and_strategy|preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### What to Avoid
*   **Over-reliance on Statistics:** Don't get "statistics-driven," focusing solely on the number of incorrect answers or time taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The core purpose is quality analysis, not just quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Detailed Review of Correct Answers:** Do not spend excessive time reading explanations for correct answers, as notes are already being revised daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Self-Judgment based on GT Scores:** A Grand Test is not the final analysis; it's a practice exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Do not let scores lead to demotivation or self-blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, especially if you tend to associate a GT score with your final exam rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

> [!tip] Mindset for Grand Tests
> Approach Grand Tests with the mindset that they are opportunities to identify mistakes and practice time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The goal is to learn from errors and improve, not to achieve a perfect score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Utilizing Grand Tests for Improvement
GTs are a key part of [[utilizing_grand_tests_and_analysis_for_improvement|utilizing grand tests and analysis for improvement]]. They help in:
*   **Time Management:** Practicing completing the exam within the given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Confidence Building:** Solving more questions and increasing the number of correct answers naturally builds confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.
*   **Identifying "Nightmare" Subjects:** Use GTs to pinpoint subjects that consistently cause trouble (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. These should then be addressed through focused study using main videos and extensive question practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.

> [!caution] Avoid Procrastination on Weak Subjects
> Don't postpone addressing "nightmare" subjects. Confront them directly by dedicating sufficient time (e.g., 4-5 days) to their main videos and associated question banks to overcome the fear and build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.

## Baseline Grand Test
If you have no other study plans for the day, consider taking a baseline Grand Test. This test should not be used for self-judgment, but rather to establish a starting point for analyzing your progress curve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Review only the explanations for incorrect answers before moving on to the next day's study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

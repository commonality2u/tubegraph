## Overview of Breast Cancer Diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>

A common presentation for [[breast_pathology_and_diagnosis | breast cancer]] involves a palpable mass in the breast, often noted by the patient over a period of days or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. [[diagnostic_images_and_their_significance | Mammography]] may reveal irregular densities in the breasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The definitive diagnosis of breast cancer is made through a biopsy, which identifies malignant cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Following diagnosis, a mastectomy may be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Key Microscopic Findings in Breast Cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>

*   **Indian File Pattern**: Tumor cells arranged one behind the other in a single file pattern are characteristic of lobular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This appearance is likened to "Indian army men" in a disciplined straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Genetic Basis of Lobular Carcinoma**: Lobular carcinoma is associated with a downregulation of E-cadherin protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This protein defect is linked to the `CDH1` gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Laterality**: Lobular carcinoma can frequently be bilateral and multicentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>

[[molecular_classification_of_breast_cancer | HER2 testing]] is crucial for determining treatment strategies in [[breast_pathology_and_diagnosis | breast cancer]].

### What is HER2? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>

HER2neu is also known as EGFR2 or ErbB2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. When HER2neu is positive, it indicates that gene amplification has occurred, leading to increased activity of the gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>

Immunohistochemical staining is commonly used to assess HER2 status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

*   **Stain Appearance**: A positive IHC result for HER2neu is characterized by a brown color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This brown color is produced by the stain diaminobenzidine (DAB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

*   **IHC Scoring**: Pathologists assign a score based on the intensity and completeness of membrane staining:
    *   **0 or 1+**: Indicates no HER2 amplification or genetic amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
    *   **3+**: Signifies definite HER2 amplification. Patients with this score may be candidates for targeted therapies like trastuzumab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
    *   **2+**: Represents an equivocal situation. The pathologist is uncertain whether HER2 is amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. In such cases, further testing is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

### Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for HER2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>

FISH is the investigation of choice to confirm HER2 gene amplification, especially when IHC results are equivocal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

*   **FISH Interpretation**:
    *   HER2 is typically labeled with a red color in FISH analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
    *   A normal female would show two red signals, corresponding to the two copies of chromosome 17 (where the HER2 gene is located) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   The presence of multiple red signals indicates HER2 gene amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Indications for FISH**: FISH analysis is specifically performed when the IHC score for HER2 is 2+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

[[Naegleria fowleri and amoebic meningoencephalitis]] is caused by *Naegleria fowleri*, a motile unicellular microorganism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This organism is commonly associated with water exposure, particularly dirty or "drain" water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

## Transmission and Pathogenesis
*Naegleria fowleri* typically enters the body through the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. From there, it travels through the cribriform plate to the brain via the neural root, not via the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Infections with *Naegleria fowleri* lead to primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. Symptoms include fever, headache, and vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Cases are often linked to recent activities involving water, such as swimming or diving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis involves identifying the motile unicellular microorganism in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

### Differentiating from other amoebic infections
It is important to differentiate *Naegleria fowleri* from other amoebic infections, such as those caused by *[[Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia infections | Acanthamoeba]]* and *[[Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia infections | Balamuthia]]* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   *[[Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia infections | Acanthamoeba]]*: Causes granulomatous amoebic meningoencephalitis (GAME) primarily in immunocompromised patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. Its trophozoites show spikes, and cysts are wrinkled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. It can also cause keratitis and corneal ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   *[[Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia infections | Balamuthia]]*: Can cause GAME in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. Its trophozoites are fish-shaped, and cysts are smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. *[[Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia infections | Balamuthia]]* does not cause keratitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

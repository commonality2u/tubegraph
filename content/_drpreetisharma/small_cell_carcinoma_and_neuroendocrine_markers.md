Small Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is a type of lung tumor that originates from epithelium but uniquely demonstrates neuroendocrine differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. It is known for its aggressive course and association with various paraneoplastic syndromes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.

## [[Immunohistochemistry and gene amplification in cancer | Neuroendocrine Markers]]

SCC is characterized by its positivity for specific [[Immunohistochemistry and gene amplification in cancer | immunohistochemistry]] (IHC) markers indicating neuroendocrine differentiation. These markers are consistent across various neuroendocrine tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. Key markers include:
*   Synaptophysin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   [[Immunohistochemistry and gene amplification in cancer | Chromogranin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>
*   Bombesin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>
*   CD56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>
*   CD57 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>
*   Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>

> [!NOTE] Distinction of NSE
> It is important to differentiate between Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) and Non-Specific Esterase (NSE). While Neuron Specific Enolase is a neuroendocrine marker, Non-Specific Esterase is positive in monoblasts (a type of acute myeloid leukemia cell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>.

## Histological and Ultrastructural Features

### Light Microscopy
On light microscopy, SCC often exhibits:
*   **Salt and Pepper Chromatin:** The nucleus may appear with dispersed, granular chromatin resembling "salt and pepper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.
*   **Azo Pardi Effect:** This phenomenon presents as blue-stained blood vessels, which is due to smudged DNA from broken cancer cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>. The DNA stains blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. This DNA presence can be confirmed using the Feulgen stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

### Electron Microscopy
Electron microscopy reveals the presence of neurosecretory granules, which appear as black-colored granules within the cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. These are characteristic of neuroendocrine tumors.

## Clinical Characteristics
Small Cell Carcinoma is associated with:
*   **Aggressive Course:** It is known for its rapid progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.
*   **Paraneoplastic Syndromes:** SCC has the highest association with paraneoplastic syndromes among lung cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis
In contrast to SCC, adenocarcinoma is positive for mucin markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.

Dr. Preeti Sharma provides a detailed [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | plan and strategy]] for the upcoming December 2024 [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | FMGE exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | strategy]] is applicable to all students, whether appearing for the first time or those who did not achieve a 150+ score in the June/July session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Core Principles for the 60-Day Plan

The core of this [[fmge_exam_preparation_tips | preparation strategy]] revolves around a [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | 60-day timetable]] from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Following this, a structured [[revision_techniques_for_fmge_exam | revision plan]] will be introduced, comprising three phases: 45 days, 25 days, and 15 days, roughly leading up to December 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Key Study Elements
*   **Theory and MCQs**: The [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | timetable]] integrates both theory and MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **MCQ Practice**: Aim for 100 to 120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If you're new to MCQ practice, gradually increase your daily count by 15-20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Study Hours**: Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours of study per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This is crucial for completing the syllabus and enabling multiple revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Single Source**: Use a single source for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Customize your sources based on which faculty and notes you understand best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision**: For subjects where you score above 80% in your Q bank, use [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | Rapid Revision]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. For weaker subjects (less than 80% in Q bank), refer to main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For Pathology and Microbiology, [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | Rapid Revision]] videos are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Subject Block Breakdown
The subjects are divided into four integrated blocks to help with correlation:
*   **Block 1**: Anatomy (4 days), Surgery (6 days), Orthopedics (2 days), Radiology (2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Block 2**: Pathology (4 days), Microbiology (3 days), Pharmacology (4 days), Medicine (6 days), Pediatrics (2 days), Physiology (1 day), Dermatology (1 day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Block 3**: OBGY (6 days), Anesthesia (2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Block 4**: PSM (5 days), Biochemistry (3 days), ENT (2 days), Ophthalmology (2 days), FMT (2 days), Psychiatry (2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

This [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | 58-day plan]] also includes two days for Grand Tests (GTs), which should include giving the test and reviewing it on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## The 60-Day Mindset: No Past Guilt, No Future Anxiety

Your [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | life begins as a new journey]] from July 24th, focusing solely on the [[60day_study_timetable_for_fmge_december_2024 | 60-day plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Avoid dwelling on past scores or hardships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, and do not get caught up in future [[overcoming_anxiety_and_staying_motivated_during_fmge_preparation | anxiety]] about what happens after September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## A Day in Your Life: Structured Study Slots

Effective [[time_management_and_study_schedule_for_fmge | time management]] involves "time boxing" â€“ dividing your day into study, break, and chill times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Morning Routine (7:00 AM - 8:00 AM)
*   Take one hour to enjoy your morning routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   Include about 20 minutes of outdoor activity, like a walk, for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)
*   Sit down to study by 8:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   This is your first 3-hour study session, building endurance for the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Short Break (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM)
*   A 30-minute break to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   Avoid social media or other screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Close your eyes, listen to music, or talk to family/friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

### Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM)
*   A 2.5-hour study session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. By lunchtime, you've completed 5.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM)
*   A well-deserved 1.5-hour break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   Includes lunch (around 30 minutes), a power nap, or watching something of your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Social media is permitted here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM)
*   Another 2.5-hour study session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Long Break (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)
*   A 1-hour break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   This can be a mix of relaxing and social activities, including talking to friends, discussing studies, or using social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

### Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM)
*   Your last study session, 2 hours long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. The time is reduced as you get tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Evening Custom MCQs (Anytime 9:00 PM - 11:00 PM)
*   Before sleeping (aim for 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM to get 8 hours of sleep) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   Lie down and casually do a custom module of 30 questions from subjects you've already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   No need to write or bookmark; just review correct and incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This helps you stay in touch with past subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Wind Down (Until Sleep)
*   Chill, use social media, or watch a web series (e.g., 20 minutes daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   Wrap up your day by 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   This schedule provides a 10-hour study routine with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## Final Mantra
Adopt the mantra: "No past guilt, no future [[overcoming_anxiety_and_staying_motivated_during_fmge_preparation | anxiety]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Remember, "this too shall pass," even if it feels painful like a kidney stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Tough times build humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, and in the long run, clinical skills and humility matter more than the number of attempts to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

Customize this [[time_table_for_fmge_preparation | timetable]], get your study materials ready, and begin with a positive mindset on July 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

Kickstart Morning Sessions are designed as early morning study sessions aimed at encouraging students to wake up early and begin their study day promptly, preventing excessive sleeping and lazing around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Purpose and Format

These sessions are intended to provide a structured discussion platform where students can quickly review topics they have studied the previous day. The goal is to save energy by covering material efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Unlike typical theory classes, Kickstart Morning Sessions will primarily feature [[active_recall_techniques | MCQ-based discussions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This approach aims to address "NEET the Length Integrated Questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. While originally conceived for 7:30 AM, the exact timing can be flexible to accommodate students who prefer waking up a bit later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Commencement and Preparation

The Kickstart Morning Sessions will not begin immediately. Students are advised to first complete one full round of Pathology and Microbiology using their [[utilizing_rapid_revision_notes_and_custom_modules | Rapid Revision (RR) videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The rationale behind this staggered start is to prevent sessions from feeling like an initial introduction to the subjects, which would be a waste of time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Once students have completed this initial review, they will be given specific daily targets for topics to read, and then these topics will be discussed in the morning sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

The platform for these sessions will be YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:11">[02:07:11]</a>. The schedule for these sessions will not be daily, but rather designed to allow students a few days to finish topics before a quiz-based discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:31">[02:07:31]</a>.

If additional information beyond the Rapid Revision for Pathology and Microbiology is deemed necessary, it will be covered in the Kickstart Morning Sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:29">[02:09:29]</a>.

Students are encouraged to complete their initial review by December, after which the Kickstart Morning Sessions will commence to provide updates and quiz-based discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:09">[02:50:09]</a>.

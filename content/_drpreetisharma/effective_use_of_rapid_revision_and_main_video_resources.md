From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

Effectively utilizing both rapid revision and main video resources is crucial for NEET PG exam preparation. The approach should be tailored to individual needs, subject difficulty, and current confidence levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

## Target Audience
This session primarily focuses on students appearing for NEET PG on March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. A separate session was conducted for FMGE students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Daily Targets and Kickstart Morning Sessions
Daily targets for Pathology and Microbiology will be provided via a Google Sheet, listing topics to cover from [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_neet_pg | Rapid Revision (RR) videos]] or other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. For interns, these daily targets for Path and Micro can be integrated into busy schedules, such as while working or performing routine tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

The "Kickstart Morning" sessions, designed to encourage early study, will begin *after* students complete one round of Path and Micro using their RR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. These sessions will focus on MCQ-based discussions to integrate knowledge effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Choosing Between Rapid Revision (RR) and Main Videos

### When to Prioritize Rapid Revision
If you have already covered 85-90% of a subject from any source, [[rapid_revision_vs_main_videos_for_neet_pg | Rapid Revision]] is generally advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. RR is excellent for month-end revision when complemented with other study methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.

### Subjects for Main Videos
For certain subjects, especially those that are bulky, deadly, or frequently yield complex questions, referring to main videos is recommended, even with limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. These include:
*   **Final Year Subjects:** Medicine, Surgery, OBG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **PSM:** Often has "crooked" and atypical questions that may require in-depth understanding beyond rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Anatomy:** If you are weak in Anatomy, jumping directly to RR can be counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Other Scary Subjects:** For subjects that cause significant fear or lack of confidence (e.g., Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology), using main videos can help overcome this apprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.

### Addressing "Nightmare" Subjects
Identify your top three "nightmare" subjects (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. Dedicate sufficient time (e.g., four to five days) to these subjects, reviewing them thoroughly from main videos or notes and solving their Q-banks to build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. The goal is to eliminate the fear associated with these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

## Integrating Study Resources

### Question Practice
Daily practice is essential, aiming for 100-150 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. For Round 1 of [[Exam preparation and strategy | exam preparation]], focus on subject-wise and topic-wise questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. While main videos are used for certain subjects, Q-banks should be integrated directly into the study plan; there are no separate days allocated for Q-bank practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

*   **Bulky Subjects:** For subjects like Medicine, Surgery, Gynaecology, PSM, Anatomy, and Pharmacology, aim to cover the full Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.
*   **Short Subjects:** For shorter subjects, the RR Q-bank can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Topics (PYTs)/PYQs:** Focus on PYTs, as they are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. For NEET PG, review at least five years of PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. For INI CET, review three years of PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. For FMGE, watching specific PYQ discussion sessions (e.g., 2-2.5 hour videos covering five years of questions) is an efficient method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. Relying *only* on PYQs for a good rank is not sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
Allocate half a day for grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The focus should be on quick analysis:
*   Do not read explanations for correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   Thoroughly analyze incorrect answers to identify root causes (silly mistakes, unknown topics, new concepts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   Avoid being overly statistics-driven (e.g., focusing only on number of incorrect questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The primary purpose of a GT is to understand *why* you got something wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   Frequency: Ideally, one GT every two weeks, assuming a positive mindset towards analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. If GTs lead to demotivation, consider once every three weeks until the mindset shifts to using them for mistake identification and [[Daily Study Targets and Time Management | time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   Baseline GT: Give a GT on the first day of the new timetable to establish a baseline for progress analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

### Last-Minute Revision (LRR)
Last-Minute Revision (LRR) sessions are available, including those conducted on YouTube, which can cover FMGE PYQs for NEET PG students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The main NEET PG LRR sessions will be conducted in January and February, with PDFs for repeated revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Overall Timetable and Customization
A comprehensive timetable is provided, spanning three rounds of revision until the exam on March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This timetable accounts for potential backlogs, emergencies, and periods of anxiety by including "pending" days and ample time for subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

*   **Medicine:** Integrate 1.5-2 hours of Medicine study daily alongside other subjects to ensure continuous coverage and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Customization:** The timetable is flexible. Reduce days for subjects if following RR, especially if confident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Utilize saved time for question practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **Interns:** Follow the same subject sequence, but add one extra day per subject when using [[rapid_revision_techniques_for_fmge | Rapid Revision]] and Q-bank as primary sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Prioritize completing short subjects during less busy postings to build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   **Study Hours:** An output of 10-11 hours of pure study per day is considered excellent and should not be increased under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.
*   **Integrated System:** Avoid using integrated system-wise timetables (e.g., 10 systems over 60 days) as they often leave out significant portions of the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Daily Medicine study and GTs help achieve integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.
*   **Crash Courses/BTR:** These can be used as supplementary tools for quick compilation and boosting confidence, but should not replace core [[revision_plan_and_strategies_for_fmge | revision]] methods like RR, Q-banks, and GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

Overall, the key is to be practical, identify your weak areas, and use the appropriate resources (main videos for in-depth understanding, RR for consolidation) alongside consistent question practice and grand test analysis. Avoid self-blame and focus on taking consistent action towards your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

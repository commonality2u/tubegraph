The string test is a diagnostic procedure primarily performed to identify *Giardia lamblia* infections in patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:55">[07:42:55]</a>. This test is specifically designed for detecting small intestinal infections, typically by examining duodenal contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:46">[08:31:46]</a>.

## Purpose and Procedure

The test aims to collect duodenal contents where *Giardia lamblia* tends to reside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:52">[08:03:52]</a>.

### Procedure
1.  **Capsule Ingestion**: The patient swallows a capsule containing a string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:57">[07:53:57]</a>.
2.  **Duodenal Placement**: The capsule travels down to the duodenum, while the string remains outside the patient's mouth, often taped in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:04">[08:06:04]</a>.
3.  **Collection**: After a sufficient period, the string is carefully pulled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:28">[08:13:28]</a>.
4.  **Microscopic Examination**: The contents collected on the string from the duodenum are then examined under a microscope to visualize *Giardia lamblia* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:25">[08:15:25]</a>.

## Differentiation from Other String Tests

It is important to distinguish the patient-based string test for *Giardia lamblia* from other "string tests" performed in a microbiology laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:07">[08:42:07]</a>. Laboratory string tests are typically conducted for different bacteria, such as *Vibrio cholerae* (associated with rice water stools) and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:19">[08:51:19]</a>. These laboratory tests are performed on cultures or plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:16">[08:59:16]</a>.

Success in exams, particularly high-stakes ones like the FMGE, is not solely dependent on academic preparation but also significantly influenced by one's mental state, faith, and belief in oneself. Maintaining a positive outlook and confidence can profoundly impact performance and help manage [[handling_exam_anxiety_and_motivation_tactics | exam anxiety]].

## Cultivating a Positive Mindset

Before the exam, it's normal to experience increased heart rate and palpitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The key is to manage these feelings and approach the exam with a calm and confident demeanor. A crucial aspect of [[exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation]] is to mentally prepare by adopting a positive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Instead of dwelling on potential difficulties, repeatedly affirm that the "paper is going to be easy" and focus on avoiding silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### The Power of Faith and Blessings

Belief in a higher power, the universe, or the blessings of parents and teachers can provide immense support and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Praying and counting blessings can help maintain the conviction that "nothing bad is going to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   This mindset helps normalize heart rate and prevents silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   Embrace any personal superstition or belief that provides security and assurance, as it can act as a mental anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. This faith helps ward off negativity and attracts positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Overcoming Self-Doubt and Negativity

It is common for students to experience self-doubt, feeling like they haven't studied enough or have forgotten everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This negativity can lead to increased [[managing_exam_anxiety_and_stress | anxiety]] and poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Strategies to Combat Negative Thoughts:
*   **Promise Positivity:** Commit to thinking only positive thoughts until the exam concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Believe in Yourself:** Recall instances where you have performed well, such as answering questions correctly in live sessions, which demonstrates your underlying knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Often, the first gut feeling is correct because it's untainted by excessive pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Manage Expectations:** Understand that passing is the primary goal (e.g., crossing 150 marks), and anything beyond that is a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Accept Human Error:** Recognize that a few silly mistakes are inevitable human errors and should not be taken too seriously or amplified by panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Maintaining Confidence During the Exam

The exam environment can be challenging, but a strong mental approach is vital.
*   **Ignore Bouncers:** Some questions (around 10-20 per paper) are intentionally difficult or from obscure sources and are not meant to be solved by everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Do not focus on these "bouncers" as they can demoralize you and lower your [[importance_of_maintaining_positivity_and_confidence | motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Solvable:** Concentrate on the easier questions and avoid silly mistakes on them, as these are the most regrettable errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **One Question at a Time:** Employ a "switch on, switch off" mode for each question, focusing solely on the current question and then moving on without dwelling on past or future ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut Feeling:** Do not overthink or change answers in the final moments out of panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Your first gut feeling is often correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Confidence, Not Overconfidence:** Be extremely confident ("I am the best") until you sit in front of the computer screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Once the exam starts, maintain a sane and practical mind, reading every question and option carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Broader Perspective

It's essential to remember that an exam is just one challenge in life. While it may seem like the most important thing at the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, your worth is not defined by this single test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. True supporters, like family and teachers, recognize your hard work regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Approach it as a formality rather than a life-defining moment, trusting that you are already doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

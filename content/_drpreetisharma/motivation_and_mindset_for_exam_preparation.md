A critical aspect of preparing for the FMG exam, whether it's your first attempt or you're aiming to improve a previous score, is establishing a positive mindset and maintaining consistent motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Beyond just the study plan, your [[Positive mindset for exams | mindset]] will significantly impact your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Overcoming Past Guilt and Future Anxiety
To effectively prepare, it's essential to let go of past performance and focus solely on the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This means erasing any negative thoughts about previous scores or hardships experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Your preparation should begin as a "New Journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Similarly, avoid dwelling on "future anxiety" about what will happen after the current study period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Your entire focus should revolve around the immediate 60-day plan, free from "past guilt" or "future anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This approach helps settle your mind for effective study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Grit, Determination, and Consistency
While it may seem obvious, grit and determination are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. No matter how well-structured a timetable is, it's useless if you're not willing to follow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Consistency and vigilance are crucial throughout the preparation period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

The key to cracking the exam lies in the number of revisions and the daily practice of MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. An average of 8-10 hours of study per day is necessary to complete the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Balancing Study with Well-being
Even with a rigorous schedule, it's important to integrate breaks to maintain [[Maintaining mental and physical health during exam preparation | mental and physical health]].

### Daily Routine Structure
A balanced daily routine can help sustain motivation and prevent burnout:
*   **Morning Routine (1 hour):** Start your day by enjoying a morning routine, possibly including 20 minutes outdoors for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Study Sessions:**
    *   **First Session (3 hours):** Aim for 3 hours of continuous study, mimicking exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
    *   **Short Break (30 minutes):** This break should involve relaxing activities like closing your eyes, listening to music, or talking to family/friends, avoiding social media or other screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   **Second Session (2.5 hours):** Another focused study period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (1.5 hours):** After lunch, take a significant break for relaxation, which can include a power nap or using social media/watching something of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Third Session (2.5 hours):** Continue studying in the afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Good Break (1 hour):** A longer break for discussion with friends or social media use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Fourth Session (2 hours):** The final study session of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Daily McQ Practice and Relaxation
*   **Nightly Custom Module (30 minutes):** Before ending your day, casually practice 30 MCQs from subjects already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This helps stay in touch with past subjects without the pressure of a formal test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **Unwinding:** Dedicate time to chill, use social media, or watch a web series for 20 minutes to relax before sleeping by 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM, ensuring 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## The Mantra: "This Too Shall Pass"
Embrace the mantra "This two Shall Pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Understand that the journey may be painful and tough, like passing a kidney stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. However, remember that no ups or downs in life are constant; everything changes, and better days will come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This testing time is meant to strengthen you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Tough times foster humility, which is essential for achieving greater heights in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. In the long run, what matters most are your clinical skills and humility, not the number of attempts it took to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

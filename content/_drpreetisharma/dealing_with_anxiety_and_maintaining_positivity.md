For students preparing for high-stakes exams like the FMG, NEET PG, and IAI CET, managing anxiety and maintaining a positive mindset are crucial in the final days of preparation. These last days are considered "make or break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Recognizing Anxiety and its Impact
Many students feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of subjects and the feeling that they haven't finished everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This can lead to significant panic and anxiety, potentially hindering study efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Feelings of exhaustion and depression can also lead to excessive sleep, further impacting productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

It's crucial to understand that competitive exams in India assess not just knowledge, but also one's mindset and approach to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Mental stability and avoiding negativity are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ answer, as it makes the mind forget information due to unnecessary worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

## Strategies for [[importance_of_maintaining_positivity_and_confidence | Maintaining Positivity]]
At this critical juncture, focusing on [[importance_of_maintaining_positivity_and_confidence | positivity]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Selective Social Interaction**: Engage only with individuals who provide positive vibes, such as parents, siblings, or good friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Ignoring Rumors**: Steer clear of people who boast about multiple revisions or high scores, or those who spread illogical rumors about exam difficulty or pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Ignore all rumors and focus solely on positive influences like family, friends, and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Avoid Negative Thought Processes**: Do not allow negative thoughts to enter your mind, as a single wasted day can mean losing ground on two or three subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Beyond positive social circles, specific strategies can help mitigate anxiety:
*   **Time for Sanity**: Allocate about 30 minutes daily for "sanity" â€” an activity away from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This could be a light walk, spending time with friends, or even watching social media reels, as long as it provides a mental break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This practice helps prevent mental exhaustion and maintains a semblance of normalcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. It's best to engage in outdoor activities and keep phones and books aside to avoid distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Normalize Sleep Cycle**: Gradually normalize your sleep cycle to align with exam times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Aim for a minimum of six hours of sleep to ensure your brain functions optimally and you remain alert during morning exam hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Avoid sleepless nights or trying new medications close to the exam, as this can negatively impact performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

### [[handling_grand_test_anxiety_and_score_analysis | Handling Grand Test Anxiety and Score Analysis]]
Giving Grand Tests (GTs) in the final days is a personal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. While strong-hearted individuals might take them, the panic and anxiety from a low score can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. If you do take a GT:
*   **Focus on Time Management**: Prioritize time management to ensure you can complete all 300 questions within the allotted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Identify Silly Mistakes**: Use GTs to catch and understand where you are making silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This indicates a need for more MCQ practice, especially if you're reading questions carelessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Focus on Scores**: Avoid focusing on whether you crossed 150 marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Your primary targets are time management and identifying silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. GT scores at this point are not a concern; the focus should be on how to best utilize the remaining days to cross 150+ in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.

### Dealing with Unfamiliar Questions
It's normal for GTs and the actual exam to contain 20-30 "bouncers" or new questions you've never encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. These are designed to prevent overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. Your pass or fail is not decided by these difficult questions, but by your performance on familiar topics and your ability to avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

If you get an MCQ correct, do not read the explanation; you already know the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. If you get one wrong, superficially read the explanation to understand if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Briefly read 5-10 lines on the topic and move on, without delving into a "PhD" on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Mindset and Focus
It's normal to feel exhausted or forgetful; no one can memorize all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. If you find yourself forgetting, simply pick up the topic and revise it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Don't let feelings of boredom or disinterest deter you; this is a "survival mode" phase where studying, regardless of enjoyment, is necessary to pass the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.

Avoid dwelling on future uncertainties like alarm clocks, travel to the exam center, or equipment malfunctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. Block out these negative possibilities, as there's no end to such worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

During the exam, remember that one paper might be tough and the other easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>. If the first paper is difficult, disconnect from it during the break and don't discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. Move on to the second paper without the backlog or hangover of the first, trusting that the balance will lead to an overall passing score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

Focus on working in short, manageable boxes (e.g., three hours of study, then a short break) rather than thinking about your condition five days from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. Prioritize what needs to be done in the immediate next few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

## The Importance of Sleep
While maximizing study hours is important, do not sacrifice sleep. A minimum of six hours of sleep is necessary for the brain to function effectively and for sustained mental clarity until the exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Do not attempt to go without sleep or take medications to stay awake, as this can lead to going "blank" during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Maintain your regular routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## Conclusion

During the critical final days leading up to an exam, managing anxiety and maintaining a positive mindset are crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This period, often called "make or break," requires a specific approach to study, self-care, and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Strategies for Managing Anxiety

### Embrace Positivity
Cultivating a positive mindset is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Surround Yourself with Support:** Only talk to people who offer positive vibes, such as parents, siblings, or good friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Teachers who guide you are also sources of positive advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Avoid Negativity:** Stay away from individuals who might induce panic or anxiety by boasting about their preparation or spreading illogical rumors about the exam's difficulty or pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Block Negative Thoughts:** Do not allow negative thought processes to enter your mind, as one wasted day can affect multiple subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Remember, one negative thought is equivalent to one incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. Unnecessary thoughts will make your mind forget important information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>.

### Normalizing Your Sleep Cycle
As the exam is conducted during the daytime, it is essential to normalize your sleep cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Being alert in the morning hours is crucial for solving questions with full attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Aim for a minimum of six to eight hours of sleep to ensure your brain functions effectively until the exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Avoid sleepless nights or experimenting with medications, as this can lead to going blank during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Maintain your regular routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Managing Grand Tests and Mock Scores
The decision to give a grand test in the final days is a personal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Time Management:** If you do give a grand test, focus on [[time_management_and_exam_anxiety | time management]]—ensuring you can finish the 300 questions within the allotted time—rather than obsessing over the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Identify Silly Mistakes:** Use grand tests to catch and learn from your silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. If you are making silly mistakes, it indicates a need to read questions more carefully and practice more MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Panic:** A score below 150 in a grand test can induce panic and anxiety, hindering further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. If you know you cannot handle the pressure of a low score, it may be better to avoid a grand test in the final days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Instead, create custom sets of 300 MCQs to practice [[time_management_and_exam_anxiety | time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Don't Over-Analyze New Questions:** Expect 20-30 "bouncers" or new questions in any grand test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Your pass or fail is not decided by these questions but by how well you handle known topics and avoid silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. If a question is new, superficially read 5-10 lines about it and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Managing Study Exhaustion and Forgetfulness
*   **Combat Exhaustion:** Feeling sleepy often indicates mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Acknowledge that a little increased sleep during such times is normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
*   **Accept Forgetting is Normal:** It's impossible to memorize all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Everyone forgets, and competitive exams test your mindset as much as your knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. If you forget something, simply revise it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Avoid letting forgetfulness lead to [[addressing_exam_anxiety_and_motivation_challenges | depression or negativity]], which can negatively impact your score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

### Self-Care and Breaks
Allocate dedicated time for self-care to maintain sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Sanity Breaks:** Dedicate 30 minutes daily to an activity away from books, such as a light walk or watching social media reels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This helps prevent mental exhaustion and makes life feel more normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   **Mindful Breaks:** Be disciplined about these breaks, ensuring 30 minutes doesn't turn into three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Outdoor activities are recommended to keep phones and books aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Longer Study Stretches:** In the final days, shift from Pomodoro technique to longer study durations. Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours at a stretch without distractions to simulate exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.

## Maintaining Focus in the Final Days

### Strategic Subject Management
*   **Scan, Don't Deep Dive:** In the last nine days, your goal is to become a "scanning machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Quickly review everything you've already studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Remaining Subjects:**
    *   **Short Subjects:** Dedicate about 2.5 days to short subjects like ENT, Radiology, Ortho, Anesthesia, and Forensic Medicine, focusing on LRR sessions and Previous Year Questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   **"Giant" Volatile Subjects:** For subjects like Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM, which are difficult to remember, focus solely on LRR sessions and PYQ topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   **Clinical Subjects:** For subjects like Medicine, Pathology, and Physiology, prioritize PYQ topics and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Leave No Subject Behind:** Do not completely abandon any subject, even if it's large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. Aim to know at least a little bit about every subject so you can answer some questions from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Even for challenging subjects like Pharmacology, aim to solve at least 50% of the questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

### Daily Study Structure
Divide your study day into four slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>:
1.  **Theory:** Focus on LRR PDFs and crash courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
2.  **MCQs:** This is crucial for practicing and understanding concepts. Allocate 60% of your study time to MCQs and 40% to theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Aim to do a minimum of 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
3.  **Images:** Dedicate one hour daily to quickly scanning images related to the subjects you studied that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
4.  **Sanity:** (As described above) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>

### Last-Minute Revisions
*   **Volatile Subjects:** On the day before the exam, focus on volatile subjects and topics you tend to forget, like biochemistry cycles, microbiology classifications, or pharmacology drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.
*   **PYQs and LRR:** The very last day should be dedicated only to PYQs and LRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:3:37">[00:3:37]</a>.

### Exam Day Mindset
*   **Separate Papers:** Remember that one paper might be tough and the other easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>.
*   **No Discussion During Break:** Do not discuss Paper 1 during the break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. Forget it like a bad dream and approach Paper 2 with a fresh mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. A negative hangover from Paper 1 can negatively impact your performance in Paper 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Survival Mode:** The last nine days are about survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. Don't worry about whether you enjoy studying a subject; just do it to pass the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Present:** Work in small, manageable boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. Focus only on what you need to do in the next three hours, not on future anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Preparation:** If you're consistently scoring well in mock tests (e.g., 170-190+), trust your current strategy and continue with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. Do not doubt yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Keep studying without worrying about memory retention; your goal is to simply work in short, focused blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>.

This article outlines crucial strategies for FMG students with approximately 10 days remaining until their January 20th exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It focuses on effective [[time_management_and_daily_study_schedule | time management]] and study techniques, emphasizing "do's and don'ts" for this critical period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Last 10-Day Strategy: Do's and Don'ts

*   **Prioritize Existing Knowledge**: Do not start studying entirely new, major subjects if they are unattempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The goal is to know "a little bit of every subject" to solve at least 50% of questions from it, rather than attempting a PhD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **For Leftover Subjects**: For subjects never studied (e.g., Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensics), focus on LRR (Last Minute Rapid Revision) sessions (approx. 3 hours) or crash courses from any platform or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Avoid New Topics in Studied Subjects**: Do not delve into new, rare topics within subjects you have already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Normalize Sleep Cycle**: Adjust your sleep schedule to be alert during exam hours (morning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs)**:
    *   Giving a GT in the last 9 days is a personal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   If you can handle potential low scores positively, go ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   The primary focus of GTs should be on [[time_management_and_study_hours_for_exams | time management]] (completing 300 questions within the given time) and identifying [[managing_study_stress_and_maintaining_discipline | silly mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Do *not* focus on the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **MCQ Strategy**:
    *   If an MCQ is correct, do not read the explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   If an MCQ is wrong, superficially read the explanation (5-10 lines) to understand if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   Do not get demotivated by 20-30 "new" or "bouncer" questions in every GT; these do not determine your pass/fail status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Positivity and Avoiding Negativity**:
    *   Engage only with people who provide positive vibes (parents, siblings, good friends, teachers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    *   Avoid those boasting about their scores or spreading rumors about exam difficulty/pattern changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
    *   One negative thought can lead to an incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

## Subject Management for the Last 9 Days

A recommended [[creating_a_personalized_study_timetable | study timetable]] approach:
1.  **Short Subjects**: Dedicate about 2.5 days to 8 short subjects (e.g., Head & Neck Anatomy, Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensics, Dermatology, ENT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Focus on LRR sessions and Previous Year Questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
2.  **Volatile Subjects ("Giants")**: These include Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Focus on LRR and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. For challenging subjects like Pharmacology and Microbiology, approach them with the mindset of "somehow managing to pass" and not having to study them again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.
3.  **Clinical Subjects**: (e.g., Medicine, Pathology, Physiology): Utilize remaining days for these, focusing on PYQs and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
    *   The aim is to be a "scanning machine" â€“ quickly reviewing everything you've already read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule Structure

Divide your day into four main time slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>:

1.  **Study Pattern**: Theory and MCQs.
2.  **Images**: Dedicated time for image-based questions.
3.  **Sanity Break**: Time for mental well-being.

*   **Sanity Break (30 minutes)**:
    *   Essential for preventing mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
    *   Engage in outdoor activity, a light walk, or anything away from books and phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
    *   Strictly limit this to 30 minutes; do not let it extend to hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   **Images (1 hour)**:
    *   At the end of the day, before sleep, quickly scan through all images related to the subjects studied that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
    *   This helps in faster revision as subjects can be covered in 50-60 minutes just by reviewing images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.
*   **Productive Study Hours**:
    *   Target a minimum of 12-14 *productive* study hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
    *   This means 12 hours of full concentration, with the phone kept aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
    *   If you can achieve your daily targets in 8-9 hours, that's an advantage; don't feel pressured by others' hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Get a minimum of 6 hours of sleep to ensure your brain functions effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Avoid sleepless nights or experimenting with medications to stay awake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

## Study Strategies: Theory and MCQ Practice

*   **Theory vs. MCQ Split**: Dedicate 60% of your study time to MCQs and 40% to theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. When doing MCQs, the explanations also cover theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Daily MCQ Practice**: Aim for at least 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
    *   If currently doing 100, try to increase by 10-15 questions each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**:
    *   Compulsorily complete FMG's last five years of PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
    *   If time permits, do NEET PG's last three years of PYQs (2020, 2021, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
    *   Focus on previous year *topics* rather than memorizing answers to specific questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Questions are no longer copied and pasted directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
    *   If unable to solve papers independently, listen to recall sessions on YouTube at 1.5x or 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

## [[managing_study_stress_and_maintaining_discipline | Anxiety and Stress Management]]

*   **Forgetting is Normal**: It is impossible to memorize all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. If you forget something, quickly revise it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Mindset is Key**: Success in competitive exams in India relies on both knowledge and, more importantly, mindset and mental stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
*   **Block Negative Thoughts**: Do not dwell on hypothetical negative scenarios like alarm not ringing, reaching the center, or computer issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Present**: Break down your study into small, manageable blocks (e.g., "what to study for the next three hours") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. Don't worry about how you will feel after 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

## Exam Day Approach

*   **Expect Variation**: One paper will likely be tough, and the other easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. This is normal and helps balance the overall score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   **Mid-Exam Break**: Do *not* discuss Paper 1 during the break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. Forget it and focus entirely on Paper 2 to avoid carrying over negative feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

## Sustaining Focus

*   **Beyond Pomodoro**: The "Pomodoro technique" (20 mins study, 10 mins break) is no longer suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.
*   **Practice Long Stretches**: Train yourself to sit for 3 to 3.5 hours at a stretch without breaks, phone, or distractions, maintaining alertness and attention, mirroring exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.

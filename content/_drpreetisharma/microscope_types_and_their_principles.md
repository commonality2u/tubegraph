Microscopy is a fundamental technique in microbiology, allowing for the visualization and identification of microorganisms and their structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Different types of [[microscopes_and_their_types | microscopes]] employ distinct principles for illumination and image formation.

## Light Microscope
The light microscope utilizes transmitted light to illuminate a specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[10:06]</a>.
*   **Components** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06">[02:06]</a>:
    *   **Condenser**: This component is located below the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55">[02:55]</a>.
    *   **Stage**: The platform where the specimen is placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51">[02:51]</a>.
    *   **Objective Lens**: These lenses magnify the specimen, commonly found in powers of 4x, 10x, 40x, and 100x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26">[03:26]</a>.
    *   **Eyepiece Lens**: The lens through which the observer views the magnified image, typically offering 10x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09">[03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[03:42]</a>.
*   **Magnification**: Total magnification is calculated by multiplying the eyepiece magnification by the objective lens magnification. For instance, a 10x eyepiece with a 100x objective lens yields a total magnification of 1000x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39">[03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44">[03:44]</a>.

## Fluorescent Microscope
This type of [[microscopes_and_their_types | microscope]] is similar in appearance to a light microscope but incorporates specific features for fluorescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57">[03:57]</a>.
*   **Key Addition**: The presence of dichroic mirrors is a distinguishing feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08">[04:08]</a>.
*   **Light Source**: [[fluorescent_microscopy_and_stains | Fluorescent microscopes]] use ultraviolet (UV) light for illumination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16">[04:16]</a>.
*   **Principle**: They convert short wavelengths of light into longer wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37">[05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44">[05:44]</a>.
*   **Associated Stains**:
    *   **TB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis)**: Auramine-rhodamine stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33">[04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09">[05:09]</a>.
    *   **Malaria**: Acridine orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47">[04:47]</a>.
    *   **Fungus**: Calcofluor White <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>.
    *   **Copper (e.g., Wilson's Disease)**: Rhodanine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19">[05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21">[05:21]</a>.

## Electron Microscope
Characterized by its enclosed, "space rocket" like appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54">[05:54]</a>.
*   **Principle**: It operates under a vacuum and uses electrons, not light, for imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04">[06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09">[06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11">[06:11]</a>. This enclosed design maintains the necessary vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04">[06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13">[06:13]</a>.
*   **Use for Viruses**: Viruses are typically seen using an [[microscopes_and_their_types | electron microscope]] because they cannot be viewed with a normal [[microscopes_and_their_types | microscope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Dark Field Microscope
*   **Specific Application**: Used for the diagnosis of [[syphilis_diagnosis_and_treatment | syphilis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>.
*   **Mnemonic**: "Truck drivers always drive in the dark roads" is used as a mnemonic to remember its association with [[syphilis_diagnosis_and_treatment | syphilis]], often linked to truck driver history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>.

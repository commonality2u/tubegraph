HER2neu, also known as EGFR2 or erbB2, is a significant marker in [[breast_cancer_classification_and_diagnosis | breast cancer diagnosis]] and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Its positivity in patients is primarily due to gene amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This means the gene becomes overactive, leading to increased protein production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Detection Methods

### [[immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification_in_cancer | Immunohistochemistry (IHC)]]
[[immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification_in_cancer | Immunohistochemical staining]] is commonly used to detect HER2neu expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. A positive result on IHC typically presents as a brown color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, which is caused by the stain diaminobenzidine (DAB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
For confirming HER2neu gene amplification, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is the investigation of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

*   **Normal Interpretation**: In a normal female, two red signals are expected, corresponding to the two HER2 genes on each of the two chromosome 17s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Amplified Interpretation**: The presence of multiple red signals indicates that HER2 is amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Interpretation and Clinical Relevance

The scoring of HER2neu on [[immunohistochemistry_and_gene_amplification_in_cancer | immunohistochemistry]] guides further management and testing:

*   **Score 0 or 1+**: Indicates no HER2neu gene amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Score 3+**: Indicates definite HER2neu gene amplification, allowing for treatment with targeted therapies like Trastuzumab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Score 2+**: Represents an equivocal or uncertain situation where it is unclear if HER2neu is amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. In such cases, a FISH analysis is performed to confirm gene amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. A 2+ IHC score is considered the perfect candidate for subsequent FISH analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

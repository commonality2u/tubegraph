## Approaching the Exam Period

The final days leading up to a medical exam can be challenging, often accompanied by heightened anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The primary purpose of review sessions at this stage is not just to impart knowledge, but also to help ease nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Managing Nerves and Stress
Working to calm your nerves is crucial, as this directly impacts your ability to study effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

> [00:02:25] Before you start this session, take a deep breathe in deep breathe out because this is Exactly what will help you survive till your exam.

With admit cards released for the FMGE, palpitations are expected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. It's important to work on calming yourself down first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The current period is not the time to be overconfident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, nor is it a time for unnecessary self-pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Everyone experiences similar levels of anxiety and forgetfulness at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

> [01:07:14] The mindset that works in a compose state, he who gives the exam will clear that which is unnecessary. You will create panic and then whatever you have read will also you will forget it.

### Study Approach in Final Days
In the very last few days before the exam, students are advised to focus on concentrated material rather than long videos or rapid revision sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Reviewing Last-Minute Revision (LRR) sessions (e.g., from November and December) for subjects like Pathology and Microbiology is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For new content covered in short, focused sessions, there's no need to revise it immediately afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

If you find yourself unable to study independently, [[exam_preparation_and_strategy | passive learning]] is considered the best approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This means attending any class or session to absorb knowledge, even if you can't actively study on your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Session Etiquette
When attending review sessions, focus on the material being presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. It's advised to hold miscellaneous doubts (e.g., "Is this for FMGE or NEET?") until the end of the session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Final Countdown Strategy

### Time Management and Daily Routine
> [01:08:56] Make a time table for yourself and save hours of time. Sleep and rest for an hour or so during an outdoor walk. And just relaxation time and rest of the time study.

Maintain a structured [[daily_routine_for_effective_fmge_preparation | daily routine]] and [[time_management_and_study_techniques_for_fmge | time management]] plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>. Ensure you allocate time for sleep, rest, and outdoor walks for relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. The remaining time should be dedicated to study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.

### Exam Day Mindset
On the day of the exam, focus entirely on the question in front of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. Avoid letting your mind wander to unstudied topics or remaining syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. Trust that your mind will automatically recall what you've studied when focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

### Pre-Exam Meetings
Anticipating the high stress levels, regular short online sessions are planned for medical students in the days leading up to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. These sessions are intended to provide support and keep students on track, as [[managing_mental_health_during_exam_preparation | studying independently can be difficult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. A specific session is planned for the day before the exam (e.g., January 19th), which will include tips on [[time_management_and_study_schedule_for_fmge | time management]] during the exam, rather than new content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.

> [01:07:05] Last two three days is what mindset knowledge is, everyone has LRR, everyone has seen the PDF. Everybody has it, everybody has studied too. The mindset that works in a compose state, he who gives the exam will clear that.

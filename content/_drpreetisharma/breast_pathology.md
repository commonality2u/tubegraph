### General Concepts

A [[breast_cancer_and_genetic_alterations | radial scar]] in the breast can exhibit a central stellate scar, similar to findings in the kidney, liver, and pancreas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:07">[03:50:07]</a>.

#### Breast Cancer Molecular Classification
The molecular classification of breast cancer is fundamentally based on gene profiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:08">[05:56:08]</a>. Due to technical and financial constraints, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu is used as a surrogate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

Common molecular subtypes include:
*   **Triple-negative breast cancer:** Negative for ER, PR, and HER2/neu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:22">[05:59:22]</a>.
    *   Examples: Medullary carcinoma of the breast and metaplastic carcinoma of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:12">[06:00:12]</a>.
*   **HER2-rich breast cancer:** Positive for HER2/neu, negative for ER and PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:15">[06:00:15]</a>.
    *   Example: Apocrine carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:25">[06:00:25]</a>.
*   **Luminal A:** ER/PR positive, HER2/neu negative, and low Ki67 (<14%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
    *   Considered a "dustbin" category for other types not fitting other classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:59">[06:02:59]</a>.
    *   Includes tubular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, and low-grade [[breast_cancer_and_genetic_alterations | invasive lobular carcinoma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:07">[06:03:07]</a>.
*   **Luminal B:** ER/PR positive, HER2/neu negative or positive, and high Ki67 (>14%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:03">[06:01:03]</a>.
    *   Can sometimes be triple positive (ER, PR, HER2/neu positive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:56">[06:03:56]</a>.
    *   High-grade [[breast_cancer_and_genetic_alterations | invasive lobular carcinoma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:27">[06:03:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Ki67 (also known as MIB-1) is a proliferation marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:16">[06:11:16]</a>. A Ki67 index nearing 100% is seen in Burkitt's lymphoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:51">[06:01:51]</a>.

#### Breast Cancer Diagnosis
The gold standard for diagnosing any cancer is a biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### Specific Breast Cancers and Features

#### HER2/neu Amplification in Breast Cancer
HER2/neu (also known as HER2 or ERBB2) is a proto-oncogene often amplified in breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:08">[04:20:08]</a>.
*   **Targeted Therapy:** Trastuzumab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:08">[04:33:08]</a>.
*   **Diagnostic Tools:**
    *   **Immunohistochemistry (IHC):** Positive staining appears brown due to diaminobenzidine (DAB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:08">[04:35:08]</a>.
        *   Scoring:
            *   0 and 1+: Negative; Trastuzumab is not indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:08">[04:45:08]</a>.
            *   3+: Positive; Trastuzumab is indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:08">[04:45:08]</a>.
            *   2+: Equivocal; requires further testing with FISH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:08">[04:48:08]</a>.
    *   **FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization):** Used to confirm HER2/neu amplification in 2+ IHC cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:08">[04:57:08]</a>.
        *   A normal FISH result shows a ratio of 1 HER2/neu signal (red) to 1 Chromosome 17 signal (green) per cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:08">[04:45:08]</a>.
        *   Amplification is confirmed if the ratio of HER2/neu signals to Chromosome 17 signals is greater than 2.2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:08">[04:54:08]</a>.

#### Mucinous (Colloid) Carcinoma of the Breast
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Often presents as a soft, jelly-like breast mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:08">[04:42:08]</a>.
*   **Pathological Features:**
    *   Predominantly [[Histopathological Examination | extracellular mucin]] pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:08">[04:48:08]</a>. Tumor cells appear to float within these mucin pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:08">[04:48:08]</a>.
    *   Can sometimes have an intracellular mucin component in addition to the extracellular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
    *   On fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), it shows "chicken wire" blood vessels (entangled vessels resembling chicken wire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:08">[05:39:08]</a>. This is because the abundant mucin makes it difficult for blood vessels to be clearly seen, making them appear "stuck" and wired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:08">[05:39:08]</a>.

#### [[breast_cancer_and_genetic_alterations | Invasive Lobular Carcinoma]] (ILC) of the Breast
*   **Prevalence:** Occurs in older women, typically post-menopause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>.
*   **Clinical Features:** Irregular nodularity of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:02">[05:11:02]</a>. Mammography may show irregular densities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:04">[05:14:04]</a>.
*   **Pathological Features:**
    *   **Indian File Pattern:** Tumor cells arrange in single files, one behind the other, resembling "army men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:02">[05:34:02]</a>.
    *   Can exhibit signet ring cells (cells with abundant intracellular mucin pushing the nucleus to the periphery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>.
*   **Bilaterality and Multicentricity:** ILC has a high propensity for bilaterality and multicentricity (multiple foci within the same breast) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Pathologists often recommend examining the contralateral breast in the report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:20">[05:17:20]</a>.

#### Inflammatory Carcinoma of the Breast
*   **Clinical Features:** Presents with skin changes resembling inflammation, such as dimpling and "peau d'orange" (orange peel appearance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:11">[05:09:11]</a>.
*   **Pathology:** Characterized by dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:16">[05:13:16]</a>.

#### Male Breast Cancer
*   **Prevalence:** Much less common than female breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:02">[05:34:02]</a>.
*   **Genetic Association:** Strongly associated with BRCA2 mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:07">[05:44:07]</a>.
*   **Most Common Type:** [[breast_cancer_and_genetic_alterations | Invasive ductal carcinoma]] (IDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Molecular Classification:** Follows the same molecular classification as female breast cancer (HER2/neu positive, ER negative, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:01">[05:59:01]</a>.

#### Myofibroblastoma of the Breast
*   This is a rare benign tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:03">[06:05:03]</a>.
*   It has an equal incidence in males and females, which is uncommon for breast tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:57">[06:04:57]</a>. This equal incidence is reflected in its name, sometimes abbreviated as "MF tumor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:22">[06:05:22]</a>.

Cardiomyopathies are a group of diseases that affect the heart muscle. Identification often involves characteristic microscopic appearances, gross pathology, and patient history, with causes ranging from idiopathic to genetic or stress-induced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

## Types of Cardiomyopathy

### [[dilated_and_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy | Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)]]
*   **Identification**
    *   **Microscopic Appearance**: Often characterized by a "Ninja Star Nucleus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Causes**
    *   Most common cause is idiopathic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.
    *   If idiopathic is not an option, alcohol is a common cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.
    *   **Genetic Cause**: [[dilated_and_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy | Titan gene mutation]] is a known genetic cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

### Broken Heart Syndrome (Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy)
*   **Identification**: This condition is also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.
*   **Causes**: It occurs due to an elevation of catecholamines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

### [[dilated_and_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy | Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)]]
*   **Identification**
    *   **Patient History**: Frequently associated with sudden death in young athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
    *   **Gross Pathology**: Displays a "Banana Shaped Heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.
    *   **Microscopic Appearance**: Shows "helter skelter cardiac fibers," indicating disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

### Restrictive Cardiomyopathy
*   **Most Common Cause**: Amyloidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Identification in Cardiac Muscle Fibers**: Characterized by the presence of "pink material" outside the myocytes that is Congo red positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. This is similar to the identification of amyloidosis in other organs, such as the kidney, where a "waxy kidney" is seen and stains with Congo red, showing an "Apple Green" birefringence on polarizing microscope or a "salmon pink" color on light microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

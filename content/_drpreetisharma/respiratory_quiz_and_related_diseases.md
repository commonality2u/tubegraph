The "Weekly Wednesday Wisdom" sessions are designed to provide an orientation and revision for various medical topics, including those related to the respiratory system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These sessions are held every Wednesday at 11 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The aim is to help students prepare for exams such as IAI CET, FMG, and NEET PG by covering the syllabus in continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

## Session Structure and Study Strategy
Each session typically involves a pre-session reading of the given chapter, followed by attending the live session, and then a post-session review of the images and discussed topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. For image review, material found at the end of [[microbiology_study_and_quiz_preparation | Rapid Revision]] sections is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The goal is to complete the core syllabus before major exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Key advice for studying:
*   Utilize [[microbiology_study_and_quiz_preparation | Rapid Revision]] videos and attend live sessions, attempting Q-Bank questions for comprehensive preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.
*   Review images and relevant topics for about 30 minutes after each class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>.
*   Study for two to three days before the session to allow for better retention and self-assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>.

## Respiratory System Topics Covered

### Case Study: Pneumonia and Mitral Valve Prolapse
A 37-year-old female admitted for [[infectious_disease_case_studies_and_treatments | pneumonia]] was found to have a mid-systolic click on chest auscultation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>. Her anti-streptolysin O (ASLO) titer was negative, ruling out rheumatic heart disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>. This scenario is characteristic of [[specific_diseases_and_their_presentations_diagnosis_and_treatment | mitral valve prolapse]] (MVP), often an asymptomatic and incidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>.
*   **Other names for MVP**: Floppy valve syndrome, Barlow syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>.
*   **Histopathology**: Characterized by myxomatous degeneration, where the valve becomes jelly-like and loose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>.

### Lung Tumors: Small Cell Carcinoma
A lung tumor positive for chromogranin is indicative of [[specific_diseases_and_their_presentations_diagnosis_and_treatment | small cell carcinoma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**:
    *   Exhibits neuroendocrine differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
    *   Associated with maximal paraneoplastic syndromes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
    *   Has an aggressive course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
    *   It is *not* positive for mucin (mucins are markers for adenocarcinoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   **IHC Markers**: Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, Bombesin, CD56, CD57, NSE (Neuron Specific Enolase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. These markers are common for all neuroendocrine tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Findings**:
    *   **Electron Microscopy**: Presence of neurosecretory granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Light Microscopy**:
        *   Salt and pepper chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
        *   Azzopardi effect (blue blood vessels due to smudged DNA from cancer cells around vessels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. The presence of DNA can be confirmed with a Feulgen stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

### Emphysema and Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
A four-year-old boy with an unknown cause of death showed panacinar emphysema on autopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. This presentation in a child strongly suggests Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
*   **Gene and Chromosome**: The alpha-1 antitrypsin gene is located on chromosome 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
*   **Panacinar Emphysema**: Affects the entire acinus, including the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct, and alveolar sac (RDS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. This leads to generalized enlargement and destruction of airspaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
*   **Liver Involvement**: Can also cause cirrhosis in the liver, with characteristic PAS-positive, diastase-resistant pink droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

### Occupational Lung Diseases
#### Silicosis and Tuberculosis
Silicosis, common in glass and silica industries, significantly increases the risk of [[tuberculosis_diagnosis_and_occupational_diseases | tuberculosis]] and lung cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.
*   **Granulomas**: The presence of Langhans giant cells and a prominent lymphocyticol collar around the granuloma is characteristic of a TB granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. In contrast, sarcoidosis granulomas are "naked" (lacking the lymphocytic collar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis of Sarcoidosis**: A diagnosis of exclusion, requiring elevated calcium, ACE levels, and a CD4/CD8 ratio, in addition to granulomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.
*   **Sarcoidosis Bodies**: Asteroid bodies (star-shaped, intracellular) and Schaumann bodies (round, calcified, similar to psammoma bodies) are seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Asteroid bodies are also seen extracellularly in Sporothrix (Rose Gardener's Disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   **Caseation**: While caseous necrosis is more common in [[tuberculosis_diagnosis_and_occupational_diseases | tuberculosis]], both caseating and non-caseating granulomas can be seen in [[tuberculosis_diagnosis_and_occupational_diseases | tuberculosis]] and sarcoidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

#### Asbestosis and Ferruginous Bodies
Asbestosis is characterized by the presence of asbestos bodies, which appear as brown, dumbbell-shaped structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Formation**: These bodies are formed when the body deposits iron around inhaled asbestos fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Staining**: They stain blue with Prussian blue (Perls' stain) due to the iron content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Nomenclature**: These are also called ferruginous bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. All asbestos bodies are ferruginous bodies (because they contain iron), but not all ferruginous bodies are asbestos bodies (as iron can also deposit around other inhaled particles like silica or coal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Upcoming Sessions
The next session will focus on [[esophageal_disorders_and_diagnoses | GITM Liver]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. The schedule for sessions beyond March 20th will be announced, but the series will continue, covering [[infectious_disease_case_studies_and_treatments | viro]], [[renal_pathology_and_genital_urinary_system_quiz | general path]], and hematology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

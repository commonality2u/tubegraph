Viruses are typically viewed using an electron microscope, which is why their images often appear in black and white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:04">[02:01:04]</a>.

## Specific Viruses and Their Characteristics

*   **Vaccine Side Effects**: Rotavirus vaccines (e.g., Rotarix) can rarely cause intussusception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:05">[02:53:05]</a>.

### Adenovirus
*   **Appearance**: Described as looking like a "space vehicle" carrying an alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:24">[02:29:24]</a>.
*   **Clinical Features**: Adenovirus types 40 and 41 are known to cause diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:41">[02:39:41]</a>.

### Parvovirus B19
*   **Appearance**: Not explicitly mentioned, but described as the smallest virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:59">[03:08:59]</a>.
*   **Clinical Features**:
    *   **Slapped Cheek Appearance**: Causes a distinctive rash on the cheeks, appearing as if slapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:11">[03:07:11]</a>.
    *   **Fifth Disease**: Also known as Fifth Disease, due to the rash appearing on hands and feet in addition to the cheeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:10">[03:17:10]</a>.
    *   **Hematological Effects**: Can cause bone marrow failure, leading to aplastic anemia or aplastic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:10">[03:17:10]</a>.
*   **Genetics**: It is the only single-stranded DNA virus; all other DNA viruses are double-stranded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:59">[03:08:59]</a>.

### Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
*   **Associated Cells**: Causes Downey cells, which have a "ballerina skirt" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:55">[03:19:55]</a>.
*   **Target Cells**: Primarily infects B cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22">[03:22:22]</a>.
*   **Receptor**: Utilizes CD2 and CR2 as receptors for entry into B cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:26">[03:26:26]</a>.

### Molluscum Contagiosum Virus
*   **Clinical Features**: Characterized by umbilicated lesions on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:53">[03:43:53]</a>.
*   **Classification**: It is a type of poxvirus, thus a DNA virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:03">[03:33:03]</a>.
*   **Associated Bodies**: Harson-Peters bodies (HP bodies) are seen within the lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:15">[03:13:15]</a>.
*   **Stain**: Floxarted stain is used for HP bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:53">[03:43:53]</a>.

### Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)
*   **Clinical Features**: HSV type 2 causes painful genital ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:17">[05:13:17]</a>.
*   **Associated Bodies**: Lipe-Schultz bodies are seen with herpes infections (e.g., herpes labialis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Hepatitis B Virus
*   **Markers of Infection**:
    *   **HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen)**: The first marker to elevate, indicating the onset of the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.
    *   **HBeAg (Hepatitis B e-antigen)**: Indicates high infectivity of the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.
    *   **Anti-HBe (Antibody to HBeAg)**: Its presence indicates that infectivity is decreasing, and recovery is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>.
    *   **Anti-HBs (Antibody to HBsAg)**: Indicates immunity, often seen after vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>.
*   **Window Period**: A period where HBsAg is negative, and Anti-HBs has not yet appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis in Window Period**: During the window period, IgM anti-HBc (antibody to core antigen) is the key marker for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:25">[01:39:25]</a>.
*   **Acute vs. Chronic Hepatitis B**:
    *   **Acute Hepatitis B with High Infectivity**: HBsAg (+), HBeAg (+), IgM anti-HBc (+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:09">[01:40:09]</a>.
    *   **Chronic Hepatitis B**: HBsAg (+), HBeAg (-), IgG anti-HBc (+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>. (Note: Transcript says 'sexy' for chronic, which is a mnemonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:02">[01:41:02]</a>).

Ovarian tumors are a significant topic in [[discussion_on_pathology_for_upcoming_exams | pathology]], often appearing in examinations and requiring a comprehensive understanding of their characteristics, including [[histological_and_cytological_appearances_in_pathology | histological and cytological appearances]], genetics, and associated markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

## Categories of Ovarian Tumors

Ovarian tumors are broadly categorized, with surface epithelial tumors being a key group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. A consistent tumor marker for surface epithelial tumors is CA125 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>.

### Serous Cystadenoma

Serous cystadenoma is characterized by:
*   **Gross Appearance:** Typically a single, uniloculated cyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.
*   **Fluid:** Contains clear, watery (serous) fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Appearance:** Exhibits ciliated epithelium and often shows [[histological_and_cytological_appearances_in_pathology | psammoma bodies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>.

### Mucinous Cystadenoma

Mucinous cystadenoma presents with:
*   **Gross Appearance:** Often multiloculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>.
*   **Fluid:** Contains abundant mucin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Appearance:** Characterized by mucin-containing, empty cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

### Brenner Tumor

Brenner tumors are surface epithelial tumors known for:
*   **Epithelium:** Resemble bladder (urinary bladder transitional) epithelium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>.
*   **Nucleus:** Display a characteristic [[granulosa_cell_tumor_characteristics_and_coffee_bean_appearance | coffee bean nucleus]] appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **Associations:** In 25% of cases, Brenner tumors are associated with mucinous tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.
    *   *Note:* Walthard cell rests are normal embryonic derivatives resembling transitional epithelium found in miscellaneous sites like the fallopian tube or ovary, and are not considered a disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.

### Granulosa Cell Tumor

[[granulosa_cell_tumor_characteristics_and_coffee_bean_appearance | Granulosa cell tumors]] are often seen in post-menopausal females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>.
*   **Hormonal Activity:** They are functionally hormonal, leading to hyperestrogenic states and [[histological_and_cytological_appearances_in_pathology | endometrial thickening]] or bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.
*   **Histology:**
    *   **Call-Exner bodies:** Characterized by cells arranged in a rounded pattern around a central pink material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.
    *   **Nuclear Grooves:** Exhibit nuclear grooves, also referred to as a [[granulosa_cell_tumor_characteristics_and_coffee_bean_appearance | coffee bean nucleus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>.
*   **Genetics:** Associated with *FOXL2* gene mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.
*   **Tumor Marker:** Inhibin is a tumor marker for granulosa cell tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.
*   **Immunohistochemistry:** Can be CD99 positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

### Leydig Cell Tumor

*   **Histology:** Reinke's Crystalloids are characteristic of Leydig cell tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.

### Yolk Sac Tumor

*   **Tumor Marker:** Associated with elevated Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

### Dysgerminoma

*   **Tumor Markers:** Associated with elevated LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) and PLAP (Placental Alkaline Phosphatase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.

Immunofluorescence shows a "starry sky" appearance, with granular deposits of green fluorescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

### Microscopic Findings in Kidney Disease
*   **Minimal Change Disease:** On electron microscopy, it shows effacement of foot processes of podocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. This is a nephrotic syndrome common in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.
*   **Membranous Glomerulonephropathy:** Characterized by "spike and dome" appearance on microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>, commonly seen in elderly individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.
*   **Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN) Type 1:** Shows a "tram track" appearance due to double basement membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.
*   [[diabetic_nephropathy_and_pathology | Diabetic Nephropathy]]: Presents with Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions, also known as nodular glomerular sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

## Brain Pathology
[[Brain tumor case study|Brain tumors]] and neurodegenerative conditions have distinct pathological features.

### Brain Tumors
*   **Pilocytic Astrocytoma:** Grossly appears cystic, especially in a child's cerebrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. Microscopically, it shows characteristic Rosenthal fibers (pink fibers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. It is a grade 1 tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.
*   **Glioblastoma (GBM):** Appears as a "butterfly" glioma on imaging and shows "serpentine necrosis" (snake-like necrosis) microscopically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. Tumors with "blastoma" in their name (e.g., medulloblastoma, glioblastoma) are typically Grade IV, indicating a very poor prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
*   **Oligodendroglioma:** Classically presents with a "fried egg" appearance of the cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
*   **Meningioma:** A common tumor seen in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. Microscopically, it often contains psammoma bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a> and on imaging, it shows a "dural tail sign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
*   **Homer Wright Pseudo-rosettes:** These rosettes are filled with pink material and are characteristic of medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, and Ewing's sarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Flexner-Wintersteiner True Rosettes:** These rosettes are empty in the center and are seen in retinoblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Schwannoma:** This tumor of the nerves is characterized by Verocay bodies, which are palisading nuclei. Microscopically, it shows Antoni A areas (hypercellular with many cells) and Antoni B areas (hypocellular/blank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. Schwannoma is most commonly associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), also known as bilateral acoustic schwannoma, involving cranial nerve 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. The gene involved is on chromosome 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.

### Neurodegenerative Diseases
*   **Alzheimer's Disease:** Associated with Tau protein, which forms neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Hirano bodies, composed of actin, are also seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.
*   **Parkinson's Disease:** Characterized by Lewy bodies, which are made up of alpha-synuclein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
*   **Negri Bodies:** Seen in rabies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.

### Other Important Considerations
*   [[Pathology Image Identification | Visual and histological pathology clues for diagnosis]] are critical for accurate diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   The discussion references [[Pathology image analysis | pathology image analysis]] and [[Brain tumor imaging and identifying patterns | brain tumor imaging and identifying patterns]] as complementary to histological findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   [[Diabetic nephropathy pathology and special stains | Special stains]] like Congo Red for amyloidosis are crucial for confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

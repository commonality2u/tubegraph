[[Diabetic nephropathy]] is a common complication of uncontrolled diabetes, characterized by specific renal changes affecting the glomeruli and tubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A 55-year-old female presented for a regular health checkup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Her complete blood count (CBC) showed normal hemoglobin (12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, normal total leukocyte count (10,000, within 4,000-11,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, normal differential count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, and normal platelet counts (170,000, within 1.5-4.5 lakhs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Diagnostic Findings
### Laboratory Findings
The key abnormal finding was an elevated HbA1c of 11%, indicating uncontrolled diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Urine analysis revealed 2+ protein and 3+ glucose, but no casts or crystals were noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Pathology and Histology
A renal biopsy is performed to confirm the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

#### Kimmelstiel-Wilson (KW) Lesion
The most characteristic lesion in [[diabetic_nephropathy_and_its_mnemonic_aid | diabetic nephropathy]] is the Kimmelstiel-Wilson (KW) lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, also known as Nodular Glomerulosclerosis (NGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This lesion is characterized by pinkish nodules of sclerosis within the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

#### Special Stain: PAS
To better appreciate the nodules, a special stain called PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) stain is used, which highlights the pink color of the nodules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The PAS stain is the special stain of choice for identifying KW lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

#### Other Findings in Diabetic Nephropathy
A mnemonic, "The Diabetic Nephropathy," helps recall other key pathological findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>:
*   **T**hickening of the capillary basement membrane in the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **H**yaline arteriolosclerosis affecting the glomerular capillaries and arterioles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **E**pstein-Armani lesion: This is a non-glomerular finding, characterized by glycogen accumulation in the proximal convoluted tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It is important as it is *not* a glomerular finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **D**iffuse glomerulosclerosis: The entire glomerulus becomes pink due to widespread sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **N**odular glomerulosclerosis (KW lesion): Pink, nodular sclerosis within the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **D**rop: Capsular drop, where pinkish material drops from Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **N**eck: Papillary necrosis, involving the renal papilla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Diabetes is a common cause of papillary necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Other causes can be remembered by the mnemonic "DOSA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **C**ap: Fibrin cap, characterized by pinkish material sitting on the capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Sample Collection for Diagnosis
*   **CBC Sample:** Collected in a purple vacutainer containing EDTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Sample:** Also collected in a purple vacutainer with EDTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   *Note:* Other glucose samples (fasting blood sugar, postprandial blood sugar, random blood sugar) are collected in a gray vacutainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

[[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | Human Papillomavirus]] (HPV) is a significant factor in the development of certain cancers, particularly those affecting the cervix. The virus causes changes in cells that can be observed microscopically, and its specific proteins play a crucial role in disrupting normal cell regulation, leading to malignant transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

## Coilocytes: A Histopathological Hallmark

A key indicator of [[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | HPV]] infection seen in a Pap smear is the presence of a coilocyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. A coilocyte is characterized by:
*   A shriveled or "raisinoid" nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   A distinct perinuclear halo (whitening around the nucleus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

These features, when observed together, are indicative of an [[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | HPV]] infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. The E4 and E5 proteins of the [[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | HPV]] are responsible for the formation of the coilocyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

## [[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | HPV]] Types and Associated Conditions

[[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | HPV]] is categorized into two main types based on their risk for cancer development:

*   **Low-risk HPVs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
    *   Include types 6 and 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
    *   Primarily cause warts, also known as condyloma acuminatum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **High-risk HPVs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>
    *   Include types 16 and 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
    *   Are the most common causes of squamous cell carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, particularly in cervical cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Mechanism of Cancer Development

[[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | HPV]] is a DNA virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The mechanism by which high-risk [[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | HPV]] causes cancer involves the inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This process is mediated by specific viral proteins:

*   **E6 protein** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>: The E6 protein targets and inactivates the p53 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, often referred to as the "policeman" gene due to its role in cell cycle control and apoptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   **E7 protein** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>: The E7 protein targets and inactivates the RB (retinoblastoma) gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, known as the "governor" gene, which regulates cell growth and division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

Both p53 and RB are critical tumor suppressor genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. By inactivating these genes, [[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | HPV]] disrupts the cell's natural mechanisms for preventing uncontrolled growth, thereby facilitating cancer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

## Vaccine Development

The L1 capsid protein of the [[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | HPV]] is utilized in the preparation of [[human_papillomavirus_and_cancer | HPV]] vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

[[Microbiological and histological examination techniques | Microscopy]] is a fundamental tool in the field of microbiology, enabling the visualization and study of microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>. This section details various types of microscopes and their specific applications.

## Historical Foundations

The usual [[light_and_fluorescent_microscopy_in_microbiology | light microscope]] was pioneered by [[Historical aspects and key scientists in microbiology | Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], who is regarded as the father of [[Microscopy in medical education | microscopy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Light Microscope

A [[light_and_fluorescent_microscopy_in_microbiology | light microscope]] is a commonly used instrument in microbiology and pathology labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.

### Components and Function

*   **Light Source**: Utilizes transmitted light, originating from a bulb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>, which passes through the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.
*   **Condenser**: A small structure containing an iris that regulates the amount of light focusing onto the specimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.
*   **Stage**: The platform where the glass slide containing the specimen is placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>, usually made of glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Adjustment Knobs**:
    *   **Coarse Adjustment**: The larger knob for significant vertical movement of the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>.
    *   **Fine Adjustment**: The smaller knob for precise focusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.
*   **Eyepiece Lens**: Where the observer looks, typically providing a 10x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.
*   **Objective Lenses**: A set of lenses positioned close to the specimen, offering various magnifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>:
    *   **Scanner Lens**: 4x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.
    *   **Low Power Lens**: 10x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.
    *   **High Power Lens**: 40x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>.
    *   **Oil Immersion Lens**: 100x magnification, used with oil for enhanced resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>.

### Magnification Calculation

The total magnification is calculated by multiplying the eyepiece magnification by the objective lens magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>.

*   Scanner: 10x (eyepiece) * 4x (objective) = 40x total magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>.
*   Low Power: 10x * 10x = 100x total magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.
*   High Power: 10x * 40x = 400x total magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.
*   Oil Immersion: 10x * 100x = 1000x total magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>.

The maximum magnification achievable with a light microscope is 1000x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

### Specimen Fixative

For [[Medical imaging in pathology and microbiology | medical imaging in pathology and microbiology | light microscopy]], tissue samples are typically fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:53">[02:55:53]</a>.

## Dark Field Microscope

This microscope produces a dark background with brightly illuminated specimens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>.

*   **Light Source**: Uses reflected light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.
*   **Uses**: Ideal for visualizing very thin organisms or structures, such as spirochetes (e.g., *Treponema pallidum*) and bacterial flagella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>.

## Fluorescent Microscope

The [[light_and_fluorescent_microscopy_in_microbiology | fluorescent microscope]] is characterized by its use of fluorescent dyes.

*   **Light Source**: Utilizes ultraviolet (UV) light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: When UV light contacts a fluorescent dye, the shorter wavelength of the UV light changes into a longer wavelength, producing a visible fluorescent color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:32">[02:22:32]</a>.
*   **Fluorescent Dyes and Uses**:
    *   **Auramine and Rhodamine**: Used for suspected cases of tuberculosis (TB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:47">[02:21:47]</a>.
    *   **Acridine Orange**: Used for detecting malaria parasites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>.
    *   **Calcofluor White**: Used for identifying fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>.

## Electron Microscope (EM)

Discovered by [[Historical aspects and key scientists in microbiology | Ernst Ruska]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, the electron microscope provides much higher magnification and resolution than light microscopes.

*   **Appearance**: Often described as resembling a closed "spaceship" or "space shuttle" due to its vacuum-sealed environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:38">[02:37:38]</a>.
*   **Light Source**: Employs a beam of electrons instead of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>.
*   **Environment**: Requires a vacuum to operate because electrons must be kept in a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:17">[02:41:17]</a>.
*   **Slide Type**: Uses metal slides, typically made of copper, as electrons cannot be used with glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Specimen Fixative**: For [[Medical imaging in pathology and microbiology | medical imaging in pathology and microbiology | electron microscopy]], tissue samples are fixed in 2-2.5% glutaraldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:28">[02:56:28]</a>.

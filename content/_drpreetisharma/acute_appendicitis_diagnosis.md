Acute appendicitis is a condition often diagnosed based on histological features following an appendectomy. It is crucial to distinguish true appendicitis from inflammation in the surrounding tissues.

## Histological Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis

For a definitive diagnosis of acute appendicitis, pathologists look for specific histological criteria:
*   **Neutrophilic Infiltrate**: Neutrophils, which are characteristic cells of acute inflammation, must be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.
*   **Location of Neutrophils**: The neutrophils must be seen specifically in the muscularis propria, also known as the muscle layer of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

If inflammatory cells are present in the muscle layer, it confirms acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

### Distinguishing from Periappendicitis

Inflammation observed in the serosa (the outermost layer of the appendix) indicates [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | peri-appendicitis]], not acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | Periappendicitis]] signifies that inflammation from a surrounding organ has extended onto the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

One common cause of [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | periappendicitis]] in females is [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | salpingitis]], an inflammation of the fallopian tube, which can extend to the serosa of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

> [!example|Example Case]
> A 17-year-old girl presented with crampy right lower quadrant abdominal pain and an enlarged appendix, leading to an appendectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. Histological examination revealed a dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate specifically in the serosa of the appendix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Given the location of the inflammation, the likely diagnosis is [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | acute salpingitis]] causing [[periappendicitis_and_salpingitis | periappendicitis]], rather than acute appendicitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. In cases of perforated appendix, a proper muscle layer would typically not be discernible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

## Incidental Findings in the Appendix

Sometimes, an appendectomy reveals incidental findings, such as parasitic infections, which can occasionally be responsible for appendicitis, but more often are found incidentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Enterobius Vermicularis (Pinworm)

*   ***Enterobius vermicularis*** (also known as the pinworm) is a common incidental finding in the lumen of the appendix during histopathological examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Histological Identification**: The key feature for identifying *Enterobius vermicularis* is the presence of two lateral cuticular alae, which are pointed projections visible on the worm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
    *   The [[histology_of_the_appendix | appendix histology]] itself can be observed, including the lining and goblet cells, as well as dense lymphoid aggregates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Classically, *Enterobius* infection presents with perianal itching or pruritus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Eggs**: The eggs of *Enterobius vermicularis* are classically described as plano-convex, containing a tadpole larva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Diagnostic Method**: The cellophane cellulose tape method (or tape preparation) is employed to collect *Enterobius* eggs for microscopic examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
    *   The eggs can be visualized under different conditions, such as ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a> or with a Pap stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

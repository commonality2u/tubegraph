This 60-day study timetable and strategy is designed for students preparing for the December 2024 FMG exam, applicable to both first-time test-takers and those aiming to improve their previous scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The plan aims to be concise and directly address student concerns regarding their study schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Overview of the 60-Day Plan

The timetable covers the period from July 24th to September 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It is intended to build a strong foundation before transitioning into a dedicated revision phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Key Components

*   **Duration**: 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Focus**: A combination of theory and MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **MCQ Practice**: Target 100-120 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If new to practicing MCQs, gradually increase your daily count by 15-20 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Daily Study Hours**: Maintain an average of 8 to 10 hours per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This consistent effort is crucial for syllabus completion and effective revision later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Study Material Source**: Use a single source per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   For stronger subjects (scoring above 80% in Q-banks), refer to rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   For weaker subjects or topics (scoring below 80%), use main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   Specifically, for Pathology and Microbiology, only rapid revision videos are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Post-60-Day Plan

After the initial 60 days, a [[time_management_and_study_scheduling | revision plan]] will be provided, divided into three phases:
*   Revision 1: 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Revision 2: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Revision 3: 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
This typically extends till around December 15th, with adjustments possible once the exact exam date is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Subject-Wise Breakdown: The 58-Day Study Plan

The subjects are divided into four blocks to facilitate integration and efficient study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

> [!tip] Mindset for the 60 Days
> "No past guilt, no future anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Focus entirely on the present 60-day plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Daily Study Schedule: Time Boxing

This section details a typical day, structuring study and break times to optimize productivity and prevent burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This provides an example of how to implement [[time_management_and_daily_study_schedule | time management and daily study schedule]] for effective studying.

*   **Morning Routine (1 hour)**: Enjoy personal time and incorporate outdoor activity like a 20-minute walk for fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Study Session 1 (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)**: 3 hours of focused study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This longer session builds endurance for exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Break 1 (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM)**: 30 minutes of relaxation, away from screens and social media. This is a mental break, not a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Study Session 2 (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM)**: 2.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. By lunchtime, you've completed 5.5 hours of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Mega Break (2:00 PM - 3:30 PM)**: 1.5 hours for lunch, power nap, and allowed social media or personal entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Study Session 3 (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM)**: Another 2.5-hour study session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Break 2 (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)**: 1 hour for mixed activities, including 20 minutes outdoors and time for discussions or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Study Session 4 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM)**: 2 hours, the final study session of the day, with decreasing intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Evening Routine (9:00 PM onwards)**:
    *   **Custom Module MCQs**: Dedicate about 30 minutes to a casual "JY JY" (just for fun) test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Create a custom module of 30 mixed questions from subjects already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The goal is to stay in touch with past subjects without serious review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
    *   **Chill Time**: Relax, use social media, or watch a web series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
    *   **Sleep**: Aim to sleep by 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM, ensuring 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

This schedule allows for a 10-hour study day with adequate breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. The suggested timings can be adjusted for early birds or night owls while maintaining the overall structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

> Difficult times, like preparing for exams, are temporary and will eventually lead to better days. Embrace the journey with humility, as tough times can foster growth and clinical skills essential for a medical career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

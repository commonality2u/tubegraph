This article summarizes key [[Basic Pathology and Microbiology Concepts | pathology and microbiology concepts]] discussed on Day 3 of the "10 on 10" series, covering clinical MCQs and image identification relevant for NEPG 2025.

## Day 3 Overview
The session focuses on five clinical multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and five image-based questions from pathology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Clinical MCQs

### Spherocytes and Anemia Investigation
The discussion begins with a case of spherocytes on a peripheral smear.

- **Case 1: Primary Gravida**
    - A 27-year-old primigravida presents with spherocytes on her blood film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Spherocytes are characterized by their entirely spherical shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
    - **Most Common Cause**: The most common cause of spherocytes is [[Diagnostics in pathology and microbiology | autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] (AIHA), not hereditary spherocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
    - **Investigation**: For AIHA, a Coombs test is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

- **Case 2: Hereditary Spherocytosis**
    - A 16-year-old boy presents with jaundice and splenomegaly, along with a classical family history of similar complaints in his elder brother and mother, indicating autosomal dominant inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This presentation is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    - **Testing for HS**:
        - **Screening**: In earlier days, osmotic fragility testing was used as a screening test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
        - **Confirmation**: The confirmatory test for HS is the EMA test (Eosin-5-maleimide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    - **Most Common Mutation**: The most common mutation for autosomal dominant hereditary spherocytosis is in the ankyrin gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

- **Alternative Diagnosis: G6PD Deficiency Anemia**
    - If AIHA or HS are ruled out, [[Diagnostics in pathology and microbiology | G6PD deficiency anemia]] should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    - **Testing**: G6PD levels in the blood are measured using an ELISA machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

*Corynebacterium diphtheriae* is a bacterium responsible for the disease diphtheria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. It is also known as Loffler's bacillus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>.

## Characteristics
*C. diphtheriae* is a Gram-positive bacillus, which is an exception to the general rule that most bacilli are Gram-negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. It exhibits no motility, no spore-forming ability, and no capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

### Other *Corynebacterium* Species (Non-Diphtheroids)
*   ***Corynebacterium ulcerans***: Causes ulcerance and can be associated with lung involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.
*   ***Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis***: Also known as the Presnocard bacillus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. It causes infection in animals, particularly sheep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>.
*   ***Corynebacterium minutissimum***: Causes erythrasma, characterized by a coral red rash on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations of Diphtheria
Diphtheria can manifest in various ways, primarily affecting the respiratory tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.
*   **Pseudo membrane formation**: A characteristic feature, often seen in the soft palate and tonsillar area, which is the most common location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>. This membrane remains superficial; deep invasion is not seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:49">[01:32:49]</a>.
*   **Laryngeal involvement**: The most dangerous manifestation, as membrane formation in the larynx can lead to respiratory obstruction, which is life-threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.
*   **Bull's Neck**: Severe swelling and edema of the lymph nodes and neck area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>.

## Toxin and Toxigenicity
Not all *C. diphtheriae* strains are toxigenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. The ability to produce diphtheria toxin is dependent on the presence of the *tox* gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>.
*   **Transduction**: The *tox* gene can be transferred from one *C. diphtheriae* bacterium to another via a bacteriophage, a process known as transduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>.
*   **Mechanism of Action**: The diphtheria toxin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis within host cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:14">[01:30:14]</a>.

## Diagnostic Tests
### Microscopy
*   **Chinese Letter/Cuneiform Appearance**: Under the microscope, *C. diphtheriae* is famous for its arrangement resembling Chinese letters or a cuneiform pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>.
*   **Volutin Granules**: The bacteria exhibit prominent terminal knobs or circles at their poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:25">[01:21:25]</a>. These are also known by several names:
    *   Volutin granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>
    *   Bipolar granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>
    *   Babes-Ernst granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>
    *   Metachromatic granules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:58">[01:21:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>
    These granules are made up of polymetaphosphate, an energy source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:54">[01:24:54]</a>.
    *   **Stains**: Volutin granules can be stained using various methods:
        *   Ponder's stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>
        *   Albert stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>
        *   Neisser's stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>
        Albert stain uses a "Tim-Tim" protocol: Toluene blue (makes granules purple), Iodine, and Malachite green (makes bacteria green) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>.
    *   **Other organisms with Volutin Granules**: While characteristic of *C. diphtheriae*, volutin granules can also be seen in Yeast, [[mycobacterium_tuberculosis | Mycobacterium tuberculosis]], *Gardnerella*, and *Spirillum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>.

### Culture Media
*   **Enriched Media**:
    *   **Loffler's Serum Slope (LSS)**: An enriched medium, meaning it contains many nutrients for rapid bacterial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>. It allows for the fastest growth, with bacteria visible in 6 to 8 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>.
*   **Selective Media**:
    *   **Potassium Tellurite Agar (PTA)**: A selective medium that suppresses the growth of other bacteria, allowing *C. diphtheriae* to shine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>. It takes longer to grow, about 48 hours, and produces a blackish color on the agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>.

### Toxigenicity Testing
*   **Elek Gel Precipitation Test**: Used to determine if a *C. diphtheriae* strain is toxigenic (produces toxin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. This test involves placing filter paper soaked with antitoxin perpendicular to streaks of unknown and known toxigenic/non-toxigenic strains on an agar plate. Precipitation lines indicate the presence of toxin (toxigenic strain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>.

### Susceptibility Testing
*   **Schick Test**: A type of Type 3 hypersensitivity reaction performed on humans to assess their susceptibility or immunity to diphtheria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. A positive Schick test indicates that the person is susceptible to diphtheria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>.

*   **Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome**: *Neisseria meningitidis* is famous for causing bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, also known as Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. (Note: While mentioned in the context of [[neisseria_differences_and_pathogenicity | Neisseria]], it's a severe condition that can be confused with other systemic bacterial infections.)

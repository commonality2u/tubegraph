This session focuses specifically on FMG students preparing for the January 20th exam, with approximately 10 days remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26"></a>. This period is crucial, considered "make or break" for all the efforts put into studying, Q-banks, and previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08"></a>.

## General Approach & Mindset

### Do's and Don'ts
*   **Positivity is Key** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17"></a>: Surround yourself with people who provide positive vibes, such as parents, siblings, or good friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29"></a>. Avoid those who spread rumors, claim unrealistic scores, or give illogical advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37"></a>.
*   **Ignore Rumors and Negative Thoughts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01"></a>: Do not let negative thought processes enter your mind, as one wasted day can equate to losing two or three subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19"></a>. Each negative thought is like an incorrect MCQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39"></a>.
*   **Maintain Mental Stability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31"></a>: Avoid unnecessary worries about exam day logistics, such as alarms or computer functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55"></a>.
*   **Survival Mode** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34"></a>: In the last few days, your mindset should shift to survival. Don't worry if studying feels boring; the goal is to pass the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38"></a>.
*   **No New Experiments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37"></a>: Stick to your established routine and avoid trying new medications or habits before the exam, as you don't know their side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44"></a>.

## Subject Management Strategy

### Addressing Unfinished Subjects
*   **Don't Leave Any Subject** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32"></a>: While no one finishes all 19 subjects entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46"></a>, you must know at least a little bit about every subject. The goal is to answer at least 50% of questions from any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16"></a>.
*   **No "New" Topics in Studied Subjects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21"></a>: Avoid delving into rare topics for subjects you've already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25"></a>.
*   **Strategy for Leftover Subjects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42"></a>:
    *   **LRR Sessions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58"></a>: Utilize Last-Minute Rapid Revision (LRR) sessions.
    *   **Crash Courses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01"></a>: Refer to crash courses from any platform or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03"></a>.
    *   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58"></a>: Focus on PYQs and their associated topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38"></a>.

### Prioritizing Subjects in the Last 9 Days
The speaker suggests dividing subjects into three phases:
1.  **Short Subjects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57"></a>:
    *   Psychiatry, Radiology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Forensic Medicine, Skin, ENT, Ophthalmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00"></a>.
    *   Allocate roughly 2.5 days for these eight subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43"></a>.
    *   Method: Use rapid revision notes (if you're a fast reader) or YouTube LRR sessions combined with all PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21"></a>.
2.  **Giant/Volatile Subjects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04"></a>:
    *   Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12"></a>.
    *   These are often difficult to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49"></a>.
    *   Method: Focus on LRR sessions and previous year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59"></a>. For subjects like Pharmacology and Microbiology, approach them with the mindset that you only need to manage to pass the exam and never study them again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22"></a>. If you can't do the whole subject, at least do the LRR and PYQs to solve 7-8 questions out of 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44"></a>.
3.  **Clinical Subjects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17"></a>:
    *   Pathology, Physiology, Medicine, Surgery, OBGYN, etc.
    *   Method: Concentrate on previous year topics and LRR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31"></a>.

## Daily Study Routine

### Time Allocation
Divide your day into four main slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44"></a>:
1.  **Study (Theory & MCQs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55"></a>:
    *   **Productive Hours** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01"></a>: Aim for a minimum of 12-14 productive study hours daily, not just sitting for that long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31"></a>. If you can complete your targets in 8 hours, that's fine; don't compare yourself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36"></a>.
    *   **Theory vs. MCQ Ratio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10"></a>: Dedicate 40% of your study time to theory and 60% to MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10"></a>. When doing MCQs, read the explanations, which will reinforce theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23"></a>.
2.  **Images** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07"></a>:
    *   Allocate one hour daily for image-based revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03"></a>.
    *   Quickly scan through images from the subjects you studied that day before sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21"></a>.
    *   A session covering top 50 images of Path and Micro will be made available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51"></a>.
3.  **Sanity Break** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10"></a>:
    *   Dedicate 30 minutes daily to an activity away from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35"></a>.
    *   Ideally, engage in outdoor activity like a light walk, or simply step away from your study area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21"></a>. Avoid converting this into a longer break, especially on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58"></a>.
4.  **Sleep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14"></a>:
    *   Ensure a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep for your brain to function effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14"></a>. Do not compromise on sleep, as it can lead to going blank during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27"></a>.

### MCQ Practice
*   **Daily Target** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48"></a>: Aim to solve a minimum of 150+ MCQs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12"></a>. Gradually increase this by 10-15 questions each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55"></a>.
*   **Focus on Topics, Not Just Questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29"></a>: Don't just memorize answers to PYQs, as questions are no longer copied verbatim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25"></a>. Focus on understanding the previous year *topics* and solve related new questions from Q-banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31"></a>.
*   **Reviewing MCQs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09"></a>:
    *   If an MCQ is correct, do not read the explanation, as you already understand it from your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18"></a>.
    *   If an MCQ is incorrect, superficially read the explanation to determine if it was a silly mistake or a knowledge gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29"></a>. If it's a knowledge gap, quickly review 5-10 lines on that topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41"></a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs) and Previous Year Questions (PYQs)

### Approach to Grand Tests
*   **Personal Choice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39"></a>: Giving a GT in the last 9 days is a personal decision. If you score well, it can boost confidence, but a low score can lead to panic and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25"></a>.
*   **Focus on Time Management** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51"></a>: If you take a GT, prioritize [[time_management_and_study_hours_for_exams | time management]] (completing 300 questions within the given time) and identifying [[exam_strategies_for_solving_multiplechoice_questions | silly mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46"></a>. Do not focus on the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36"></a>.
*   **"Bouncer" Questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03"></a>: Expect 20-30 "new" or "bouncer" questions in any GT or exam; these are not what determine your pass or fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03"></a>. Your pass/fail depends on topics you know and silly mistakes you avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29"></a>.
*   **Analyze GT Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53"></a>: If stuck at 130-150 in GTs, quickly analyze where mistakes are occurring. If it's silly mistakes, practice more MCQs; if it's knowledge gaps, review LRR notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58"></a>.

### PYQ Strategy
*   **FMG PYQs are Mandatory** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18"></a>: Complete five years of FMG previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21"></a>.
*   **NEET PG PYQs (Optional)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28"></a>: If time permits after FMG PYQs, do the last three years of NEET PG questions (recall sessions are available) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30"></a>.
*   **INI CET (Optional)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11"></a>: If there's still time, consider the single INI CET paper from November, but it's not crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17"></a>.
*   **Flashback Sessions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:56"></a>: If you're struggling to study from books or apps, utilize YouTube "flashback" sessions that cover all PYQs of 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05"></a>. These can be listened to at 1.5x or 2x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06"></a>.

## Exam Day Specifics

*   **Normalize Sleep Cycle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52"></a>: Start adjusting your sleep cycle to be alert during morning exam hours (9 AM, 10 AM, 11 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55"></a>.
*   **Managing Exam Papers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10"></a>: Expect one paper to be difficult and one to be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10"></a>. If Paper 1 is tough, immediately disconnect from it during the break and focus on Paper 2 without carrying over any backlog or hangover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24"></a>. Your overall passing score of 150 will be a combination of both papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27"></a>.
*   **Sustained Focus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05"></a>: The Pomodoro technique (20 min study, 10 min break) is not suitable now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05"></a>. Practice sitting for 3-3.5 hours straight without distractions, just like in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:29"></a>.

## Additional Resources

*   **Daily Path & Micro Topics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:25"></a>: The speaker will provide "Topic of the Day" (ToTD) for Path and Micro, focusing on 2-3 important topics that take about 30 minutes to revise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31"></a>.
*   **Social Media Questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42"></a>: Five questions are posted daily on social media (likely Instagram) to help with quick revision during breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:55"></a>.

From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

The speaker aims to provide a timetable and strategy to help students prepare effectively for the upcoming FMGE December examination, especially for those who may have been demotivated by previous results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Current Situation and Mindset
Students are advised that while they may feel anxious or demotivated after the July exam results, the December 2023 exam offers another opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It's crucial to find a "tiny little element of good" and a "ray of hope" to stay positive and continue striving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Students have approximately three months to prepare for the December exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The goal is to finish the syllabus, notes, and videos, and complete `MCQs` within this period, aiming for at least 2-3 revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Study Approach and Resources

### Video Lectures vs. Rapid Revision
For efficient [[fmge_preparation_strategy | preparation]], it's generally not feasible to go through full main videos for all 19 subjects in 3 months and still achieve multiple revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The recommended approach is to use `rapid_revision` notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

If a concept is not understood from `rapid_revision` (e.g., cardiomyopathy), then selectively refer to the main video for that specific topic and then return to `rapid_revision` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

**Exceptions for Main Videos:**
*   **OBG (Obstetrics and Gynaecology) and PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine):** These subjects have a high weightage, often contributing 40+ questions each in the FMGE exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Therefore, it's advisable to consider doing their main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects (Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Microbiology):** For these subjects, it's better to read `rapid_revision` notes repeatedly and focus on high accuracy, rather than going through extensive main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The `rapid_revision` for Pathology and Microbiology is considered 100% sufficient for FMGE and NEET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

### Question Practice (MCQs)
*   `MCQs` must be done side-by-side with theory for each topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Source of Questions:**
    *   For textbook-wise questions, "FMGE Solutions" is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   For app-based questions, `Prepladder`'s question bank is suggested, especially its clinical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs):** PYQs from FMGE Solutions are important for identifying frequently asked topics, even if they are often one-liners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. However, current exams feature lengthy, clinical questions that require practice beyond just PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Clinical Question Bank:** Practice from a clinical question bank (like `Prepladder`'s) is crucial for improving problem-solving skills for longer, more complex questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This also helps with [[time_management_techniques_for_fmge | time management]] and identifying "buzzwords" in lengthy scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.
*   **Number of Questions:** Start with around 50 questions per day and gradually increase to 100-150 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

## Daily Study Hours
Students who failed the July exam should aim for 12-14 hours of dedicated study daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This rigorous effort is necessary to clear the December attempt and avoid the June 2024 session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. It's about utilizing time effectively within those hours, not necessarily giving up all social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Timetable Structure: The 46-Day Plan

A 46-day plan is provided to finish the initial syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### Baseline Assessment
*   On the day the session was held (Sept 2nd), students were advised to take a Grand Test (GT) to establish a baseline score, regardless of the score achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   This baseline is part of creating a "75-hard challenge" mindset for sustained effort and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Grand Test (GT) Improvement Strategy
*   Improve GT scores gradually. Don't aim for a massive jump overnight; instead, target small increments, e.g., an increase of 10 marks per GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   Identify weak subjects in GTs (e.g., OBG, Pathology, PSM) and dedicate focused revision time to them to improve scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   Avoid unnecessary mental pressure; gradual progress is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Subject Allocation in 46-Day Plan
The plan allows for flexibility in subject order. Students can prioritize subjects they felt weak in during the July exam (e.g., OBG, Pathology, PSM) or those they generally find difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

*   **Daily Medicine Study:** Instead of tackling Medicine as one large block, dedicate 1 hour to it daily as a ritual. This helps with integration and makes the vast subject less daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
*   **Volatile Subjects:** Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Microbiology are highlighted as volatile subjects that many students fear. The advice is to focus on `rapid_revision` for these and revisit them repeatedly for retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

### Managing Backlogs and Timetable Creation
*   It is normal for backlogs to occur daily; aiming to finish 80-85% of the daily targets is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. No one can finish 100% of a timetable every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   Students can create their own [[daily_study_schedule_for_fmge | daily study schedule]] and [[daily_study_schedule_and_time_management | time management]] plans based on the suggested number of days per subject, adjusting according to their strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   For those attending offline coaching, follow the coaching's timetable but ensure daily revision is done to prevent backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

## Revision Strategy
Once the 46-day syllabus is completed, the focus shifts entirely to revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

*   **Notes-Centric Revision:** Revision should primarily be done from notes, not videos. Videos should only be opened for clarifying forgotten concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. Notes should be constantly reviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   **Selective Bookmarking:** When doing `MCQs`, bookmark only questions that are genuinely important or frequently forgotten (e.g., specific facts in Biochemistry or Microbiology that are hard to retain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. Avoid bookmarking too many questions, as this hinders effective revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Active Recall:** Engage in active recall by asking yourself questions, covering answers in notes, or quizzing each other if studying with a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This method helps solidify knowledge and builds confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. The speaker plans to introduce a "fill in the blank" style active recall session on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.

## General Advice
*   **Don't Change Sources:** If students have already been studying from a particular platform or set of notes (e.g., Unacademy), they should stick to it and not change sources at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. Slight additions with each exam update are normal and don't necessitate a complete source change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Exam Trauma:** The difficulty of the July exam and unexpected changes (clinical, lengthy questions) caused "trauma" for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>. This time, the exam is unlikely to be tougher, so students should focus on repeated revisions and solving more questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.
*   **Personal Purpose and Target Score:** Write down a desired target score (e.g., 151+) and a personal purpose for studying (e.g., for family, for dreams, for licensing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. This serves as a daily motivation and reminder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.
*   **Maintain Positivity:** Remember that "it's not over until you win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Approach studies with a positive mindset and a smile, as past failures are just stepping stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>. Don't stress over unpredictable aspects of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.

The Camp test is a specific laboratory assay used in [[Microbial identification and staining techniques | microbial identification]] and [[Bacterial identification through culture characteristics | bacterial identification]] to detect certain microbial interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. It is named after the scientists Christy, Atkins, and Munch-Peterson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

## Camp Test (Christie-Atkins-Munch-Peterson Test)

This test is primarily used for the diagnosis of *Streptococcus agalactiae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:59">[01:44:59]</a>.

### Procedure and Principle
In a Camp test, a main streak of *Staphylococcus aureus* is made on a [[Culture media for bacteria | culture media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:95">[01:26:95]</a>. A streak of the unknown bacterium, suspected to be *Streptococcus agalactiae*, is made perpendicular to the *Staphylococcus aureus* streak, without touching it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:95">[01:13:95]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:95">[01:16:95]</a>.

### Positive Result
A positive Camp test is indicated by the formation of an arrow-shaped zone of enhanced hemolysis at the intersection point of the two streaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:59">[01:44:59]</a>. This occurs because *Streptococcus agalactiae* produces a diffusible extracellular protein (the CAMP factor) that acts synergistically with the beta-lysin produced by *Staphylococcus aureus*, leading to increased red blood cell lysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:71">[01:51:71]</a>.

### Clinical Relevance
*Streptococcus agalactiae* is a significant pathogen, particularly in neonates and infants, where it can cause conditions such as meningitis and pneumonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:83">[03:00:83]</a>. Therefore, the Camp test is crucial for its identification in clinical samples, which may be obtained through [[Microbial culture and staining techniques | blood culture and spinal tap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

## Reverse Camp Test

While the Camp test identifies *Streptococcus agalactiae*, a related test, the reverse Camp test, serves a different diagnostic purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

### Procedure and Principle
In the reverse Camp test, the main streak is *Clostridium perfringens*, and *Streptococcus agalactiae* is used as the known streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Purpose
The reverse Camp test is specifically used for the diagnosis of *Clostridium perfringens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

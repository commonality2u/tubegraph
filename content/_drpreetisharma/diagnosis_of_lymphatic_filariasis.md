Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic infection characterized by the presence of sheathed microfilaria in blood investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:19">[02:51:19]</a>. This condition often presents with lymphadenitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>.

## Identification of Sheathed Microfilaria

When a sheathed microfilaria is identified, it typically points to one of three species, often remembered by the acronym LBW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:34">[02:57:34]</a>:
*   *Loa loa* (L) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:05">[03:01:05]</a>
*   *Brugia malayi* (B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:48">[03:02:48]</a>
*   *Wuchereria bancrofti* (W) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:44">[03:04:44]</a>

The sheath appears as an orange-colored layer around the filaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>.

## Differentiating Sheathed Microfilaria

Differentiation between these three species is primarily based on the presence or absence of nuclei at the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>. This requires focusing on the tail end of the microfilaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:19">[03:35:19]</a>.

### *Wuchereria bancrofti*
*   **Tail Tip Nuclei**: No nuclei are present at the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>. The nuclei end before the tip, as if they have "vanished like magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Often associated with elephantiasis and chyluria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:34">[05:07:34]</a>.

### *Brugia malayi*
*   **Tail Tip Nuclei**: There are typically two distinct nuclei present at the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:30">[04:00:30]</a>.

### *Loa loa*
*   **Tail Tip Nuclei**: A continuous line of nuclei is seen extending right till the end of the tail tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:29">[04:09:29]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Also known as the "African eye worm," as the worm can be visualized in the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:31">[06:22:31]</a>. It can also cause Kalabar swelling, which is a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by swelling and redness in the hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:09">[06:38:09]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations and Associated Conditions

### Elephantiasis
*   **Description**: A classical presentation of filariasis, characterized by a swollen limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:20">[04:36:20]</a>.
*   **Cause**: Occurs due to obstruction of the lymphatics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:10">[04:39:10]</a>.

### Chyluria
*   **Description**: If lymphatic channels become severely obstructed and burst, lymph can leak into the urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:13">[04:52:13]</a>. The urine will appear milky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:21">[05:01:21]</a>.
*   **Etymology**: "Kyle" refers to lymph, and "ura" refers to urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:15">[04:59:15]</a>.

### Differentiation from other filarial infections

*   **Onchocerca volvulus**: This filarial species is *unsheathed* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:52">[05:22:52]</a>. It is known to cause "leopard skin" or dermatitis (black skin, often seen in the black population) and is transmitted by black flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:03">[05:27:03]</a>. It also causes "river blindness," which is characterized by sclerosing keratitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a>. The drug of choice for river blindness is Ivermectin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:37">[06:11:37]</a>. This is distinct from lymphatic filariasis.

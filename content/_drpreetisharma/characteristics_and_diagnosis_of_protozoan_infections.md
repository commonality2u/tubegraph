From: [[_drpreetisharma]] <br/> 

This article outlines the characteristics and diagnostic approaches for various protozoan infections, drawing from a discussion on parasitology.

## Introduction to Parasitic Quizzes

The class focuses on 15 questions related to parasitic infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. These weekly classes will continue, though on varying days due to external commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Future topics include a virology quiz and special sessions on IAI CET topics in Pathology and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. Daily quizzes with audio descriptions and topic-wise messages will be posted on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

The discussion emphasizes the importance of practicing Q-bank questions for microbiology, as main videos cover about 85% of content, and the remaining 15% comes from Q-bank practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.

## Specific Protozoan Infections and Their Characteristics

### [[Balantidium Coli Characteristics and Infection | Balantidium Coli]]

*   **Characteristics**:
    *   It is a ciliated protozoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
    *   It infects the large intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   It is the largest protozoa known in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
    *   Both its cyst and trophozoite forms are binucleated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
    *   The macronucleus is kidney-shaped, and there is a small micronucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
    *   It exhibits rotatory motility due to cilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Infective Stage**: The cyst is the infective stage, as its wall allows it to survive better in the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Causes bloody loose stools, fever, and abdominal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. It also causes diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Reservoir**: Pigs are a common reservoir for Balantidium Coli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Treatment**: Doxycycline is the treatment of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Entamoeba Species

*   **Differentiation (Entamoeba histolytica vs. Entamoeba coli)**:
    *   **Motility/Pseudopodia**: *Entamoeba histolytica* has sharp, "knife-like" pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, while *Entamoeba coli* has blunt pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
    *   **Nucleus (Karyosome)**: *Entamoeba histolytica* has a centrally placed karyosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, whereas *Entamoeba coli* has an eccentrically placed karyosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
    *   **Erythrophagocytosis**: *Entamoeba histolytica* trophozoites show erythrophagocytosis (eating red blood cells), appearing as multiple dots (RBCs) inside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. *Entamoeba coli* does not exhibit erythrophagocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
    *   **Cyst Nuclei Count**: *Entamoeba histolytica* cysts typically have 1-4 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, while *Entamoeba coli* cysts can have 1-8 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
    *   **Chromatoid Bodies**: Chromatoid bodies are made of ribonucleoproteins (RNP) and are stained with Iron Haematoxylin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. In *Entamoeba histolytica*, they are thick, while in *Entamoeba coli*, they are thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentations**:
    *   *Entamoeba histolytica* causes flask-shaped ulcers in the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
    *   In the liver, *Entamoeba histolytica* can cause abscesses with an "anchovy sauce" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
    *   *Entamoeba coli* is often visible in normal stool samples and may not require treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

    *   **Transmission**: Occurs through nasal entry of contaminated water (e.g., drain water, diving in freshwater), which then penetrates the cribriform plate to reach the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. It primarily takes a neural route rather than a blood route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Acanthamoeba vs. Balamuthia mandrillaris**:
    *   **Clinical Presentation**: Both cause Granulomatous Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (GAME) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

    *   **Morphology**:
        *   *Acanthamoeba* trophozoites have spike-like projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>, and its cysts have a wrinkled appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
        *   *Balamuthia mandrillaris* trophozoites are fish-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>, and its cysts are smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.
    *   **Other Diseases**: *Acanthamoeba* also causes keratitis and corneal ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. *Balamuthia mandrillaris* does not cause these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

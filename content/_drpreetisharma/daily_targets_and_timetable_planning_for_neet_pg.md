This article focuses on a detailed [[planning_strategy_for_neetpg_2025 | planning strategy]] and [[creating_a_personalized_study_timetable | personalized study timetable]] specifically for students preparing for the NEET PG exam on March 3rd. Students appearing for FMGE should refer to their dedicated session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Daily Targets
Daily targets are designed for Pathology and Microbiology. These targets will be provided in the form of a G-sheet, listing topics to cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Students should cover these topics from their Rapid Revision (RR) videos or their preferred study source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. The goal is to finish these two subjects daily, taking about 40-40 minutes each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Kickstart Morning Sessions
"Kickstart Morning" sessions are early morning live sessions designed to encourage students to wake up early and start their day productively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
These sessions will begin after students have completed one round of Pathology and Microbiology from their RR videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. The sessions will focus on MCQ-based discussions, integrating questions to make learning more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

## Study Material Approach: Main Videos vs. Rapid Revision
The choice between main videos and rapid revision depends on prior preparation and subject difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### When to use Rapid Revision (RR)
If you have already studied everything at least once (85-90% coverage), it is advisable to go for rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### When to use Main Videos
Certain subjects are bulky, high-yield, or notoriously difficult, and for these, referring to main videos is recommended, even with limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Final Year Subjects**: Medicine, Surgery, and OBGY, as they are "deadly," bulky, and yield many questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
*   **PSM (Community Medicine)**: Questions can be "crooked" or atypical, requiring in-depth information beyond rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
*   **Anatomy**: If you are weak in Anatomy, rapid revision might be insufficient and feel like "further torture." Main videos can bridge the understanding gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
*   **"Nightmare Subjects"**: For subjects that cause significant fear (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology), dedicate time to their main videos to overcome the "scare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:00">[38:08:00]</a>.

### Importance of QBank
Rapid Revision alone is often not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:58:00">[33:58:00]</a>. It must be complemented with a Q Bank to bridge knowledge gaps and ensure thorough understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:12:00">[34:12:00]</a>. For bulky subjects (Medicine, Surgery, Gynecology, PSM, Anatomy, Pharma), use the main Q Bank. For shorter subjects, the RR Q Bank can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>.

## Previous Year Topics (PYTT)
Focus on Previous Year Topics (PYTT) as they are crucial for NEET PG preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. PYTTs are readily available on platforms like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
*   **NEET PG**: Aim to cover PYQs from the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>.
*   **INI-CET**: Focus on the last three years of INI-CET PYQs due to changes in its pattern and increasing overlap with NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a>.
*   **FMGE**: Watch dedicated PYQ sessions (e.g., on PrepLadder) which cover 5 years of FMGE PYQs in 2-2.5 hour videos per subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:27:00">[35:27:00]</a>.

Only relying on PYQs for a good rank in NEET PG is not sufficient; they are "overhyped." PYQ *topics* are important, especially with rapid revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21:00">[36:21:00]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs) Strategy
Allocate half a day for Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.
*   **Time Allocation**: Approximately 3.5 hours for the exam, and the remaining half-day for quick analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **Analysis**: Do not spend too much time on explanations for correct answers, as you are already revising notes daily. Focus on analyzing incorrect answers to understand why they were wrong (silly mistake, unknown topic, new concept, time management issue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: Fortnightly (one GT every two weeks) is ideal for most students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. If GTs cause significant demotivation, consider taking one every three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
*   **Mindset**: View GTs as a tool to identify mistakes and practice [[time_management_and_study_scheduling | time management]], rather than a final assessment of your rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

## The 3-Round Revision Timetable
The provided timetable spans three rounds, covering the entire syllabus until the NEET PG exam on March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

### Round 1 (Until January 10th)
This round is designed to be "comfortable," allowing for thorough coverage.
*   **Baseline GT**: Take a Grand Test today to establish a baseline, without judging yourself on the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.
*   **Subject-wise Days**:
    *   Anatomy: 5 days (can be reduced to 3 if using RR notes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.
    *   Orthopedics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>.
    *   Biochemistry: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.
    *   ENT: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>.

    *   PSM: 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:57:00">[17:57:00]</a>.
    *   Surgery: 6 days (can be 5 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.
    *   Radiology: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>.
    *   OBGY: 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>.
    *   Ophthalmology (Ophth): 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.
    *   FMT (Forensic Medicine & Toxicology): 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.
    *   Pediatrics: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>.
    *   Pharmacology: 4 days (can be 2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.
*   **Medicine Integration**: Dedicate 1.5-2 hours to Medicine daily alongside other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. This ensures continuous integration and reduces tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.
*   **Pending/Buffer Days**: Integrate "pending" days (backlog or GT days) throughout the schedule to account for unforeseen delays, emergencies, or anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.
*   **Daily MCQs**: Aim to solve 100-150 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>. Start by gradually increasing your daily question count if you're not at this level yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>.

### Round 2 (January 11th onwards)
This round focuses on revising.
*   Medicine: 4 days for a full revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>.

*   Physiology: 1 day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.
*   Pharmacology: 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.
*   Pediatrics: 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>.
*   Surgery and OBGY: 3 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>.

### Round 3 (Starting February 8th)
This is the final rapid revision phase before the exam.
*   Short Subjects: Finish all six short subjects (ENT, Ophth, Physio, etc.) in less than a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>.
*   Medicine: Quickly revise in 3 days for the last time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>.
*   Pharmacology and PSM: 2 days each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>.
*   Other Subjects: 1-2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>.
*   Volatile Subjects: Allocate the last week for volatile subjects like Anatomy, Biochemistry, and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>.

## Customization and Mindset
The timetable is designed to be flexible and "comfortable," accounting for individual needs and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>.

### Customization
*   You can adjust the order of subjects based on your remaining syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.
*   If you are using RR notes for a subject, you can reduce the allocated days (e.g., Anatomy from 5 to 3 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.
*   If you prefer dual subjects (half day big subject, half day short subject), you can customize the [[time_management_and_daily_study_schedule | daily schedule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

### Interns' Timetable
Interns should follow the same subject sequence, but add one extra day to each subject's allocation to account for less study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>.
*   **Source**: Only use Rapid Revision notes and a Q Bank, avoiding main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a>.
*   **Short Subjects**: Finish short subjects quickly (e.g., Psychiatry, Radiology, Ortho, Anesthesia, Forensic, Skin) by utilizing 15-day internship postings where work is light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>.
*   **Pathology and Microbiology**: Follow daily targets, even while on duty, by having videos switched on during downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.

### Managing Anxiety and Self-Doubt
It's common to not feel confident even after multiple revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:28:00">[39:28:00]</a>. To build confidence, focus on solving questions and getting them right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:45:00">[39:45:00]</a>.

*   **Nightmare Subjects**: Confront subjects you fear (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology) by studying them thoroughly from notes/main videos and solving their Q Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:35:00">[40:35:00]</a>.
*   **Past Results**: Do not dwell on past exam ranks or GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:46:00">[48:46:00]</a>. Focus on what you can do from today onwards with honesty and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:00">[49:00:00]</a>.
*   **Practicality**: Acknowledge that interruptions like illness, emergencies, or anxiety are normal. The timetable accounts for these realities to prevent backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

## Daily Study Routine and Breaks
*   **Study Hours**: 10-11 hours of pure study output per day is considered excellent and should not be changed or increased if it's working for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:23:00">[44:23:00]</a>.
*   **Study Stretches**: Instead of Pomodoro Technique (which is better for long-term preparation), focus on longer, sustained study stretches of 2-2.5 hours to train your mind for exam duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
*   **Breaks**: Take a 15-minute break after a long stretch. How you use this break (e.g., avoiding social media) is personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.

## Integrated vs. Subject-wise Timetable
An integrated system-wise timetable (e.g., 10 body systems) often leads to neglecting general subjects (e.g., General Pathology, General Microbiology, General Surgery, Biochemistry, Forensics) that do not fit neatly into systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:20:00">[53:20:00]</a>. The subject-wise approach with daily Medicine integration and regular GTs ensures comprehensive coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:12:00">[54:12:00]</a>.

## Last-Minute Revision (LRR)
Last-minute revision (LRR) videos will be conducted in January and February for NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>. These sessions will focus on high-yield, volatile topics and often include PYQ discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. However, LRR alone is not a substitute for thorough preparation from main videos or rapid revision notes supplemented with Q Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

The comprehensive timetable and daily targets will be shared as a PDF on Telegram for students to follow starting tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

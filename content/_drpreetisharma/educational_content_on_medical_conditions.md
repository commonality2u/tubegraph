## Image of the Day Series

A daily "Image of the Day" series is available on Telegram and Facebook, uploading images and discussions related to medical cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This series aims to assist with difficult cases by providing pictorial representations such as slide instruments, culture media, and charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Specific Medical Conditions and Topics Covered

### [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | Brain Tumors]]

The series includes content on [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | brain tumors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, particularly focusing on [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | oligodendroglioma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Key microscopic features highlighted include:
*   "Fried egg appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a> with white space around the cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   The presence of [[general_pathology_and_immunology_topics | chickenwire blood vessels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
These features are described as "very good and very important" for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

### [[medical_conditions_related_to_esophagus_and_stomach | Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)]] and [[medical_conditions_related_to_esophagus_and_stomach | Barrett's Esophagus]]

Content addresses [[medical_conditions_related_to_esophagus_and_stomach | long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, which can lead to conditions like [[medical_conditions_related_to_esophagus_and_stomach | Barrett's Esophagus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Pathophysiology:** The content explains the mechanism of [[medical_conditions_related_to_esophagus_and_stomach | metaplasia]], describing it as a protective phenomenon where one mature cell type is replaced by another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. This is a form of cellular reprogramming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **Microscopy:** Microscopic images show "pink colour patches" and "pink colour columnar epithelial" cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

### Other Topics

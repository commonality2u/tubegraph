During [[pathology_residency_orientation | pathology residency]], engaging in paper writing is encouraged to enhance a resident's academic profile and research skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Types of Publications for Residents

Pathology residents can focus on several types of publications:

### Original Articles
Writing original articles requires significant research and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. It is a cumulative effort that does not happen overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The speaker, for example, wrote two to three original articles during her residency and senior residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. It is common for residents to not write many original articles during their initial postgraduate (PG) years due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, but more time might become available during senior residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Residents should not feel overwhelmed if they haven't written an article yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Case Reports
Writing case reports is generally faster for residents compared to original articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. A case report does not necessarily need to be an "out of the world" or "one in a million" case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Residents can even compile a series of four to five cases to present a new perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The speaker offers to guide residents through the process of writing these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Reviews
Review articles are typically undertaken during senior residency, as they are extensive, almost like writing a mini-book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The speaker's favorite review was on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis due to a personal interest in genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. She also pursued an online course in genetics, which took 4 to 5 months, to deepen her understanding of genomics and precision oncology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Academic Development in Residency
Beyond publications, academic development involves:
*   **Reading textbooks**: It is crucial to continuously read textbooks like Robins, which forms the starting point for theoretical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **Journal Clubs**: Keeping up with recent articles is a very important part of academics, often done through journal clubs, aiming to read at least one article per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. This helps in understanding new immunohistochemical markers, genetic analyses, and emerging genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.
*   **Self-Study**: Even in departments with active academic programs, residents, especially first-year residents, often have to study on their own due to demanding schedules and exhaustion from grossing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. If a department lacks strong academics, residents are responsible for their own academic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

For specific guidance, residents can join a dedicated Telegram group where discussions on interesting cases, slide morphology, and viva questions occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The speaker plans to share audio descriptions for these cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. She also notes that postgraduate residents are often the most knowledgeable in the field because they are constantly engaging with textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.

Post-MD, individuals enter a "wish zone" where they can choose to take a break from studies or pursue further certificate courses to upscale their knowledge in specific areas, such as hepatopathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. Online courses and webinars make continuous learning accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

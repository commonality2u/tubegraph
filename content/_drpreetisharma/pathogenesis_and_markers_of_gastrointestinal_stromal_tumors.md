Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) is a mesenchymal tumor that can occur in the stomach or intestine, with the stomach being the more common location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[11:10]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A patient might present with upper gastrointestinal (GI) pain and tar stools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[10:24]</a>. Endoscopy could reveal a firm, smooth, yellowish submucosal mass in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[10:29]</a>.

## Pathological Features
Biopsy of a GIST typically reveals [[identification_of_spindle_cells_and_mesenchyme_tumors | spindle cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[10:48]</a>, indicating it is a mesenchymal or stromal tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[10:50]</a>. The cells appear elongated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[10:56]</a>.

## Cell of Origin
GIST originates from the Cells of Cajal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[11:17]</a>, which are normally known as the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[11:22]</a>.

## Genetic Mutations and Pathogenesis
GIST arises due to specific mutations within the Cells of Cajal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[11:28]</a>.
The most common mutation associated with GIST is the CD117 or KIT mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[11:31]</a>. This mutation leads to an increase in tyrosine kinase activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[11:40]</a>.

Other mutations that can be seen include:
*   PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor) mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[12:16]</a>
*   SDH (Succinate Dehydrogenase) mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[12:19]</a>, which is typically observed in pediatric GIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[12:28]</a>.

## Diagnostic Markers
*   The most sensitive marker for GIST is KIT (also known as CD117) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[12:35]</a>.
*   The specific marker is DOG1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[12:42]</a>, which stands for "Diagnostic Of GIST" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[12:48]</a>.

## Treatment
While surgery is the ideal treatment for a tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[11:46]</a>, a medical drug used for GIST is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[11:52]</a> called Imatinib <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[11:58]</a>. Imatinib is also used in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[12:00]</a>.

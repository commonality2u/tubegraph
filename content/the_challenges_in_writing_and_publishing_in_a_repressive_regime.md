The act of writing and publishing under a repressive political system, such as Mao Zedong's China, presented profound challenges and dangers. This article explores these difficulties, drawing solely from the experiences and observations of author Jung Chang as detailed in a podcast episode.

## The Suppressed Desire to Write

Jung Chang harbored a lifelong ambition to be a writer, having loved writing since childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. However, under Mao's rule, pursuing such a dream was virtually impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Dangers Faced by Writers
During Mao's era, writers were systematically targeted. Chang notes that nearly all writers were condemned, sent to the gulag, driven to suicide, and some were even executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Even writing for oneself was considered dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This created an environment where creative expression was fraught with peril.

### Personal Experience with Censorship
Chang's first attempt at writing, a poem penned on her 16th birthday (around 1968, given the context of the Cultural Revolution and Red Guard activity), was abruptly curtailed. As she was "publishing" it in bed, Red Guards raided her flat. Fearing the repercussions for herself and her family if the poem was discovered, she had to quickly tear it up and flush it down the toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This incident marked the end of her "first venture in writing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Writing in Secret: The "Imaginary Pen"
Despite the risks, the desire to write never left Chang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. During the years she worked in various manual labor roles—as a peasant, a "barefoot doctor," a steelworker, and an electrician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>—she continued to write in her head "with an imaginary pen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Actual writing was impossible in China at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## The Path to Publication in Britain
After moving to Britain, Chang initially refrained from writing about her past for ten years, finding the memories too painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The catalyst for her to finally write came in 1988 when her mother visited and shared stories of her life and Chang's grandmother's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Listening to these accounts, Chang felt compelled to document them and realized the depth of her lifelong aspiration to be a writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. After her mother left, Chang transcribed 60 hours of tape recordings and subsequently wrote *Wild Swans*, which was published in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Modern Censorship and Access in China
While Chang's books, including *Wild Swans* and *Mao: The Unknown Story*, gained international recognition, they remain banned in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.

### Early Post-Publication Period
In the 1990s and early 2000s, there were various ways for her books to enter China, including through Hong Kong, Taiwan, and numerous pirated editions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

### Current Clampdown
Since Xi Jinping came to power (around 2012-2013), China has enforced a "total clampdown" on banned literature [[china_and_the_uss_race_in_ai_and_superintelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.
*   **Consequences:** Possessing banned books, including Chang's, can lead to severe punishment, potentially jail time, especially for officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>.
*   **Border Warnings:** Warnings are displayed upon entering China against bringing in "bad literature," particularly books critical of previous revolutionary leaders or martyrs [[the_impact_of_mao_zedongs_policies_on_chinese_society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.
*   **Restrictions on Historical Research:** There is a prohibition on people conducting research on history or trying to understand it independently, contributing to the indoctrination of new generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.

## Broader Context of Information Control

The difficulty of writing and accessing diverse information stemmed from the regime's comprehensive control mechanisms:
*   **Isolation and Brainwashing:** Society was completely isolated from the outside world and alternative information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Intense brainwashing and indoctrination were pervasive [[the_psychological_manipulation_and_indoctrination_in_totalitarian_regimes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Culture of Fear:** Intense terror was used to scare people into suppressing any unorthodox thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Self-Censorship within Families:** Parents often refrained from telling their children things that differed from the party line, fearing for their children's future and the family's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This practice continues, with parents who had bad experiences under Mao often not sharing them, leaving younger generations genuinely uninformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>.

These conditions created a "cultural desert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> where independent thought and creative writing were severely stifled, making the act of writing an extraordinary challenge and the publication of dissenting views nearly impossible within the country's borders.

Average crypto users are experiencing growing resentment towards the traditional dynamics of new token launches and the broader crypto market [00:00:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">00:00:18</a>). This sentiment is driven by several key factors:

## Causes of Resentment

*   **Perception of Scams and Insider-Driven Launches** Many new token launches are viewed as scams or "Insider driven" stories, where the "rich get richer" [00:00:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>).
*   **Lack of Early Access** Even when legitimate opportunities arise, average users often lack the chance to participate early [00:00:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">00:00:13</a>).
*   **Feeling "Dumped On" by Insiders** Users express frustration at consistently being exploited by insiders [00:00:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">00:00:53</a>).

## Shift to Meme Coins

This disillusionment leads users to disengage from traditional market types and seek more "honest" alternatives [00:00:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">00:00:27</a>). A prominent alternative is the [[role_of_meme_coins_in_crypto_ecosystem | meme coin]] [00:00:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">00:00:31</a>).

The appeal of [[role_of_meme_coins_in_crypto_ecosystem | meme coins]] stems from their perceived fairness:
*   **No Insiders** They are seen as having no insiders [00:00:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">00:00:32</a>).
*   **Fair and Level Playing Field** They offer a very level playing field for all participants [00:00:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">00:00:35</a>).

## Impact on the Market

The increasing popularity of [[the_growing_popularity_of_meme_coins | meme coins]] is expected to continue [00:00:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">00:00:37</a>). This trend may force "insiders" in the traditional crypto space to adopt more honest practices, as they will be directly competing against the transparency offered by [[the_growing_popularity_of_meme_coins | meme coins]] [00:00:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">00:00:45</a>).

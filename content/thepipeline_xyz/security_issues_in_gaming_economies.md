Creating a good game is considered a primary bottleneck in gaming development, even more so than creating an on-chain game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The suggested approach is to first create a fun game and then integrate on-chain components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. For instance, the concept of Roblox incorporating [[role_of_nfts_in_gaming | NFTs]] makes sense, but Roblox was established first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Existing In-Game Economies and Security Challenges

Despite the potential for [[potential_for_crypto_in_payments_and_gaming | crypto]] to offer more secure alternatives, gamers have long engaged in informal trading practices that are prone to security issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Examples include:
*   Gamers trading CS:GO skins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   The RuneScape gray market for gold, which has existed for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Users in these markets often face scams, with instances of them "wire transferring to some random anon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These existing systems are significantly less secure than [[potential_for_crypto_in_payments_and_gaming | crypto]]-based alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Building and sustaining a [[startups_in_crypto | crypto startup]] during a market downturn presents unique [[challenges_and_strategies_for_crypto_startups | challenges]], requiring adaptability, a solid business plan, and resilience.

## Challenges Faced by Crypto Startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>

*   **Narrative Shift and Investor Appetite**: Fundraising in a bull market can be deceiving. Investors' willingness to fund changes drastically when the market narrative shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. For example, Flip's focus on NFTs faced headwinds as the market for JPEGs declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.
*   **Funding Miscalculations**: Founders often make the mistake of raising less at a lower valuation, hoping to raise more later, only to find the market sentiment has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Dev Fatigue**: When the market is saturated with "degenerate liquidity" plays like memecoins, talented developers may experience fatigue, seeing quick profits elsewhere compared to the slow, hard work of building real products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. This can be disheartening for those focused on legitimate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **Lack of Product-Market Fit for Real-World Applications**: While the vision for NFTs as titles or deeds for real-world assets is strong, the market often doesn't care for it in the short term, prioritizing speculative JPEGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Focus**: The crypto industry often remains too "insulated," focusing on internal crypto ecosystems rather than applying blockchain technology to real-world industries that genuinely need disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

## Strategies for Sustainability and Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>

*   **Comprehensive Business Plan**: Develop a business plan that ensures sustainability for your team for the long term, thinking in terms of 5-10 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. A successful startup journey to sustainable revenue often takes over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Early Fundraising**: Raise as much capital as possible early on, regardless of valuation, to have the flexibility to deploy funds as needed, rather than being beholden to investor timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.
*   **Lean Operations**: Be lean from the start and maintain leanness to power through market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
*   **Bridge Revenue and User Growth**: If possible, establish a "cash cow" or a bridge revenue stream while simultaneously building a user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>. Continuous fundraising without a clear business model leaves you at the whim of market narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.
*   **Focus on Real-World Application**:
    *   Instead of building within the crypto ecosystem, use crypto tools to disrupt traditional industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
    *   Target less-regulated marketplaces first, where blockchain technology can offer significant efficiency improvements (e.g., tracking ownership, maintenance, and history of assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.
    *   The crypto element should be completely invisible to the end-user, with seamless fiat conversion and user authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example: Richie Brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>
> Richie Brothers (RB Auction) is a $7 billion company that auctions construction equipment. Despite being a large marketplace, its information is inefficient. Ledger envisions a blockchain solution where every piece of service history, hours, metadata, and ownership history of a construction vehicle could be on-chain, improving transparency and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

## Personal and Philosophical Advice for Founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>

*   **Stay Grounded**: It's easy for greed and the desire for wealth to become one's identity in crypto, which is "extraordinarily dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>. Your identity should not be tied to your net worth or outperforming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.
*   **Define Your Endgame**: Identify your financial and quality-of-life goals. Know "what is enough" and what sacrifices you've made to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.
*   **Take Profits**: Always encourage taking some money off the table, even if it feels counterintuitive at the moment. Don't chase a "home run" after hitting a double or triple, risking losing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.
*   **Reinvest Wisely**: Once profits are secured, analyze how to approach life optimization and invest in yourself, your community, your family, and long-term financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>. Even with average returns, long-term compounding can build generational wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The "Skinny Door" Analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>
> Many participants (fat people) try to exit through a limited liquidity channel (the skinny door). If large holders ("some VC or some meme coin degenerate King") decide to dump, the market can collapse, leaving smaller investors with no opportunity to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This low liquidity and high concentration of supply in a few hands are common in projects like memecoins.

Ultimately, Ledger expresses concern that if the crypto industry doesn't focus on building real, impactful applications, it will fulfill the prophecy of being perceived as "a bunch of scammers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>. The [[challenges_and_strategies_in_building_crypto_infrastructure | infrastructure layer]] is doing well, but the application layer is largely failing to deliver real-world value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.

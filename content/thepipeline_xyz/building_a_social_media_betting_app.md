Kizzy is an application currently being developed, described as the world's first [[social_media_betting_platforms | social media betting app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Developer's Motivation

The developer behind Kizzy expresses significant passion for the project, stating they wake up excited every single day to work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This contrasts sharply with a previous job where such enthusiasm was absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Collaborative Approach to Development

A key personal insight for the developer has been the realization that they "can't work alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Having grown up as a triplet, they have always had people around them, a preference that extends to their professional endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The developer enjoys collaborating with others and acknowledges not possessing all the necessary skills to build the platform independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This collaborative mindset is crucial for tackling the [[challenges_of_creating_a_new_social_platform | challenges of creating a new social platform]] like Kizzy.

[[the_rise_of_social_media_and_influencer_markets | Influence]] is a complex phenomenon, with some individuals naturally excelling at generating engagement, while others do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This dynamic was explored in the "Monad Games" competition, which featured contestants who are "professional [[community_engagement_and_influencers | engagement farmers]]" and others who produce "banger original posts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Defining Influence

The competition aimed to determine "who's the biggest yapper," framing influence through a measure of "yappingness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Contestants initially ranked themselves from most to least influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, considering factors such as a "six figure follower count" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> and whether influence was tied to a personal brand or a corporate entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Assessing and Leveraging Influence

A professional psychic was brought in to provide an external assessment, arranging contestants based purely on intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### Psychic Assessment Traits:
During the psychic readings, various traits were identified as potentially contributing to or detracting from influence:
*   **Organizational skills**: Being a "great organizer" and liking to "plan things out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Empathy and caregiving**: Being an empath who reacts to others' feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, and being a "caregiver" who looks out for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Performance and entertainment**: Liking the "stage" and wanting to "act" and "perform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Secretive nature**: Being "secretive" and preferring to be "in the back and do your organizing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Love for challenges**: Liking "new challenges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Anonymity**: Using a mask to "say whatever I want" without "too many repercussions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Avoidance of spotlight**: Not preferring to be "in the spotlight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Resourcefulness**: Being the type of person to "take it and pocket it" if there's "a lighter on the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

Contestants then had 15 seconds to plead their case for being the most influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Winning this challenge meant a prize of 1,000 mana tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

## Pitching Ideas for Influence

A subsequent challenge, "Hot or Not," involved pitching fictional business ideas, emphasizing that a "billion-dollar idea" is only viable if it can be effectively pitched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Ideas ranged from an "AI powered unsolicited NADS filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a> to "Work to Earn," a concept that gamifies work tracking and rewards time spent on the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Another concept, "Couch Confessional," was an "AI priest" where users could confess secrets to "big data which promises not to use them against you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. This fictional product had a V2 concept involving its own blockchain (L2 evolving to L1) that would reward users with more tokens based on how "bad your secrets were" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

## [[community_engagement_and_influencers | Community Engagement]] and Reward

The ultimate winner of the Monad Games competition received $5,000 to give away to the [[community_engagement_and_influencers | community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. The winner, Professor Pipelines, ultimately decided to split the prize among three "OG Monad community members" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>, reinforcing the importance of [[building_and_engaging_with_online_communities | community engagement]] and direct rewards within the Monad ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. This act showcased a practical application of influence directed back into the community.

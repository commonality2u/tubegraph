Pancakes_BR, known for cultivating "Good Vibes" and "wholesome Vibes" on Crypto Twitter, discusses his journey and offers insights into building a personal brand within the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. His approach emphasizes authenticity, community engagement, and a long-term mindset over short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## The Power of Authenticity and Wholesome Vibes

Initially, Pancakes_BR's account started with a more aggressive, joking tone but evolved into a wholesome one by him simply "being myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He found that being genuine and honest acted as a "growth hack" for [[navigating_the_crypto_market_and_career_opportunities | networking in the space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While the crypto community can be "Cutthroat," maintaining a positive attitude is rare and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Accidental Wholesomeness
> Pancakes_BR admits his wholesome persona was accidental; he intended to be a "worst traitor possible" and annoying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, he realized people found his goofy, non-confrontational replies endearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. He also discovered that this approach won people over, even those initially annoyed, leading to strong friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Networking and Community Engagement

A significant part of building his brand involved deep engagement with the crypto community:
*   **Early Connections**: He learned about crypto in 2017 but didn't engage with the community until 2021 when he created his Pancakes_BR account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Connections**: An early retweet from Kobe helped kickstart his growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. His friendship with Grug led him into "Grug Hub," a high-alpha group chat that introduced him to many influential people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Conference Circuit**: After a lucky NFT sale provided funds, he attended conferences like NFT NYC and Breakpoint, meeting many key figures and strengthening relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Meeting "anonymous accounts" in person helped build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **The "Reply Guy" Strategy**: He actively engaged by "reply guying really hard" â€“ being funny, nice, or "obnoxiously stupid" on purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This gained him approximately 100 followers per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Being Approachable**: He advises engaging with every person who comments on posts and replying to every DM, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. People remember and respect this level of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. His own account, with 24K followers, gets engagement comparable to 50-60K accounts due to his engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

## Content Strategy and Online Presence

Pancakes_BR's approach to content creation is spontaneous and genuine:
*   **Authenticity over Planning**: He doesn't schedule tweets in advance, preferring to "pick up my phone and say whatever just kind of comes out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Original Content**: To grow an account, he recommends making most of your timeline consist of your own tweets rather than retweeting too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. People want to see your content, not others' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Reading the Room**: Understanding the sentiment of the timeline is crucial, especially during significant events like the FTX collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Protocols showing empathy or using appropriate humor (e.g., self-deprecating) demonstrates understanding of the culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   **Humanizing Brands**: He advises companies to "have someone on your Twitter who's a human being" and can "just really just be a person behind your logo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. This authenticity helps companies connect with the crypto audience, which is "put off by tourists or like corporate is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

## Long-Term Vision and [[importance_of_maintaining_a_positive_reputation_in_crypto | Reputation Management]]

A critical element of his strategy was prioritizing long-term growth and [[importance_of_maintaining_a_positive_reputation_in_crypto | reputation]] over quick money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   **Rejecting Paid Shills**: He consistently turned down paid shilling opportunities, even when "super broke," intuitively feeling it wouldn't be a good idea for the "long game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. He believes this decision led to better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
*   **Trust as Currency**: Earning trust is paramount in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. If people trust you, opportunities are "unlimited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Conflict**: He actively avoids arguments and "beef" on the timeline, opting to reply in a "silly way" if confronted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Self-Responsibility**: He believes "whatever ever happens in crypto is 100% your fault," promoting a mindset of personal accountability and avoiding blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This mindset helps maintain high spirits and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   **Collective Success**: He advocates for a "we're all on the same team" mindset, emphasizing that tribalism and infighting hinder the broader adoption of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. Success for one protocol or individual ultimately benefits the entire space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.

> [!TIP] The Long Game
> "The difference between short-term and long-term thinking in crypto is huge and extremely underrated and and and maybe you're like the best way to win if if winning to you means you know being a part of the community and getting a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

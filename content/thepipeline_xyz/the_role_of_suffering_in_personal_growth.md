An unconventional belief suggests that experiencing some level of adversity, rather than deep trauma, can contribute to the development of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This perspective posits that if a child is shielded from all negative experiences and "only good thing[s] happen," they might not develop a comedic sensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Adversity and Development

The general sentiment is that life "can't just all be rainbows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> for effective personal development. It is argued that "suffering leads to growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This is also linked to the development of [[the_importance_of_resilience_and_grit_in_development | grit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Helius Labs is a platform founded by MT, aiming to provide the "ultimate developer experience" for the Solana blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. MT, an engineer with a background in applied math, signals, and communications engineering, previously worked at Coinbase as a tech lead for platform engineering, where he helped build features like balance and transaction history displays for different networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This experience exposed him to various Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) solutions and the information asymmetry present in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Mission and Approach

The core thesis behind Helius Labs is to address the lack of useful applications in crypto, which stems from the historical difficulty of building fast, cheap, and scalable applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. Helius aims to provide developers with the necessary tools so they can focus entirely on the product, rather than underlying complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.

MT highlights a common trade-off: higher performance often correlates with a less favorable developer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>. For example, JavaScript is easy to write but less performant, whereas Rust and assembly are harder to write but offer greater performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. Helius Labs seeks to bridge this gap by enabling developers to build performant applications on high-throughput L1s like Solana, while enhancing the developer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.

## Fostering a Strong Developer Community

MT emphasizes the critical role of a strong developer community in the growth of a blockchain ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. He notes that developers are the ones building the applications, making their involvement a must <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Solana, for instance, actively supports its community through hackathons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Attracting developers, especially those from Web2, requires providing an environment where they can [[building_user_experiences_in_crypto_and_web3_integration | build products]] and businesses that scale, focusing on the job's requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. The biggest challenge in tech is often not building the technology itself, but convincing people to care and build on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

> "I think what's going to be the most important is not necessarily the kind of the performance improvements that they're doing it's going to be um cultivating de developers to to come build on that chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>

### Addressing Misinformation

MT believes that a significant problem in crypto is misinformation, often propagated by non-technical individuals who lack the deep domain knowledge of engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. His proposed solution involves more builders speaking out, writing, and producing content, fostering a meritocracy of ideas where the best ones can rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This open discourse, even if it involves correcting falsehoods, is vital to prevent good work on networks from being undermined by "complete lies and narratives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### The Role of Foundational Design

MT is a strong advocate for optimizing blockchain systems from the bottom up. He uses the analogy of building a race car: one should start with designing the best possible engine before working on other components like the chassis or aerodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. In blockchain, this means optimizing the base Layer 1, the "engine," as much as possible, focusing on how software can efficiently leverage hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This approach leads to less fragmentation and a more robust foundation, allowing [[builders_and_developers_in_the_monad_ecosystem | builders]] to focus on product development without worrying about underlying scalability issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

Helius Labs, focused on Solana, operates within this philosophy, contributing to an ecosystem that prioritized a highly optimized L1. MT notes that chains like Solana and Monad share this common approach, ensuring a strong foundation for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

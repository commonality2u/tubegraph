Recent reports indicate that Millennium is purchasing $2 billion worth of Bitcoin, a move considered "bullish" by market observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This significant institutional involvement, alongside entities like the State of Wisconsin trading Bitcoin, highlights a shift towards broader adoption and substantial capital deployment in the cryptocurrency market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Role of Venture Capital in Crypto Development

While some sentiment on Twitter suggests that Venture Capitalists (VCs) are a net negative for the crypto space, equating them with the challenges and opportunities in cryptocurrency investment, and meme coins as an "egalitarian technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, there's a strong argument for their necessity.

Building foundational infrastructure, such as high-performance, low-fee Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains like Monad, requires substantial funding to hire skilled engineers and solve complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This funding enables the creation of new types of applications that were previously impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. Without Venture Capital, these critical developments might not occur, as highly skilled developers typically have high opportunity costs and are not working for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

### VC Perception and Challenges

The perception of VCs is often negative because in the past, many projects were heavily funded by VCs, leading to situations where retail investors were "dumped on" through token unlocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. This has created a challenge for VCs when explaining cryptocurrency to their Limited Partners (LPs), especially when the dominant public conversation revolves around meme coins like Pepe or Harry Potter Obama Sonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. VCs operate under strict mandates and need to present a professional image, making it difficult when the most talked-about aspects of crypto appear frivolous or like "lottery tickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

It's argued that fully diluted meme coins are akin to traditional venture-backed projects where insiders already have their bags, the key difference being that meme coin holdings are already unlocked and liquid, allowing for immediate selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

However, despite these challenges, Venture funding is seen as doing "way, way more positive" for the applications people want to use than is often acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. While meme coins provide a fun and egalitarian way for individuals to make money through their social media component and network effects, money is still essential for building projects with actual utility beyond the community aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

### Transparency in Token Unlocks

A significant issue highlighted is the lack of transparency regarding token unlock schedules in many projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Unlike regulated financial markets where companies must publicly disclose stock sales by founders, crypto projects often make this information difficult to find. This allows some teams to bypass vesting schedules by conducting Over-The-Counter (OTC) deals, which further misaligns incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

## Evolution of Investments and Attention

The crypto space is dynamic, with constant innovation and shifting narratives. The unit cost of attention on Crypto Twitter is considered exceptionally high, potentially 100x more valuable than attention elsewhere, due to the financially engaged audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. This environment encourages growing a fan base on Crypto Twitter as a highly effective strategy for projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

The future of crypto and large investments remains uncertain, as the success of various infrastructure developments (e.g., account abstraction, new blockchain technologies like Monad) will dictate the winning strategies five years from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. New applications can rapidly change sentiment across entire ecosystems, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. Success depends on the order and efficacy of infrastructure rollout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

Ultimately, continuous curiosity is paramount for navigating this evolving landscape, as narratives and successful projects can emerge quickly and unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

Cold wallets are a method for storing cryptocurrency funds where private keys are kept offline, not connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This offline nature is the fundamental aspect of their security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Key Security Features
*   **Offline Storage** The defining characteristic of a cold wallet is that its private keys are offline, meaning they are not connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This offline storage prevents hackers from gaining access unless users make specific mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Security** Cold wallets are considered "far more secure" than [[differences_between_hot_and_cold_wallets | hot wallets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This enhanced security makes them suitable for storing significant amounts of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## User Responsibilities for Security
While cold wallets offer high security, [[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | user security]] also depends on precautions taken by the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Managing Recovery Phrases and Keys
*   **Backup is Crucial** Users must always back up their recovery phrase or keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Offline Storage of Backups** It is vital never to put recovery phrases or keys online, as this would entirely defeat the purpose of using a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Secure Physical Storage** Store recovery phrases or keys in a safe, physical location, ideally on a piece of paper that is fireproof and in a place you know exactly where it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Comparison to Hot Wallets
Cold wallets offer a higher level of security compared to [[difference_between_hot_and_cold_wallets | hot wallets]], which are connected to the internet and thus more susceptible to compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. While [[convenience_of_hot_wallets | hot wallets]] are easy to use for quick on-chain/off-chain transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, [[risks_of_using_hot_wallets | funds are much more likely to be compromised]] on a hot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Therefore, it is advisable not to keep too much cryptocurrency in a hot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

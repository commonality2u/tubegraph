A [[hot_wallets_vs_cold_wallets | cold wallet]] is a method for storing cryptocurrency funds where the private keys are kept offline, meaning they are not connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This offline nature is the core principle of its [[best_practices_for_wallet_security | security]], as it means "nobody's touching it" and "hackers can't get access to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Key Security Advantages
[[Hot_wallets_vs_cold_wallets | Cold wallets]] are considered "far more secure" than [[convenience_and_risks_of_hot_wallets | hot wallets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is because the risk of being [[convenience_and_risks_of_hot_wallets | compromised]] is significantly lower compared to a [[convenience_and_risks_of_hot_wallets | hot wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The primary reason for this enhanced [[best_practices_for_wallet_security | security]] is that the private keys remain offline, preventing remote access by malicious actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Potential Risks and User Error
While inherently more secure, [[hot_wallets_vs_cold_wallets | cold wallets]] can still be compromised if users make "silly mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These mistakes often involve physical loss, misplacement, or improper handling of the recovery phrase or keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Best Practices for Cold Wallet Security
To maintain the [[best_practices_for_wallet_security | security]] of a [[hot_wallets_vs_cold_wallets | cold wallet]], several [[best_practices_for_wallet_security | best practices]] should be followed:

*   **Backup Recovery Phrase/Keys**: Always back up your recovery phrase or keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Keep Keys Offline**: Never put your recovery phrase or keys online, as this would "completely defeat the purpose of having a cold wallet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Secure Physical Storage**: Store your recovery phrase in a safe physical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Ideally, this storage should be:
    *   On a piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   Fireproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   In a place where you "know exactly where it would be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

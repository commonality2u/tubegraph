This article explores the significant growth of [[crypto_twitter | Crypto Twitter]] accounts, their influence on market sentiment, and their role in disseminating information and building community within the crypto space.

## Personal Growth on Crypto Twitter

The guest, Anom, shared his journey in crypto, which began in 2016 during his junior year at Georgia Tech, where he studied computer science and minored in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. His initial exposure was through an emergency technologies class that focused on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. After graduating, while working as a software engineer, his mentor encouraged him to delve deeper into crypto trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Anom's [[crypto_twitter | Crypto Twitter]] account saw substantial growth, particularly during the 2020-2021 bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. He went from approximately 3,000 followers before the last cycle to over 100,000 by its end, primarily by sharing his trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This growth has continued, with Anom gaining between 30,000 and 35,000 followers in a single recent month, a pace he describes as "bull market numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The guests noted that this influx of new followers indicates a rapid return of retail investors to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Anom attributes his recent success to a series of accurate market calls, particularly on Solana, Unibot, Pepe, and Bonk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Being "publicly right in real-time" and calling trades before they happen is seen as a key driver for gaining followers and credibility, as it's difficult to fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Notable Trades and Market Conviction

Anom highlighted Axi (Axie Infinity) as one of his best trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Despite an initial aversion to crypto gaming and viewing Axi as a potential scam, he was able to "flip bias" and go long when it was around $12, eventually seeing it rise above $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. His ability to switch from being bearish on altcoins to going long on Axi before the broader market flipped demonstrated his adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Another significant trade was going long on Solana in August, entering around $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Anom emphasizes the importance of sticking to one's own process and journaling trades to avoid emotional decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. He noted that while he considers both price action and fundamentals, his approach is "definitely more price action" for actual positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. He also highlighted the phenomenon of "left curve bags" or momentum trades on projects he doesn't consider fundamentally sound, recognizing how [[the_influence_of_meme_coins_in_crypto | retail behavior]] can drive prices based on narratives rather than utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Public Perception

The discussion touched upon the "social signaling" and speculative premium in [[the_evolution_of_crypto_markets_and_technologies | crypto markets]], where projects like Hex reached extremely high market caps (e.g., $50 billion) despite being perceived as scams by some and not even listed on major tracking sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This highlights the challenge for new users in distinguishing between projects with genuine [[consumer_crypto_trends_and_developments | fundamental value]] (like Solana) and those primarily driven by hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Price action is acknowledged as the "best marketing tool for all of crypto," drawing attention to the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

The guests discussed the prevailing narratives, noting the continued strength of the L1 (Layer 1) narrative, exemplified by Solana's performance due to its advantages in cost, speed, and user experience over Ethereum mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. They also foresee the L2 (Layer 2) trade remaining significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

A key point is that users lack allegiance to any specific chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. New users, who may not understand technical terms, will simply gravitate towards apps that offer the best experience, regardless of the underlying chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. This underscores the need for scalable infrastructure, as current Ethereum L1 handles about 1 million transactions per day, while mass adoption requires millions of daily active users and billions of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. Solana is noted as one of the first chains to enable true consumer-phase applications requiring high throughput and low fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

### The Challenge of "Normie Perception"

A significant challenge is the "narrative battle" against the public perception of crypto, particularly NFTs, as scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. Anom believes that a viral, genuinely good app could break through this perception, especially if users don't even realize it's crypto-powered initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Drip House**: A free NFT platform on Solana where artists release weekly art using compressed NFTs, onboarding users by providing a free and low-risk entry point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **Parallel**: A card game that can be played without any crypto knowledge, allowing traditional gamers to experience web3 benefits (like owning in-game assets as NFTs) organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.

Anom also highlights two main drivers for the upcoming cycle:
1.  **Gambling**: Crypto provides an easy way for people to gamble, with sports betting being a particularly relevant area where crypto solutions offer a better experience than Web2 alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.
2.  **Fundamental Value**: The need for applications that showcase the true value of crypto without requiring users to bet money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.

## Top Signals and Mass Adoption

The discussion also touched on identifying market tops. Unlike previous cycles where celebrity endorsements (like Tom Brady and Gisele BÃ¼ndchen promoting FTX) were considered top signals, it's now harder to differentiate between a top signal and genuine [[consumer_crypto_trends_and_developments | mass adoption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. If this cycle truly brings product-market fit and daily applications, public awareness might be a confirmation of growth rather than an immediate sell signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Technical analysis is preferred as a more reliable indicator for market tops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.

The market has matured with major corporations like VanEck and Visa releasing reports on Solana, and T-Mobile partnering with Helium, even during the bear market, indicating broader institutional recognition of crypto's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.

Regarding potential "Luna-type" events, Anom hopes for increased caution in stablecoin designs and transparency in exchanges (like Backpack and Cube), but acknowledges that leverage-driven wipeouts and flash crashes are inherent to crypto markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>. The consistent phenomenon of people sending money to anonymous contracts, even with explicit warnings of potential scams, underscores the market's high-risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.

## Getting Involved in Crypto Safely

For internet-native individuals without a finance or software engineering background, several tips were offered for safe engagement in crypto:
1.  **Get a Hardware Wallet**: Essential for securely storing crypto. Trezor or Lattice are recommended over Ledger due to recent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
2.  **Get Active on [[crypto_twitter | Crypto Twitter]]**: It's a vast source of information, but it's best to navigate it with a group of friends to ask questions and discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>.
3.  **Set up a Coinbase Account**: Provides an easy onboarding mechanism with tutorials for new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
4.  **Start with Small Investments**: Begin by buying a small amount of crypto and experimenting with applications like Drip House (for free NFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a> or DeFi apps like MarginFi (for lending/borrowing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.
5.  **Form a Group**: Having a crew of friends interested in crypto makes the learning process more enjoyable and collaborative, providing a support system for exploring opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.

Podcasts from Blockworks and others are also recommended for learning directly from founders about their projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. The overall sentiment is that the [[the_rise_of_social_media_and_influencer_markets | increasing time people spend online]] and the prevalence of remote work naturally align with increased crypto adoption and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

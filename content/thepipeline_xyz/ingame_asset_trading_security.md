The trading of in-game assets has long been a feature of the gaming world, often involving significant value, but it has historically been plagued by security vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Traditional In-Game Trading Practices

Examples of prevalent in-game asset trading include:
*   **CS:GO Skins** Gamers frequently trade skins for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **RuneScape Gold** A "gray market" for RuneScape gold has existed for over 15 years, facilitating the exchange of in-game currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Security Issues in Traditional Trading

Despite the long-standing nature of these markets, users often face significant risks:
*   **Scams** Players engaging in these trades are frequently "getting scammed left and right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Insecure Payment Methods** Transactions often involve insecure methods like wire transferring funds to unknown individuals, which is a less secure process compared to [[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The traditional methods are described as "much less secure than crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Potential for Enhanced Security with Crypto

The inherent security features of [[onchain_gaming | onchain]] components and [[blockchain_gaming_and_nfts | NFTs]] offer a more secure framework for asset tracking and trading within games compared to traditional, less secure gray markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The ideal approach for [[gaming_and_crypto_integration | integrating crypto]] into games involves first creating a fun and engaging game, and then selectively putting components of it [[onchain_gaming | on-chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

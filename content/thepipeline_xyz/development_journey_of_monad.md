The initial inspiration to build [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] arose from the founders' extensive background in building high-performance systems and their later experiences within the blockchain space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Background in High-Frequency Trading

James and the speaker met in 2014 while working together on a high-frequency trading team at Jump Trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Their primary role was to build a full trading system from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This involved processing vast amounts of data packets from exchanges, making rapid trading decisions, and sending orders back out to the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The high-frequency trading environment is intensely competitive, where the speed of decision-making and order execution directly determines success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This competitive pressure necessitated continuous iterations of system improvement, focusing on shaving off latency and building exceptionally performant systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Transition to Crypto and Identifying a Need

Fast forward to 2021, James and the rest of their team transitioned to the crypto team at Jump, immediately engaging with DeFi projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. James, in particular, spent about six months working on Solana DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

During this period, they recognized a significant demand for more performant blockchains in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Crucially, they identified a particular need for a more performant Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. They observed that existing EVM implementations were inefficient and had not been optimized to the same rigorous level as the trading systems they previously built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The Genesis of Monad

The founders realized their background in building highly performant systems from the ground up was perfectly suited to tackle the challenges of optimizing EVM performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. They understood that achieving these optimizations would be a long-term endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The initial inspiration for [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] was thus a blend of their prior experience in creating performant systems for a different domain and their direct interaction with Solana and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Witnessing the performance differences and recognizing the substantial optimization potential within the EVM space ultimately led to the inception of [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

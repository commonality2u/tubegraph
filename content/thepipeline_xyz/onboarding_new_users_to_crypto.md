Onboarding new users to the cryptocurrency space is a critical and evolving challenge, with user experience (UX) and security being paramount. Phantom, a widely used crypto application, is aiming to streamline this process, particularly with its day-one support for Monad's testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Phantom's Approach to User Onboarding

Phantom has had access to the private Monad testnet for several weeks, preparing for launch day to provide a custom-built experience for the Monad community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The integration aims for a fast, super clean experience without the need for network switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Phantom emerged as a leading product for [[advanced_mechanisms_in_blockchain_onboarding | onboarding new users to crypto]], akin to its impact on Solana in 2021 where it was a "game changer" and often users' first wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It set a standard for smooth and thoughtful UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Key aspects of its early UX design included managing multiple wallets cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, hiding spam tokens and NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, and adapting to environments with much cheaper gas fees, which can lead to new types of attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

The Monad team views Phantom's day-one integration as "quite special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> because it enables a smooth experience for many users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The Monad chain's speed and low gas fees, reminiscent of early Solana, align well with Phantom's UX focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Challenges in User Onboarding and Retention

A significant challenge in crypto onboarding is the "last mile" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. New users face a steep learning curve, needing to understand concepts like seed phrases and private keys, and how to back them up securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This difficulty can make or break the onboarding process for non-crypto-native individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Beyond initial onboarding, [[user_experience_and_retention_in_crypto_wallets | user retention]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Wallets must not only onboard users but also keep them engaged and retain them within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This involves:
*   Protecting users and ensuring their [[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | safety]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   Preventing unintended actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   Providing general education and customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

The launch of a new environment like Monad presents a huge opportunity to onboard many new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The goal is to provide enough value to users so they keep returning day after day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, ensuring their journey on Monad is special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Innovations in User Onboarding

Phantom addresses the challenge of onboarding new users by continually innovating. The team made a strategic bet on Solana early on, which fostered a "paranoid survive" mentality, driving continuous improvement and shipping new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This includes adapting quickly to market trends, such as the rise of meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, and developing features like a trending page for tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

Phantom's approach prioritizes net-new, mainstream users, packaging the best of the ecosystem in a palatable way for those accustomed to platforms like Robinhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

Key innovations include:
*   **[[advanced_mechanisms_in_blockchain_onboarding | Social Login]]**: New users can onboard using Google or Apple ID with a four-digit PIN, simplifying the process and reducing friction associated with seed phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This has led to a tremendous uptick in its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **User-Driven Discovery**: The trending token page is based on aggregate user activity, helping users discover what others are engaging with, especially in fast-moving metas like meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.
*   **Mobile-First Experience**: Recognizing that Ethereum L1 and L2s can be cumbersome on mobile, platforms like Monad aim for a fast, snappy experience essential for mobile users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

## The Future of User Experience in Crypto

The future of crypto UX is seen as increasingly mobile-oriented and mobile-first, driven by fast and cheap infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. While a multi-chain world is anticipated, it will likely consist of only a handful of significant ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. The concept of a "chain-specific wallet" is expected to fade, similar to how there are no chain-specific centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.

Wallets will need to abstract the complexities of crypto without losing its core characteristics (like seed phrases and self-custody), while also integrating features like easy cash in/out and social functionalities (e.g., usernames for finding friends) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. The goal is to build a "crypto unique concept of a social network" rather than just a Web2 clone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.

A major unsolved problem is "discovery" in crypto, akin to a Web3 Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Google is uninformative for crypto-specific searches due to SEO, ads, and lack of wallet awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. Bringing together fragmented discovery methods (DEX screeners, CoinMarketCap, Telegram groups) into one platform like Phantom could significantly aid [[user_and_developer_acquisition_in_the_blockchain_ecosystem | user acquisition]] and onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.

## Advice for New Users

For those looking to enter or learn more about the crypto space, several pieces of [[advice_for_crypto_founders | advice for crypto founders]] and users are offered:

*   **Download Phantom**: It provides an easy starting point with social login and a "Discover" tab featuring trending topics and a "Learn Center," including articles like "Monad 101" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.
*   **Be an Explorer**: Crypto rewards those who tinker and keep an open mind, exploring the fringes of the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.
*   **Buy First, Research Later**: For major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana, having "skin in the game" after a purchase can motivate more effective learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. (Note: This advice may need adjustment for meme coins, where some research is recommended first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.)
*   **Join a Community**: Engaging with a group of like-minded individuals makes the journey less frustrating and helps with motivation and navigating highs and lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. This aligns with [[the_strategic_approach_to_engaging_with_a_crypto_community | the strategic approach to engaging with a crypto community]].
*   **Just Do Things**: For those on the sidelines or looking to break into the industry, pick a niche, develop a skill, and start building or creating content. Putting your name behind your work can be very impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   **Take More Risks**: Humans often over-index on potential downside. In general, taking calculated risks and putting oneself out there is encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>, which also relates to [[navigating_risk_and_security_in_crypto_investments | navigating risk and security in crypto investments]].
*   **Focus on Metrics and Consistency**: Measure progress with clear metrics (KPIs) to maintain motivation and drive. This applies to individuals and [[startups_in_crypto | companies]] alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

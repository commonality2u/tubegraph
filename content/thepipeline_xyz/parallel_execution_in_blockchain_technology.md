[[Asynchronous and Parallel Execution in Blockchain Technology | Parallelization]] is a concept gaining traction in new blockchain Layer 1 developments, with Monad being an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, [[Asynchronous and Parallel Execution in Blockchain Technology | parallel execution]] alone is not sufficient for significant [[Performance and scalability of blockchain systems | performance]] improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Monad's Approach to Performance

Monad's development focuses on a comprehensive approach beyond just [[Asynchronous and Parallel Execution in Blockchain Technology | parallel execution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The development team rewrote the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stack from scratch using C++ and Rust to extract more performance from existing hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. [[Asynchronous and Parallel Execution in Blockchain Technology | Parallel compatibility]] is just one element within this broader strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Goals and Capabilities

The primary objective for Monad is to enable High Fidelity DeFi and consumer-facing applications that cannot currently scale in other blockchain environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Current Blockchain Limitations
*   On-chain Central Limit Order Books require 50 to 100 times the performance of an Automated Market Maker (AMM), which is typically unachievable due to low throughput and high gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Applications with small average transactions often price out users due to high gas fees, even on Layer 2 (L2) solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   All L2s combined currently share approximately 750 Transactions Per Second (TPS) without increasing the gas limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Monad's Proposed Solution
Monad aims to achieve 10,000 transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This focus on high throughput is a core reason for Monad launching as a Layer 1 blockchain rather than an L2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Industry Validation and Future Vision

Monad has secured a $225 million Series A funding round from leading investment firms and individuals in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This backing highlights the recognized [[need for performant blockchains | need for performant infrastructure]] that can scale applications, including gaming, consumer applications, social platforms, sports betting, DePIN, and Real World Assets (RWA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The vision is for applications in two to three years to require performant infrastructure to both run and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Monad seeks to enable new use cases in crypto while maintaining alignment with the fundamental values of decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

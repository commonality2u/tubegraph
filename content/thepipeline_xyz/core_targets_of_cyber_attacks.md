Attackers typically target three core things during cyber attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Funds

The primary target for attackers is often an individual's funds, including anything stored on-chain, on exchanges (CEXes), or in wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Access

Attackers seek access to use an individual as an "interception point" to reach others around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This can include colleagues, friends, family, or anyone within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For public figures, gaining access to their account could allow attackers to leverage that access in a [[phishing_and_social_engineering | spear fishing campaign]] to target others, such as by sending malicious meeting invitations or similar fraudulent communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Data

Sensitive credentials and other data are also key targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Any location where sensitive credentials are stored must be rigorously audited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Mitigation Strategies

To protect against these attacks, it is crucial to understand all potential points of failure in one's digital life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This involves inventorying assets and vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, and beginning to [[creating_an_attack_surface_map | create an attack surface map]] to identify all areas of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Once identified, these issues can be tweaked and mitigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

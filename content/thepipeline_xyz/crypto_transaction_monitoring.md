Crypto transaction monitoring refers to the practice where malicious actors observe blockchain transactions to identify potential victims for scams, such as [[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | address poisoning attacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Address Poisoning Attacks

An [[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | address poisoning attack]] occurs when an attacker monitors a user's transaction ledger, like EtherScan, after an incoming transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The attacker then sends a small transaction to the victim, using an address that closely mimics a legitimate one the victim frequently uses, such as their own wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### How the Attack Works
The attacker creates a crypto address that looks very similar to a target's legitimate address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. They achieve this by making the first and last characters of the fraudulent address nearly identical to the legitimate one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This is effective because, in certain browser views or interfaces, the middle characters of an address might not be fully displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### User Vulnerability
If a user is not paying close attention, they might inadvertently copy the poisoned address from their transaction history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Believing it to be the correct wallet they intended to send funds to—perhaps even one of their own wallets—they might accidentally send a large sum of money to the attacker's address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This type of attack has resulted in individuals losing significant amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Prevention
To mitigate the risk of [[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | address poisoning attacks]], users should always:
*   Be aware of this type of scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   [[verifying_crypto_transaction_addresses | Verify crypto transaction addresses]] by using the direct source from where the address was copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   If copying an address from one's own wallet, thoroughly [[verifying_crypto_transaction_addresses | verify]] that it is the exact address intended for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

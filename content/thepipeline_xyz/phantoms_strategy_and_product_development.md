Phantom, one of the most widely used applications in crypto, has a clear strategy focused on user experience, adaptability, and long-term retention. The team behind Phantom has been actively involved with the private Monad testnet for weeks, preparing for launch day to offer a custom-built experience for the Monad community [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## User Experience and Onboarding
Phantom's approach prioritizes a smooth and thoughtful user experience (UX) to onboard new users to crypto [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Keon Han notes that Phantom set a standard for smooth UX, allowing users to manage multiple wallets cleanly and effectively hiding spam tokens and NFTs [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This focus is crucial, especially in environments where gas fees are cheaper, which can make certain attacks, like spamming, more feasible [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

Phantom aims to abstract away the complexities of crypto, making the experience fast and clean without requiring users to switch networks [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. A significant development in this area is the introduction of social login, allowing new users to onboard using their Google or Apple ID with a four-digit PIN, which has seen a "tremendous uptick" in adoption [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This addresses the challenge of seed phrases, which new users "don't necessarily care or have time to learn" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

### Key UX Elements:
*   **Fast and Clean Experience**: Designed to be intuitive and quick for users [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Spam Protection**: Efforts to hide spam tokens and NFTs improve user safety and reduce clutter [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **User Safety**: Beyond onboarding, the wallet focuses on protecting users and preventing unintended actions [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
*   **Education and Support**: Providing general education and customer support are seen as "make or break" elements for adoption [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

## Product Development Philosophy
Phantom's product development is guided by several core principles:

*   **Adaptability to Dynamic Crypto Landscape**: The team acknowledges crypto's "ever-changing Alpha seeking game" with evolving "metas" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[01:14:40]</a>. Their strategy involves building "primitives first" that can be transferred across different trends [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[01:15:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Needs and Continuous Shipping**: Despite being a market leader, Phantom maintains an "only the paranoid survive mentality," continuously shipping and improving value by solving current user needs [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[01:16:18]</a>. This became part of the company's DNA, preventing complacency [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[01:16:41]</a>.
*   **Pragmatism and Engineering Focus**: Phantom was drawn to Solana due to its "pragmatism" and "engineering focused" culture, a DNA they also see in Monad [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[01:17:22]</a>.
*   **Metric and Goal-Oriented**: The team uses metrics and goals to guide development, enabling quick experimentation and learning from new features [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[01:31:53]</a>.

### Feature Prioritization and User Personas
Phantom generally prioritizes "net new users" and mainstream users, aiming to make crypto palatable for those who might otherwise use platforms like Robinhood [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[01:21:57]</a>. While balancing the needs of power users, they strive to package the best of the ecosystem in a way that's appropriate for a broader audience [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[01:22:45]</a>.

When considering new features, Phantom focuses on "jobs to be done" â€“ understanding what users "hire" the product for, such as viewing balances, sending/receiving funds, and discovery [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[01:29:16]</a>. The trending token page, for example, leverages aggregate user activity to help users discover new tokens, showcasing a "bit of alpha that's really fun to work with" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:46:00">[01:23:46]</a>. They aim to leverage their user base to improve the overall experience for everyone [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[01:30:19]</a>.

## Retention and the "Last Mile"
Beyond initial onboarding, Phantom considers retention to be a significant challenge. The goal is to keep users engaged daily, making crypto a part of their everyday life [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27:00">[01:27:27]</a>. This includes protecting users and adapting to new environments where factors like cheaper gas fees introduce new considerations, such as managing spam NFTs from scammers [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[01:03:43]</a>.

## Future Vision
Phantom envisions a future where crypto user experience is:
*   **Mobile-First**: The industry is moving "more and more mobile," requiring quick and snappy interactions [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[01:32:53]</a>.
*   **Multi-Chain, Consolidated Wallets**: While believing in a multi-chain world, they expect only a "few handful of ecosystems" to truly matter, and the idea of "chain specific wallets" will "fall by the wayside" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14:00">[01:33:14]</a>.
*   **Abstracted but Authentic**: Wallets will abstract crypto complexities while retaining core features like seed phrases and full Ethereum provider methods, not creating an "alternate world" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[01:34:17]</a>.
*   **Social Integration**: Social features will be crucial, enabling users to find friends and interact using familiar usernames, building a "very crypto unique concept of a social network" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[01:35:03]</a>.
*   **Improved Discovery**: There's a significant opportunity for a "crypto specific search engine" or integrated discovery tools within wallets, as current options like Google are "uninformative" for crypto-native searches [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:54:00">[01:51:54]</a>.

## Integration with Monad
Phantom is committed to supporting Monad from day one, including a custom-built experience for the Monad community [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. They have had [[integration of_phantom_with_monad_testnet | access to the private Monad testnet]] for several weeks, confirming the chain's speed and working to seamlessly integrate it into the existing Phantom experience [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. The team views Monad as a perfect match due to its fast, snappy performance, reminiscent of early Solana, and its "composable L1" characteristics that foster collaboration [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This [[phantoms_support_for_monad_from_day_one | support for Monad from day one]] is seen as special, mirroring how Phantom was a "game changer for Solana" in 2021 [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

## Advice for New Users
For those curious about crypto, Phantom recommends downloading their app, which offers a "Discover tab" with trending content and a deep "learn Center" that includes a "Monad 101" guide [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[01:47:11]</a>. They advise keeping an open mind and exploring the fringes of the tech, as crypto has historically "rewarded the explorers" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[01:48:03]</a>. The community aspect is also highly valued, as engaging with a group of like-minded individuals makes the learning journey easier and more motivating [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[01:55:17]</a>.

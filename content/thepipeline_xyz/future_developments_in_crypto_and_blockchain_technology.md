The future of [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | crypto and blockchain technology]] is poised for significant expansion, driven by advancements in infrastructure, increased on-chain activity, and the emergence of new use cases. Discussions with Switchboard co-founders Chris and Mitch reveal insights into the evolving landscape, the importance of adaptable oracle solutions, and key trends that could shape the industry over the next several years.

## Enabling New Use Cases with High-Performance Blockchains

A core belief driving current developments is the need for [[technology_advancements_and_infrastructure_in_blockchain | high-performance Layer 1 (L1) blockchains]] and cheaper chains to enable new applications previously unfeasible due to high transaction fees and slow processing speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This vision suggests a future where "everything eventually will be tradeable on DEXs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, a perspective that was controversial even in 2018-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

High-performance EVM ecosystems, like Monad, are seen as crucial for unlocking these new use cases because they address the economic barriers of high transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. The ability to handle transactions at scale with lower costs opens doors for applications that simply didn't make sense on older, more expensive chains like Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

## The Role of Oracles in Future Crypto Applications

Oracles are fundamental to expanding the utility of blockchain beyond traditional DeFi, enabling a more transparent and flexible data landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.

### Customizable and On-Demand Data
A key differentiator for future data needs is the shift towards on-demand data, where users can create data feeds with minimal setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. This contrasts with static, less flexible data providers prevalent in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. The ability to pull, transform, and combine data streams on demand allows for the rapid listing of new assets and the creation of new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:07]</a>.

### Ephemeral Markets
This flexibility supports "ephemeral markets" â€“ short-lived or highly specific markets that wouldn't be economical for larger, more static data providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. Examples include data feeds for games lasting only a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a> or creating new indices for "meme coins of the day" instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. This capability could drive the next wave of DeFi derivatives and lending protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.

### Secure Randomness
Beyond price feeds, there has been unexpected growth in "game-fi" or "gam-fi" applications that require secure randomness, suggesting a [[future_trends_in_crypto_including_social_media_and_gaming | future of crypto applications and use cases]] for non-financial dApps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.

## Emergent Verticals and High-Conviction Areas

Several verticals are expected to see significant growth and innovation in the coming years:

*   **Real-World Assets (RWAs)**: This narrative, though long-standing, is gaining significant traction, with examples like Ondo and Athena showing rapid growth and adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>. The challenge lies in securely bringing off-chain collateral on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>, potentially even including new forms of wrapped Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>.
*   **Interest-Bearing Stablecoins**: These are highlighted as having "proven product-market fit" and offering an "objectively better" experience for payments and end-users compared to Web2 rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>. The stablecoin market is over $100 billion and has significant room to grow as more payments move onto crypto rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. Their success is strongly tied to [[future_potential_and_scalability_in_the_crypto_space | performant, highly scalable blockchains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>.
*   **E-commerce and Non-DeFi Use Cases**: To bring the "next billion people on-chain," products that appeal to a broader audience beyond DeFi are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>. Examples include seamless e-commerce, such as Shopify integrations with USDC and stablecoins, enabling commerce in jurisdictions with difficult payment rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Social Media**: Platforms like Farcaster demonstrate the potential of decentralized social applications as a significant consumer-facing use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>.

## Broader Crypto and Blockchain Predictions

The [[future of the crypto industry and interoperability | future of the crypto industry]] is anticipated to experience massive growth:

*   **100x On-Chain Activity**: It's predicted that on-chain activity will increase 100x over the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>. This explosion will drive massive demand for bringing real-world data on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.
*   **Scalable Oracle Solutions**: To support this growth, a permissionless and customizable oracle offering is crucial, as a "BD team person every single time you want to create a data feed" is not a scalable model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Market Expansion**: The growth of stablecoin TVL from $100 billion to potentially $500 billion would significantly impact the entire crypto ecosystem by increasing payment activity, volume, and collateral flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>.
*   **Infinite Blockchain Throughput**: A more theoretical [[evolution_and_impact_of_highperformance_blockchain_technology | future potential use cases for crypto and blockchain]] prediction involves a consensus model where nodes store history and consensus for individual dApps. Cross-program connections would build consensus for sub-maps of the network, potentially leading to infinite blockchain throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:00">[39:41:00]</a>.

## Challenges in On-Chain Data Management

Managing real-world data on-chain presents unique challenges due to the transparent nature of blockchain:

*   **Data Freshness and Visibility**: Awareness of data freshness and who can access it first is critical to prevent front-running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[35:52:00]</a>.
*   **Security and Consensus**: Achieving efficient and concise consensus for complex data, like tables of events, while maintaining trustless security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>. Methods like ZK verification and hardware verification offer solutions, but balance gas efficiency and fidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>.
*   **Lock Contention in Parallel Blockchains**: On high-speed, parallelized blockchains, managing "read-write locking" of storage blobs is essential to fully leverage the speed advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:59:00">[27:59:00]</a>. Developers must consider lock contention and structure applications accordingly to maximize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.

## Optimizing for Performance

The development of applications on high-performance chains like Monad will see two types of builders:

1.  **Copy-Pasters**: Those who fork existing applications, expecting significant performance gains (e.g., 100x) just by running them on a faster chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>.
2.  **Deep Optimizers**: Those who deeply understand the underlying innovations, such as asynchronous read/write to the custom state database. These builders can achieve "1000x" performance by optimizing at the state database level, providing a noticeable difference for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[crypto_and_blockchain_influences | crypto industry]] is in a period of rapid evolution, moving towards a future with vastly expanded on-chain activity, diverse applications, and more efficient infrastructure. The core thesis for participants is to "have conviction and holding through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:44:00">[42:44:00]</a>, adapting to market changes while staying true to the fundamental beliefs that drive the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:59:00">[42:59:00]</a>. This continued building, even through challenging times, is seen as crucial for the industry's success and expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:00">[42:48:00]</a>.

From: [[thepipeline_xyz]] <br/> 

Circle, a major issuer of stablecoins, will be deploying on [[monad_blockchain_and_usdc_integration | Monad]] mainnet, bringing native USDC, Circle Wallets, CCTP v2, and more to the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This announcement is a significant [[developments_in_the_monad_ecosystem | development]] for [[monad_blockchain_and_usdc_integration | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Impact on DeFi and User Experience
Having native USDC on [[monad_blockchain_and_usdc_integration | Monad]] is a "huge unlock" for DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It addresses a common fragmentation problem seen with multiple versions of USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The integration means Circle, a trusted fiat-backed stablecoin issuer, will be live from day one of [[monad_blockchain_and_usdc_integration | Monad]] Mainnet, ensuring the DeFi and broader [[developments_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad ecosystem]] starts with "all jets firing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

For a casual on-chain explorer, the difference in user experience (UX) between native USDC and fragmented versions is substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Analogy for Native vs. Bridged USDC
Having native USDC is comparable to using real dollar bills issued by the government in a marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. If native USDC were not available, and only wrapped versions existed, it would be like everyone trading coupons that say "I owe you $1 bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. While the marketplace might agree these coupons equal a dollar, using them elsewhere would require going back to the issuer to exchange them for a real dollar before transacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Native USDC makes transactions much easier and helps reduce DeFi fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## Technical Aspects
The announcement signifies several [[technical_aspects_of_natively_issuing_usdc_on_monad | technical aspects of natively issuing USDC on Monad]]:

### Native USDC Issuance
Native USDC issuance means Circle has a smart contract directly deployed on the [[monad_blockchain_and_usdc_integration | Monad]] blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This allows users to deposit dollars at Circle and directly mint USDC on-chain within that smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The creation and redemption mechanism for USDC will happen on-chain on [[monad_blockchain_and_usdc_integration | Monad]] from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This means any USDC acquired on [[monad_blockchain_and_usdc_integration | Monad]] will be directly issued by Circle through its smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Contrast with Bridged USDC
If a chain does not have native USDC, the tokens are typically issued on another blockchain (like Ethereum) and then sent over a bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The version of USDC traded on such a chain is merely a claim token over the original bridged asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. To redeem it back at Circle, it would first need to be sent back over the bridge to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

This native integration avoids the fragmentation problem seen in other new ecosystems, such as Avalanche or Arbitrum, where USDC was not native from day one, leading to confusing bridged versions and requiring subsequent conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### CCTP v2 Integration
Circle is also bringing CCTP v2 (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol) to [[monad_blockchain_and_usdc_integration | Monad]] Mainnet from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This mechanism allows users to transport USDC from one chain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Base) to [[monad_blockchain_and_usdc_integration | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Users can effectively "turn in" their USDC on a source chain and have it reissued natively on [[monad_blockchain_and_usdc_integration | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This ensures that the official, Circle-issued version of USDC is available, eliminating fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Dan Matuszewski, co-founder of CMS Holdings, shares insights from his extensive experience in the cryptocurrency market, covering its evolution, trading strategies, and key advice for participants. CMS Holdings is a VC firm specializing in financial services, big data, fintech, and particularly blockchain and cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Early Engagement and Market Evolution

Dan's journey into crypto began in late 2012 and early 2013, while working at a hedge fund with Julian, the "S" in CMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Bitcoin was then known in the trading community but was still primarily pitched as a payments system, with companies like BitPay being prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The "store of value" narrative was present but not dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

He started engaging in [[Market making in crypto vs traditional finance | automated trading]] on exchanges like Mount Gox, which dominated about 80% of the volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The market was inefficient, with small aggregate trading volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Many early exchanges, including Bitfloor and some in Canada, blew up due to hacks or banking issues, leading up to the major collapse of Mount Gox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

The period from 2014 to 2015 saw a significant lull in the market. Total aggregate trading volume on the top exchange, Bitfinex, was less than a million dollars per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This quiet period led some companies, like Circle, to move away from crypto at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

The market shifted significantly with the rise of Ethereum (Eth) and the ICO boom around 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Before this, companies like Circle only traded Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Eth's popularity made it impossible to keep up with all the information, and other assets became crucial to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This marked a horizontal growth, where the industry broadened, and tracking all information became impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## Current Market Dynamics and [[Cryptocurrency market trends and predictions | Hot Takes]]

Dan believes that current narratives about one blockchain fixing another's problems are "bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. He attributes recent asset performance to their inherent beta, meaning assets that suffered more in the bear market have rebounded faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. This is seen as typical bull market behavior rather than a new regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

A continuing challenge in the market is the lack of clear visibility between Asian and Western trading sessions, which can lead to information asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### The Bitcoin ETF

Dan views the Bitcoin ETF as "big" due to the potential for passive capital flows from traditional finance products like equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. It opens up a new pool of buyers who were previously unable or slowed down from owning the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

However, he cautions against extrapolating too much from the initial inflows in the first few weeks, as it takes time for RAs and other funds to integrate such products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. He sees it as a "long tail boom" for the asset class, bringing additional passive money into the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. The competition among providers for AUM will lead to significant advertising, providing valuable "non-sketchy" exposure for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

For future ETFs, Dan predicts a cadence where CME futures trade for a year or two before an ETF is approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. He estimates a 75-80% probability of an Eth ETF within a year if the Bitcoin ETF performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, but he is skeptical about ETFs for other altcoins like Solana in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. The Eth ETF will be complicated due to staking considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

## Institutional Adoption

Institutions view crypto as an "uncorrelated asset" with "Alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. For large asset managers aiming to beat benchmarks like the S&P 500, adding uncorrelated sources of alpha like Bitcoin is appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. It can be shoehorned as a minority position into existing fixed income and equities portfolios, adding performance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

## [[Crypto trading strategies and personal experiences | Trading Experiences]]

Dan identifies the COVID-19 crash as the "craziest period of trading" he's ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. During this time, Bitfinex experienced issues, and FTX stopped working on the lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. Eth basis went to extreme levels, moving Â±20% in half an hour relative to the underlying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. Counterparty risk was immense, with no clear idea who was solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

Another "weirdest period" was the 48 hours after FTX was effectively shut down, where CMS tried to strategically lose money in their FTX account to gain it elsewhere, as a way to extract funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

## Trading Philosophy

Dan highlights two important trading tropes:

1.  **"Hot Ball of Money"**: This concept, often used for the Chinese market, describes how capital moves dynamically from one asset class to another (e.g., equities to real estate to commodities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. In crypto, this is evident in how capital flows after Bitcoin and Eth rip, then disperse into other corners of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>. The challenge is identifying what matters in each cycle, as this changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.
2.  **"Do you want to make money or do you want to be right?"**: This emphasizes not fighting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. Even if fundamentals suggest something is wrong, the market might act irrationally, and attempting to short it can lead to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.

## Key [[Crypto trading strategies and personal experiences | Trading Advice]]

### Cut the Leverage
Dan strongly advises against using excessive leverage, especially for young traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. He recounts how CMS was negatively impacted by lenders failing in 2022, forcing them to unwind positions at disadvantageous levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>. The second and third-order effects of leverage in markets are often unclear, and the failure of one lender can cascade across the entire ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>. While stories of people making it big on leverage circulate, hundreds or thousands are carried out, creating a selection bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>.

### Trade Less
Dan's second piece of advice is to "trade less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. If one has a thesis, it's often better to hold rather than constantly trade. He reflects on past experiences where simply holding assets like Eth would have been easier and less stressful than active trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. Many people in the industry tend to overtrade, undoing their own correct decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

## Reflections on Monad (Parallel EVM)

Regarding Monad, a project generating significant interest for its parallel EVM narrative, Dan notes the high level of community interest, with most views being positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. However, there's skepticism, particularly from Solana users who view it as a potential threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>. He mentions that highly technical people tend to be the most skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. He draws a parallel to the launch of Eth, where Bitcoin developers were initially dismissive, and later Eth developers doubted Solana's scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. He suggests that advancements sometimes require "a new crop of people" and time to be accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

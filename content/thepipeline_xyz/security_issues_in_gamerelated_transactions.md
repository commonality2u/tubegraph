## Traditional Gaming Market Vulnerabilities

In traditional gaming environments, gray markets for in-game [[asset_tracking_and_trading_in_games | assets]] and currencies present significant security risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Examples include:

*   **CS:GO Skins Trading** Gamers trading skins for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **RuneScape Gold Gray Market** An established gray market for RuneScape gold has existed for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Users engaging in these markets frequently experience scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Transactions in these gray markets often involve insecure methods, such as wire transferring funds to anonymous individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These traditional transaction methods are considered much less [[security_concerns_and_solutions_in_blockchain_ecosystems | secure]] compared to [[crypto_security_challenges | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

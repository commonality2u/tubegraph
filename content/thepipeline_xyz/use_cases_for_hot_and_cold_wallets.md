There are two primary types of cryptocurrency wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets, each with distinct characteristics and use cases. The fundamental [[difference_between_hot_and_cold_wallets | difference between them]] lies in their connection to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For a comprehensive overview, see [[cold_wallets_vs_hot_wallets_what_users_should_know | Cold Wallets vs Hot Wallets What Users Should Know]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Cold Wallets

A cold wallet is a method of storing funds where the private keys are kept offline, meaning they are not connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This concept is often referred to as "cold storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Security and Advantages
Cold wallets are considered far more secure because hackers cannot gain access to your private keys unless specific mistakes are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They are significantly less likely to be compromised compared to hot wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This high level of [[security_features_of_cold_wallets | security]] is their main advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Use Cases
*   **Long-Term Storage:** Due to their enhanced security, cold wallets are ideal for storing larger amounts of cryptocurrency for long periods.
*   **Primary Trading Wallet:** It is strongly recommended to conduct all trading activities using a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Disadvantages and Best Practices
While highly secure, cold wallets do involve some friction and require extra steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Backup:** Users must always back up their recovery phrase or keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Offline Storage:** To maintain [[best_practices_for_cold_wallet_storage | security]], these recovery phrases should never be put online, as doing so would defeat the purpose of a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Physical Security:** Store recovery phrases in a safe, known location, ideally on a piece of paper in a fireproof place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Hot Wallets

A hot wallet is characterized by its constant connection to the internet, making it "live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Ease of Use and Advantages
The primary advantage of a hot wallet is its user-friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Its internet connectivity allows for seamless and quick transactions. See [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_hot_wallets | Advantages and disadvantages of hot wallets]] for more details.

### Use Cases
*   **Quick Transactions:** Hot wallets are commonly used by traders who need to quickly move funds on-chain or off-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Small, Frequent Transactions:** They are suitable for holding small amounts of cryptocurrency that are actively used for daily transactions or trading.

### Security Risks and Disadvantages
The main drawback of hot wallets is their inherent [[security_risks_of_hot_wallets | security risk]] due to being constantly online. Users are much more likely to be compromised on a hot wallet than a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial never to keep too much cryptocurrency in a hot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Axelar is an [[interoperability and blockchain communication | interoperability]] network structured as a blockchain that connects various other blockchains, currently supporting 56 and counting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:19">[03:30:19]</a>. It functions as a messaging platform upon which developers can build applications, rather than being a bridge itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:30">[04:30:30]</a>. These applications can range from cross-chain decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to money markets and NFT marketplaces, spanning across different blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:01">[04:42:01]</a>.

## Founding and Inspiration
Axelar was co-founded by Georgios Vlachos and Sergey Gorbunov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Both met at MIT and were part of the founding team of the Algorand blockchain, which aimed to be faster than Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. Georgios's inspiration for entering the blockchain space came from the financial crisis in Greece, where it was difficult to send remittances or access bank funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. The idea of a censorship-resistant financial system resonated with him, where anyone could seamlessly transact from a cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>.

At Algorand, Georgios designed the consensus protocol, while Sergey led the standardization of BLS signatures, now a core signature scheme securing Ethereum 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:21">[02:01:21]</a>. Their combined experience in building secure infrastructure spans about seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.

The impetus for Axelar's design stemmed from the challenges faced when launching Algorand in late 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. It became clear how difficult it was to onboard users and developers due to existing liquidity being on Ethereum and the lack of easy bridging solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. The founders realized that bridging was more than just asset transfers; it was about abstracting away the complexities of Web3 for a better user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:28">[08:35:28]</a>. This led to the creation of a generalizable message passing platform rather than a simple bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

## Key Differentiators and Architecture
Axelar stands out from competitors like Wormhole, Chainlink CCIP, and LayerZero due to two primary differentiators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:47">[05:11:47]</a>:

1.  **Many-to-Many Connectivity**: Axelar's blockchain-based architecture allows for a single connection point to the Axelar blockchain, enabling messages to be routed to any of the other connected blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This contrasts with competitors who typically offer pairwise connectivity, making it harder to add new chains and often limiting connections to a subset of chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
2.  **Decentralization and Security**: Designed using the Cosmos SDK, Axelar has a fully decentralized validator set of 75 validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. To attack the network and steal funds, a majority of these validators would need to be corrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. Axelar's security is comparable to the chains it connects to, and it is considered five times more decentralized than some competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## Developer Experience with General Message Passing (GMP)
For developers building on [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology_advancements | Monad]] who want to allow users from other networks to interact with their applications, Axelar's General Message Passing (GMP) simplifies the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Instead of redeploying on numerous chains, developers can have the core logic of their application on a fast EVM chain like [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.

For instance, a decentralized application (dApp) developer would deploy a small piece of code on an origin chain (e.g., Arbitrum) and connect it to Axelar's endpoint on that chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. This allows direct interaction between users on the origin chain and the dApp's core on [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology | Monad]], abstracting away the bridging step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. Developers can send their first message through Axelar documentation within about 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. This approach centralizes logic on one chain, preventing fragmentation and simplifying development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

## Evolution and Future of Interoperability
The perception of cross-chain development has drastically changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. Previously, teams were content with being on a single chain, but now, launching on multiple chains with plans for more is standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. The rapid shift in liquidity and user bases across chains necessitates a cross-chain building strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.

While many current [[interoperability and blockchain communication | interoperability]] use cases are still focused on asset transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>, this is largely due to the early stage of the industry and high cross-chain gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. As scaling solutions reduce gas costs and chains like [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology | Monad]] offer faster transaction finality, cross-chain transactions will increase exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

Axelar anticipates that every single-chain application will eventually have a cross-chain version, along with entirely new cross-chain use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. One of the most exciting products enabling this [[future of the crypto industry and interoperability | future]] is Axelar's [[interchain_token_services_and_future_use_cases | Interchain Token Service (ITS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.

### Interchain Token Service (ITS)
The [[interchain_token_services_and_future_use_cases | Interchain Token Service]], currently in beta, is a code-free, permissionless tokenization and bridging solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. It allows anyone, from meme coin creators to large projects, to launch a token across multiple chains from day one with the ability to scale to any future chain Axelar supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. An example is the partnership with Frax, which now relies on Axelar to issue Frax assets on chains not supported by their native Frax Ferry bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. This service aligns with the ethos of the space by being fully permissionless, anonymous, and decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>.

## Mitigating Risk in Interoperability
Axelar addresses [[challenges and solutions in blockchain bridging | challenges and solutions in blockchain bridging]] and the risks of interoperability through multiple layers of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>:

1.  **Decentralization**: As a decentralized network, Axelar mitigates the most common attack vector seen in centralized bridges, which have resulted in billions of dollars in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Rate Limiting**: Axelar incorporates rate limiting, a simple code check that minimizes the impact of a hack by limiting the amount of funds that can be moved within a certain time frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:46:00">[23:46:00]</a>. This can be customized on the Axelar blockchain, containing damage even if a connected chain breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Multi-Provider Approval**: For enhanced security, applications can require approval from multiple independent cross-chain solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>. For example, Lido's community voted to work jointly with both Axelar and Wormhole, requiring approval from both validator sets before an asset is minted, creating three layers of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.

## [[Axelars partnership with Monad]]
Axelar publicly committed early support for [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology_advancements | Monad]] due to strong belief in the team and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. The founders of Axelar and [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology | Monad]] (Keone and Eunice) connected approximately two years prior to the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>. The shared MIT connection and the technical founders' clear vision for solving scalability issues were key factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>.

Axelar recognizes [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology | Monad's]] instant finality as crucial for cross-chain applications, significantly improving user experience by reducing message passing times from 15-20 minutes on Ethereum to 60-90 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. The excitement within the community and demand from builders to launch on [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology | Monad]] solidified Axelar's commitment to be available on the chain from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.

## Vision for the [[future_of_the_crypto_industry_and_interoperability | Future of Interoperability]]
Axelar believes that [[interoperability and blockchain communication | interoperability]] is not a single "killer use case" but rather a fundamental layer that will integrate with virtually every application in the space, making Web3 as easy to use as Web2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>. The goal is to abstract away the underlying blockchain complexities from the user, allowing them to focus only on assets and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>. In the future, a wallet might aggregate a user's total balance of an asset across different chains and use [[interoperability and blockchain communication | interoperability]] infrastructure to seamlessly pass messages across networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>. Axelar expects [[interoperability and blockchain communication | interoperability]] to be ubiquitous across DeFi, gaming, real-world asset tokenization, and NFTs within the next four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>.

## Perspectives on the Future of Crypto
In the long term, success in crypto is driven by strong technology and a robust community, rather than fleeting narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:00">[34:33:00]</a>. Projects like [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology | Monad]] exemplify this combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>. It is crucial for individuals and projects to maintain their convictions amidst market noise and hype, especially as the industry heads into future bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:59:00">[35:59:00]</a>.

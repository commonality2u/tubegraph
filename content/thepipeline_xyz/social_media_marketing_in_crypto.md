Within the broader crypto ecosystem, significant opportunities exist, particularly in the realm of social media and marketing. Many perceive this as an area still overlooked by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Opportunities in Eco-Marketing

There is "a ton of opportunity" within ecosystems like Manad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Specifically on the "Eco marketing side," virtually every team [[startups_in_crypto | building on Manad]] is actively seeking assistance with [[the_relationship_between_crypto_and_social_media | social media marketing]] and [[building_and_engaging_community_in_crypto_spaces | community help]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This demand highlights a significant need for skilled individuals in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The opportunities are described as "truly endless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

For instance, a Manad community member recently secured a full-time job working in crypto within a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Hiring for Social Media & Community Roles

When advising on hiring for these positions, two key pieces of advice are often given:
1.  **Hire crypto-native:** Seek individuals already familiar with the broader crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  **Hire ecosystem-native:** For specific projects or ecosystems (e.g., Manad), prioritize individuals deeply embedded in that particular community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

There is a recognized need for individuals who understand and can help drive initiatives from within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This is particularly crucial for projects that aim to [[building_and_engaging_community_in_crypto_spaces | rally their community members]] for specific events or developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

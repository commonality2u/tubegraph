RareBetSports is introducing a new approach to Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) built on the Monad blockchain, aiming to onboard the next billion crypto users through sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:16">[03:15:16]</a>. The company has been developing in stealth, creating excitement and momentum before its public rollout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>.

## Introducing RareBetSports and RareLink

[[introduction_to_rarebetsports | RareBetSports]] is an ecosystem that aims to release several games and products within the sports and crypto vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. Its first product is RareLink, a Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

[[daily_fantasy_sports_and_its_differentiation_from_traditional_sports_betting | Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS)]] differs from traditional sports betting in that it focuses on player statistics and their performance rather than the overall game outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Users predict whether a player's given line will be higher or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This model has gained popularity in the US with companies like PrizePicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a> and is considered easier to onboard less savvy bettors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. It leverages the modern sports landscape where players, such as LeBron James and Patrick Mahomes, are the stars rather than just teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

RareBetSports is built around a legal carve-out in the US that differentiates DFS from traditional sports gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Unlike many existing Web3 sportsbooks that are white-labeled and not proprietary, RareBetSports emphasizes building its own proprietary technology with a Web3-first approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Advantages of Blockchain and Crypto Integration

The decision to build on blockchain, specifically Monad, offers several advantages for [[revolutionizing_sports_betting_with_blockchain | sports betting]]:

*   **Community Focus**: Web2 platforms often lack a community-focused approach. RareBetSports integrates community into its DNA, allowing it to reward various communities on its platform and within the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This includes providing utility to tokens and NFT communities that might be struggling to drive revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
*   **Proprietary Innovation**: Being built with Web3 first enables the team to easily release new features and evolve with the crypto narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.
*   **Seamless Onboarding**: Compared to Web2, onboarding users in Web3 can be more seamless, especially when working with account abstraction companies and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Monad's Performance**: Monad's capabilities, such as 10,000 transactions per second and sub-cent gas fees in an EVM environment, are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. These technical advantages allow RareBetSports to operate without burdening users with high gas fees or long wait times for settlements, essential for a consumer-facing app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.
*   **Access to User Base and Fundraising**: Monad provides a hungry user base interested in fun and engaging applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Being a consumer app on Monad has also been beneficial for fundraising, gaining exposure from those who missed earlier Monad funding rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.
*   **New Betting Opportunities**: Blockchain opens up opportunities for betting on [[gaming_and_crypto_integration | on-chain gaming]] and [[the_integration_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_mobile_gaming | blockchain gaming]], which Web2 companies cannot touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. There's also significant interest in Esports betting, with data feeds already available for games like League of Legends and CS2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>. The recent inclusion of Esports as an official Olympic sport further highlights its growing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.

## [[innovations_in_user_experience_for_betting_platforms | Innovations in User Experience]]

RareBetSports is highly focused on creating a seamless and enjoyable user experience, especially for those new to crypto:

*   **Hiding the Blockchain**: Inspired by NBA Top Shot on Flow, the goal is to hide the underlying blockchain from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. Users should perceive it simply as a fun, consumer-facing app without realizing they are interacting with a blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>.
*   **Account Abstraction**: For Web2 users, RareBetSports plans to use account abstraction tools, allowing logins via platforms like Twitter and Facebook, simplifying the onboarding process significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>.
*   **Minimized "Time to Fun"**: A key focus is to drastically reduce the time it takes for a user to go from downloading the app to having a fun experience, unlike traditional crypto onboarding that can involve many complex steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>.
*   **Swiping UI**: The mobile user interface employs a swiping approach, reminiscent of dating apps like Tinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:01:00">[30:01:00]</a>. This allows users to place a wager with a single swipe, rather than multiple clicks, enhancing ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>. This proprietary design allows them to innovate on the user experience and adapt as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>.

## Strategic Market Fit and Future Outlook

Sports betting and daily fantasy sports have a proven market fit in Web2, and the industry is rapidly evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Sports provide year-round entertainment and opportunities for platforms like RareBetSports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. Gambling also demonstrates "bear resistance," meaning people continue to engage even during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.

The team's mission is to onboard new crypto users through sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. They plan to use free-to-play games available on app stores as a funnel to introduce US users to their Web3 community and convert them into crypto users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.

## [[integrating_social_and_financial_elements_in_cryptocommunities | Community Engagement and Strategy]]

The RareBetSports team comprises crypto natives with extensive experience in prediction markets, DeFi, and NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>. Their firsthand experience as crypto users, including trying various games and understanding what works and what doesn't, directly shaped their product vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. Their background also includes working in Launchpads, incubating and launching various token projects, providing insights into successful and unsuccessful strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a>.

A core philosophy for RareBetSports is to reintroduce the "fun" aspect into crypto, believing that enjoyment and community are as important as monetary gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

The Monad community and broader crypto community can get involved by seeking early access beta program codes, which will be distributed through Discord, Twitter, and various influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>.

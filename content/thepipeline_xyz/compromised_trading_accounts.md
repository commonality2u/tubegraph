Compromised trading accounts often result from sophisticated [[social_engineering_in_trading_groups | social engineering]] tactics designed to trick users into unknowingly giving up access to their digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Attackers are willing to expend significant time, effort, and money, potentially "five figures," to execute such campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Case Study: Trader Y22

A notable trader known as Y22 experienced a significant account compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Y22 had gained considerable attention for consistently posting profitable [[crypto_trading_strategies_and_experiences | trading journal]] entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

### Attack Methodology

The compromise of Y22's account unfolded through several steps:
1.  **Impersonation:** An attacker posted a link to a fake Telegram group under Y22's Twitter thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The attacker's Twitter profile was meticulously designed to mimic Y22's, including their Twitter history, follower count, and a similar username <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The imposter even displayed a gold check mark on their profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
2.  **Forced Verification:** Upon joining the fake Telegram group, users were prompted to undergo a "verification" process involving extra steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
3.  **Cross-Device Action:** The verification process specifically instructed users to perform an action on their desktop browser, steering them away from their mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
4.  **Wallet Compromise:** Performing the requested action on the desktop browser, where hot wallets were located, led to the compromise of Y22's assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. As a result, Y22 "more or less" lost everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

From: [[thepipeline_xyz]] <br/> 

Building a company that generates substantial enterprise value is fundamentally more crucial than simply developing a great product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. While product development is important, it should be viewed as a component of the broader company-building strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## What is Product?

Product development typically encompasses several aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>:
*   **Product Definition** What the product is, what it does, and who its users are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Product Delivery** How requirements are met, and how development velocity is increased to bring the product to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Growth and Marketing** Strategies for product-led growth, growth hacks, and marketing channels to reach the right customer with the right message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Pricing** Often overlooked, but a critical element of the product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

Founders often spend 70% to 80% of their time on these product-focused activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, when the majority of their efforts should be directed towards company building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## What is Company Building (Enterprise Value)?

Company building involves strategic elements that directly contribute to enterprise value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>:
*   **Cash Management** The most critical aspect for any founder, as running out of cash is the primary reason companies fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Fundraising** The ability to articulate a compelling vision to investors to secure necessary capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Brand Awareness** How the company is perceived and recognized in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring** Empowering and bringing on the right individuals to ensure success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Vision** The overarching direction and purpose of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)** Strategic thinking about acquiring or being acquired to enhance enterprise value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

Building a great business is a more challenging but ultimately more rewarding endeavor than solely building a great product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

## Key Principles for Company Building and Enterprise Value

### 1. Picking the Right Co-founder
Choosing a co-founder is arguably the most important decision for a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   **Why a Co-founder?** Building a business is incredibly difficult and often lonely. A co-founder provides mutual support and helps sustain morale during challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   **Complementary Support** An ideal co-founder should possess skills that complement your own, rather than being an exact replica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. This includes diverse attributes like product sense, technical acumen, market analysis, and community management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
*   **Personality and Network** Complementary personalities and networks can significantly enhance the company's strength and reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
*   **[[Early stage founders | Founder-Market Fit]]** For [[growth potential of earlystage projects | early stage projects]], this is a critical factor for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Founders with deep experience in their target market (e.g., DeFi founders with traditional finance or market-maker backgrounds) have an inherent advantage in understanding the market and technical capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Obsession** A co-founder should be equally obsessed with the problem space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:07]</a>. Lack of full commitment is a red flag for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

### 2. Optimizing for a Massive Financial Outcome
When taking on [[Venture capital impact on crypto development | venture capital]], founders must aim for a massive financial outcome, ideally a 100x return for pre-seed investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Dilution** Diluting too much equity too early can make it difficult to attract future significant investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Right Partners over Valuation** Don't be overly concerned about a few percentage points in valuation if it means bringing in the right strategic partners who can enable success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. A small percentage difference in valuation has a negligible impact on a founder's wealth if the company achieves a billion-dollar outcome, but can be significant for investors' returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.

### 3. The Goal of Capital is to Create Enterprise Value
The purpose of raising capital is not merely to build a product, but to create specific forms of enterprise value that enable future fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond Product Milestones** CEOs should focus on driving enterprise value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.
*   **Forms of Enterprise Value**
    *   **Revenue:** The most straightforward and powerful indicator of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Brand Awareness/Category Leadership:** Being recognized as a leader in a specific crypto category, even without significant revenue initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.
    *   **Data:** Accumulating proprietary data that can be monetized in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Partnerships & Distribution Channels:** Strategic alliances or exclusive distribution access that guarantee future revenue potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>.
*   **Margin of Safety** Always raise capital with a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. Market conditions, industry trends, technology, and customer demand can change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.

### 4. Find and Do the One Thing That Matters
A founder's most challenging task is identifying and relentlessly pursuing the single most critical action that ensures company success, while ignoring all other distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Growth/Customers over Features:** For Series A, investors seek customers, growth, AUM, or revenue, not just more features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.
*   **Ship over Tech Debt:** While technical debt is a concern, startups with limited runway cannot afford extensive refactoring if it delays shipping new features and acquiring customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>.
*   **Depth over Breadth:** Avoid trying to do too many things simultaneously. Focus on becoming an expert in one area to achieve [[Product market fit and customer engagement | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.
*   **Alignment and Action:** Align the entire team on this "one thing" and act without over-planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>.

### 5. Hire Slowly, Fire Quickly
The impulse to quickly expand a team after securing capital can be detrimental if not done carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.
*   **Quality over Speed:** Hiring the wrong person can cause more damage than not hiring at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>.
*   **Impact of Bad Hires:** Each hire represents a significant portion of the company's operational capacity, not just a percentage on the cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.
*   **Attracting Talent:** A-players seek environments without "dead weight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.
*   **Decisive Action:** Once a wrong hire is identified, act quickly. Delaying a necessary termination rarely improves the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.

### 6. Get Out of Stealth
Staying in stealth mode for extended periods is a common mistake that significantly increases the risk of irrelevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>.
*   **Learning and Iteration:** Stealth prevents interaction with customers, gathering feedback, and iterative product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>.
*   **Building Momentum:** Without public engagement, there's no opportunity to build excitement or momentum leading up to launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>.
*   **Market Anchor:** Being early and open allows a company to establish itself as the market leader or "anchor" against which others are measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Runway:** Spending precious runway time in stealth means not engaging in value-building activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>.
*   **Successful Examples:** Projects like Monad, Jito/Solana, and Photo Finish successfully built in the open, fostering community engagement and excitement long before mainnet launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>.
*   **Proactive Engagement:** Engage in "plus EV Enterprise Value activities" such as building community, mini-games, or podcasts to maintain engagement and awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:00">[27:18:00]</a>.

## Product Building (Supportive Role for Enterprise Value)

While less important than overall company building, product development remains vital for generating enterprise value.

### 7. Be Relentless About Finding [[Product market fit and customer engagement | Product Market Fit]]
[[Product market fit and customer engagement | Product market fit]] means finding repeatable instances of "hell yes" customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>.
*   **Repeatable Solutions:** The product must serve a market repeatedly, not be custom-built for every single customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Pull:** Instead of pushing the product, customers should be actively pulling it, demonstrating urgent demand and readiness to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>.
*   **Indicators of PMF:**
    *   **Pricing Validation:** Customers continue to use and pay for the product even when prices are introduced or increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>. A common strategy is to "double prices until somebody says no" to discover true price elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:00">[36:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Customer Evangelism:** Users are so satisfied they actively promote the product to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:59:00">[36:59:00]</a>.

### 8. Remember That Customers Lie
Do not directly ask customers what they want, as they may not be able to articulate their true needs, or might give misleading feedback to make conversations easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>.
*   **Observe Behavior and Goals:** Instead, ask customers what they *do* and what they are *trying to accomplish* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:27:00">[38:27:00]</a>. This reveals opportunities to create better experiences and direct paths to their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:00">[38:35:00]</a>.
*   **Product Intuition over Experiments:** For early-stage startups, rapid iteration and decisive action are more important than complex A/B testing, which is better suited for large, established companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>. [[Decisionmaking for crypto founders | Founders]] with strong [[Early stage founders | founder-market fit]] can often intuitively know what needs to be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:00">[39:52:00]</a>.

### 9. Simplicity is More Important Than Complexity
Designing simple, compelling products is much harder and more effective than creating complex ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13:00">[40:13:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Attention:** Modern customer attention spans are short; a product needs to make an immediate impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:33:00">[41:33:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Technical Debt:** Complex products create more technical debt and make maintenance difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:03:00">[42:03:00]</a>.
*   **Clear Value Proposition:** Simplicity clarifies the product's core value proposition, making it easier for customers to understand and onboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:35:00">[42:35:00]</a>.
*   **Indicators of Complexity:**
    *   Inability to describe value proposition in two sentences or 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:13:00">[43:13:13]</a>.
    *   Lack of a "delight moment" for users within 60 seconds of onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>.
    *   Absence of a singular, clear call to action within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:58:00">[43:58:00]</a>.
    *   Constantly adding features without removing any <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:07:00">[44:07:00]</a>.

### 10. Referral Codes Should Include Core Value Proposition
Referral mechanisms should be designed to immediately expose new users to the product's core value, rather than just a generic code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:34:00">[44:34:00]</a>.
*   **Immediate Utility:** For instance, a private crypto Venmo app required new users to receive a payment to onboard. This immediately gave them funds to interact with the app's features (sending, claiming points, interacting with DeFi), unlocking its value proposition from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>.
*   **Compelling Onboarding:** This creates a much more engaging and compelling onboarding experience than simply downloading an app with an empty balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27:00">[46:27:00]</a>.

Ultimately, balancing strategic company building with effective product development is key to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:20:00">[47:20:00]</a>.

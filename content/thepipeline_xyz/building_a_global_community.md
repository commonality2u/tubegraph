Tristan, co-founder at Backpack, highlighted the journey of building a global community around Backpack and Mad Lads, emphasizing the intersection of product, culture, and strategic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of Mad Lads and Backpack Community

The initial inspiration for Mad Lads and the Backpack community stemmed from a desire to build a strong community and create a cohesive group of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This began with a unique, unannounced market entry for X NFTs (decentralized applications runnable in the wallet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

Many individuals in the Solana ecosystem, including figures like Anatoly, Raj, and Armani, changed their Twitter usernames to include "xnf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This created an air of mystery, leading to rapid organic growth on Twitter, with 10,000 followers gained in the first month without paid engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

To channel this energy, a private Discord was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. People were invited based on engaging content, such as good memes or well-written pieces, identifying them as potential contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. A specific GIF of an anime girl throwing a blue dodgeball became a public signal for those selected to join the Discord, leading to a "Cambrian explosion of memes" as others tried to emulate the behavior to gain access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

The resulting community comprised "hardcore, chronically online crypto addicts and meme masters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Building personal connections through extensive hours in the Discord and maintaining dialogue fostered a loyal base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. This engagement also led to the "blue ball meme," symbolizing the mystery around X NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

## Integrating Product and Community: The Mad Lads NFT Collection

A key realization was that focusing solely on product and technology would not be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Drawing an analogy to Bitcoin's success, which wasn't just Satoshi's technological advancement but also the evangelism of early cyberpunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>, it became clear that the intersection of product and culture was vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

To sustain this energy, an NFT collection was launched as the best [[community_building_in_the_web_3_space | community building]] exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. The initial core group from the Discord became the cultural backbone, aligned with the team's vision and ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. This strategy allowed the core members to maintain the community's culture as it grew from 500-600 to over 30,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

The Mad Lads collection also served to showcase the X NFT technology, making it possible for an NFT to also function as an application, providing a depth of experience previously uncommon in the NFT space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

During the Solana bear market, the Backpack wallet was used as a [[building_and_engaging_with_online_communities | community engagement]] tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. Games were integrated into the wallet interface to allow users to win invite codes for beta testing and whitelist spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. Examples included guessing AI-generated image prompts, identifying animal sounds, and navigating a Minecraft map to find hidden codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. This focus on creating shared experiences was crucial for [[community_and_networking_in_blockchain | community building]], fostering genuine care for the project beyond financial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.

## The Backpack Exchange and Global Expansion

The Mad Lads mint was also unique in that all interactions, including whitelist claims and the public mint, were conducted within the Backpack wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. A game to "defeat the Mad King" to unrug the NFTs further engaged users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. This generated significant hype, attracting participants from across the crypto ecosystem, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Cosmos communities, which helped re-blossom the Solana ecosystem during a dire period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>.

The decision to launch the Backpack Exchange came serendipitously when a leading crypto regulatory and licensing expert, met with Armani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>. Recognizing the strong engineering, marketing, and community of Backpack, and the expert's regulatory knowledge, they merged efforts to fill the gap left by FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.

The exchange launched in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>, distinguishing itself as an internationally focused exchange built with full regulatory compliance from day zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>. It was the first to receive a Vara full retail cryptocurrency exchange license in Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>.

The Backpack Exchange was built on first principles, acting as a permissioned blockchain with validators running different instances of the exchange for replayability and potential future regulatory oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:04:00">[26:04:00]</a>. It also incorporates a ZK proof of reserves system, allowing users to verify their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>. The approach combines Coinbase's compliance with Binance's crypto-native agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>.

There is a clear synergy between the non-custodial Backpack wallet (for on-chain activity) and the Backpack Exchange (for off-chain activity), creating a seamless user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:00">[29:38:00]</a>. Mad Lads NFT holders serve as "super fans" and "super users," driving attention and providing valuable feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>.

The team decided to move operations out of the US due to the unfavorable regulatory environment and to align with Asia, seen as the center of crypto activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:00]</a>. Japan was chosen for its consistent and thoughtful approach to web3-friendly regulation, despite a slow pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:08:00">[33:08:00]</a>.

## Growth and Future Vision

The Backpack Exchange launched with a large distribution event, partnering with Pyth Network to give out 10 million PYTH tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>. This event led to 140,000 KYC users in the first week and 74,000 participants in the Pyth drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:29:00">[35:29:00]</a>, despite breaking systems and requiring intense work for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>. This intense period hardened the team and improved their systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>.

The exchange has seen significant growth, with over 350,000 active traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>. A point system launched in February generated absurd spot volume, reaching $27.5 billion between February 13th and March 18th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:04:00">[37:04:00]</a>, including days with over a billion dollars in volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:00]</a>. A distribution of 27 million Wormhole tokens to 300,000 traders followed the first snapshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50:00">[37:50:00]</a>, and a second snapshot saw a day of $8.6 billion in spot volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:30:00">[38:30:00]</a>. This stress-tested infrastructure and consistently increased organic trading volume between events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:08:00">[39:08:00]</a>.

The exchange actively drives users to the on-chain world; for example, requiring users to connect their wallet and make a trade on Tensor for the Tensor token drop, which onboarded approximately 100,000 new users to an on-chain protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:31:00">[40:31:00]</a>.

The team aims to become a Mainstay International cryptocurrency exchange and one of the largest exchanges in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:07:00">[48:07:00]</a>.

## Key Principles of Community Building

Tristan emphasizes that successful projects in crypto must understand that the space is "ran by crypto Twitter" and storytelling happens through this medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:58:00">[44:58:00]</a>. Therefore, having an entertainment side and not taking oneself too seriously is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:07:00">[45:07:00]</a>. This involves making content that appeals to both "mid-curvers" (who might criticize) and "left/right-curvers" (who appreciate the humor and genuine engagement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>.

A core message to the Mad Lads community from the beginning was "no utility, this is a rug, send it to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:45:00">[46:45:00]</a>. This approach fostered a community with "no expectations, just vibe, just enjoy the journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:04:00]</a>.

The ultimate advice offered is to "live from a place of gratitude," being grateful for every moment, breath, and connection, as life is transient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:02:00">[50:02:00]</a>. This perspective makes it easier to be happy and appreciative of all experiences, both terrible and joyful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a>.

For [[early_stage_founders_and_leadership|early stage founders]], the concept of leadership is initially "completely out of question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The primary job of a founder is to literally do everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Founder as a "Soldier"

Greatest founders who eventually became leaders started as "great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This means they were hands-on and involved in every aspect of the startup initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

The advice for new founders is to be a great soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Founders should fight many battles on the ground themselves before they consider hiring additional personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This direct experience on the front lines is crucial for understanding how to [[hiring_and_cofounder_selection|hire great soldiers]] later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Initial Responsibilities of the Founder

A founder, acting as a "soldier," is expected to handle a wide range of tasks personally, including:
*   Coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Even cleaning their own chairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Dealing with lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Dealing with accountants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

## Transition to Leadership

There is a natural transition period where a founder grows into the role of a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While there is ample support for individuals aiming to become leaders, there is significantly less support for those who need to become great soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

A "great warrior" who has experienced fighting on the ground is more likely to become an effective leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Conversely, a leader who has never engaged in the ground-level battles is less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Counterintuitive Advice
> The initial role of a founder is "super counterintuitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>; it requires them to be an individual contributor in nearly every aspect of the business before transitioning into a leadership position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

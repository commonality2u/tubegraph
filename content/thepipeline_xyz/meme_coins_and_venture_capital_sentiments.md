The sentiment surrounding [[The risks and misconceptions around meme coins | meme coins]] within venture capital (VC) circles has notably evolved, moving from initial derision to a more nuanced understanding of their market implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

## Venture Capital's Role in Crypto Development
On social media platforms like Twitter, a common sentiment is that VCs are detrimental to the crypto space, viewing [[Impact of meme coins on financial markets | meme coins]] as an egalitarian technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. This perspective often frames venture investment as "evil" and something that disadvantages the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

However, venture funding is critical for developing complex blockchain technologies, such as high-performance, low-fee EVM chains like Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Building these foundational technologies requires significant investment to hire engineers and solve challenging problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Venture funding contributes significantly more positive outcomes for the applications users want to use than is often acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

While there are "good and bad" VCs, and past instances exist where VC-heavy projects led to retail investors being "dumped on," funding is essential for development beyond just [[Role of meme coins in crypto ecosystem | meme coin]] projects with no utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

## [[Evolution of meme coins sentiment in venture capital | Evolution of VC Sentiment Towards Meme Coins]]
Initially, VCs were perceived as laughing at and insulting [[The growing popularity of meme coins | meme coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. This changed as they recognized the limitations of the "high FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation), low float" meta, where there are few buyers for unlocked tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

### Incentives and Reputation
The primary reason for VC disdain towards [[The risks and misconceptions around meme coins | meme coins]] is not necessarily personal dislike, but rather the differing incentives of those operating in the venture space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. VCs need to raise funds, and a positive reputation for crypto facilitates discussions with large investors about the future of finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

It becomes more challenging for VCs to justify investments when the public perception of crypto is dominated by "Harry Potter Obama Sonic 10" tokens rather than legitimate emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. [[Challenges faced by VCs with meme coins | Meme coins]] can create confusion, as they appear alongside more traditional financial assets, making it harder for VCs to explain their value to limited partners (LPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

### Open and Permissionless Nature
The permissionless nature of crypto means anyone can create [[The growing popularity of meme coins | meme coins]], which makes it harder for those trying to promote the "good aspects" of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Despite this, some individuals in the VC space are personally "pro-meme coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.

### "Builder Cope" and Financial Nihilism
There is a "builder cope" phenomenon among development teams regarding [[The risks and misconceptions around meme coins | meme coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. The concern is not simply that [[The growing popularity of meme coins | meme coins]] are pumping, but that their success can foster "financial nihilism" â€“ the belief that the entire industry is a scam, because people attribute the easy money made from [[The appeal of meme coins to average users | meme coins]] to all crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. This narrative can be frustrating for teams building meaningful projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

Concerns also exist regarding opaque token unlock schedules and OTC (Over-The-Counter) token sales, which can disproportionately benefit founders and institutions at the expense of retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

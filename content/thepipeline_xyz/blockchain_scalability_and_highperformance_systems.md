Monad Labs, with CEO Keone and Developer Relations Lead Kevin G, is focused on creating a [[high performance blockchains | high-performance blockchain]] that revamps the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Their mission centers on addressing the [[challenges_in_building_highperformance_systems | challenges]] in scaling the EVM to enable broader adoption of decentralized applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## The Need for EVM Scalability
Despite the popularity of Layer 2 (L2) solutions and other scaling efforts in early 2022, Monad identified a critical need to focus on the EVM's execution stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The EVM is currently the dominant standard for smart contracts, holding 98% of all Total Value Locked (TVL) in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Historically, the original Ethereum developers designed a system that allowed for broad composability, where applications like ERC20 tokens could be implemented at the smart contract layer rather than the base layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. However, practical limitations have emerged due to high gas costs and the nature of Ethereum as a "global queue" with limited transaction space per block (around 200 transactions every 12 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This has severely limited the extent of composability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

## Monad's Technical Approach to High Performance
Monad's approach involves fundamental optimizations to the EVM execution, including:
*   **Parallel Execution:** Introducing parallel execution to significantly improve performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **High-Performance State Database:** Developing a state database that stores data in a Merkle tree while supporting many parallel reads and writes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This addresses [[challenges_of_standard_databases_in_blockchain_performance | bottlenecks]] present in the Ethereum Virtual Machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Fundamentals First Principles:** Taking a fundamental, first-principles approach to solving performance problems, applying best practices from 30 years of [[high performance blockchains | high-performance computing]] to blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

By rebuilding the execution stack from the ground up, Monad aims to achieve execution [[blockchain_performance_optimization | performance]] that is currently unmatched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Enabling New Use Cases and Composability
A core value proposition of Monad is enhancing composability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Existing limitations on other blockchains, such as Solana's Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) depth of three, or the practical gas limits on EVM, restrict how deeply smart contracts can interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Monad aims to remove these gas constraints, allowing for greater freedom in building and composing applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

This increased capacity is envisioned to "accelerate" the EVM, similar to how electric cars offered a new spectrum of possibilities compared to gas-powered ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. It enables previously "cost-prohibitive" ideas, such as:
*   **Event Ticketing as NFTs:** Issuing concert tickets as NFTs could provide digital mementos, but current gas costs make this unfeasible on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
*   **Advanced NFT Standards:** More complex NFT standards that include in-protocol royalty enforcement or loyalty program tracking are currently too expensive to implement and gain adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Mass Adoption of DeFi:** Current DeFi applications are "dogfooded" by crypto natives but would not scale to normal adoption levels due to expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Monad aims to scale these to many more users, making business models more sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **Context-Aware Web3 Experiences:** The ability to store user data in wallets and have applications service content based on that data, without privacy concerns, could unlock new native web2-like experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. This requires a chain with high throughput and low fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

Keone is particularly excited about decentralized finance (DeFi) applications such as money markets, decentralized exchanges, derivatives, and high-fidelity oracles, as well as consumer-facing apps like sports betting, on-chain casinos, and social applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

## Team Expertise
Monad Labs' team of approximately 25 people specializes in building [[high performance blockchains | high-performance]], low-latency systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Their background includes experience in high-frequency trading and low-level systems engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This expertise is crucial because parts of a blockchain like Monad function as a database, requiring in-depth knowledge of system performance, including kernel-level optimizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Builders
Despite the advantages, [[challenges_in_building_highperformance_systems | challenges]] for builders in the EVM environment include:
*   **Funding Acquisition:** Attracting funding, particularly for international builders, remains difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **Security:** Building decentralized applications is inherently challenging due to constant probing by black-hat hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. Lowering gas costs, as Monad aims to do, can enable developers to include more defensive assertions in their code without prohibitive expense, thereby improving security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.

However, the strong crypto community offers a significant advantage, providing eager users and support that traditional tech startups often lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

Monad aims to bridge the gap between traditional web2 developers and web3, by providing real-world use cases with user experiences (UX/UI) similar to web2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. This could encourage more web2 developers to explore building on blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. The goal is to make blockchain development feel like "just building an app," enabling developers to focus on unique experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>.

## Measuring Performance (TPS)
The concept of Transactions Per Second (TPS) as a metric for [[blockchain performance optimization | blockchain performance optimization]] can be confusing due to non-uniform measurement practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>.
*   **Voting Transactions:** In Solana, official block explorers may include validator votes in the total TPS count, which are technically transactions but not user-initiated smart contract interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. Solana's true TPS (user transactions) is around 500 transactions per second, while votes might add another 2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. Monad intends to only count actual smart contract interactions and transfers in its advertised TPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.
*   **Instruction Counting:** Some chains, like Aptos or Sui, may count individual instructions within a smart contract invocation as separate transactions, artificially inflating TPS numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.
*   **Capacity vs. Demand:** Current TPS numbers often reflect current demand rather than the system's maximum capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>. Testnet benchmarks can be misleading if they don't accurately reflect production environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.
*   **Transaction Size:** Transactions on different systems can vary greatly in size and complexity, making direct TPS comparisons inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>. A more abstract metric like raw bytes per second propagated through the system could be a better benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. Monad plans to provide reproducible benchmarks using historical Ethereum transaction history as a proxy for real-life activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

## Future Vision
Monad's long-term vision is not to replace Ethereum, but to expand the overall "pie" of blockchain users by focusing on new user acquisition from Web2 and delivering compelling, decentralized applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. While Monad currently stands out through its [[Monads HighPerformance Blockchain Features | performance]] and ability to enable new use cases, the expectation is that over time, other systems will also improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. Monad's continued differentiation will come from its commitment to pushing the limits of technology, introducing new features like op codes and integrations, and maintaining a high degree of decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

The [[evolution_and_impact_of_highperformance_blockchain_technology | evolution and impact of high-performance blockchain technology]] aims to make crypto pervasive globally, similar to how WeChat has become an all-encompassing platform in China, allowing users to interact with various services through a decentralized wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Ultimately, the goal is to make these services significantly cheaper for mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. The ability to leverage the existing EVM research community, developer tooling, and applied cryptography efforts is crucial for advancing the entire space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

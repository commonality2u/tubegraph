From: [[thepipeline_xyz]] <br/> 

The [[History of the Monad Community | Monad community]] has developed extensive lore and a rich tapestry of memes and notable events over the past two years, becoming a formidable and well-known organization in the broader cryptocurrency community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This article takes a deep dive through various elements of this lore, answering questions about character origins and the source of prevalent mimetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

It's helpful to view [[Understanding Monad and its community | Monad lore]] through the analogy of an iceberg, where much of the mass lies beneath the surface, hidden from plain sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Top of the Iceberg (Widely Known)

These are the most prevalent elements of [[Understanding Monad and its community | Monad lore]], widely recognized within and beyond the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Ganad
Ganad is one of the most obvious "calling cards" of [[What is Monad | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Origin**: The first Ganad tweet, a simple "GM," was sent in December 2022, shortly after control of the Twitter account was handed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Art**: John W Rich Kid, a friend with no initial affiliation to [[What is Monad | Monad]], created the art for the purple Pepe Ganad sticker packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Pronunciation**: There are multiple pronunciations like "gonad" and "ganad," but no definitive right answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The first recorded "gamanad" in the Discord was from Bill Monday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### [[What is Monad | Monad]] as a Layer 1
[[What is Monad | Monad]] is fundamentally a layer one blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Origin**: In late 2021/early 2022, when founders Keon and James left Jump, many projects were trying to start layer 2 blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. However, Keon and James made specific design choices that favored a layer one, opting to go "upstream" against the prevailing trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### 100% EVM Compatible
This was a significant design choice made in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Significance**: Unlike some scaling solutions (e.g., ZK sync) that required code changes, [[What is Monad | Monad]] aimed for 100% EVM compatibility down to the bytecode level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This allowed full leverage of the resources and collateral built for the Ethereum ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The decision to achieve 100% compatibility, rather than 97%, was an important conceptual play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### 10,000 TPS
The number 10,000 is important in the [[Importance of the Monad community | Monad community]], primarily for its original application as a performance benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Origin**: Ethereum typically handles about 10 transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. [[Technical Aspects and Innovations in Monad | Monad]] aimed for four key performance improvements, anticipating a three-orders-of-magnitude increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The initial pitch was to be 10,000 times faster than Ethereum on similar hardware, leading to the 10,000 TPS benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This target was suggested by Jack, leading to a "reverse-engineered" approach to achieve 10x at four different layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Mandac
The beloved Mandac, a purple hedgehog, emerged as a prominent figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Origin**: Sapphire dropped a picture of the purple hedgehog into the Discord, and Bill Monday later picked it up and popularized it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Usage**: Early usage involved photoshopping Mandac into historical photos to suggest its omnipresence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Name**: The name "Mandac" came from the file name "mandak PNG" when downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Months later, it was discovered that "landak" means "hedgehog" in Indonesian, combining "Mo" (for Monad) and "landak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

### Memes of the Week
*   **Origin**: Inspired by Greg's recurring "good morning" tweet chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. It was designed as a weekly tweet to showcase the four best memes of the week, especially as community art and memes exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   **Status**: It ran for a year, reaching 52 editions before spontaneously ending, as the volume of memes outgrew the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

### Original Purple Pepe
Before Mandac, the purple Pepe served as [[What is Monad | Monad's]] initial placeholder mascot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Pepe was a staple of crypto Twitter, and giving it a unique purple color provided a customizable character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **Creator**: John W Rich Kid again created the initial purple Pepe images as a friend before his formal affiliation with [[What is Monad | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. It set the right tone for future characters like Mandac and Moyak Chog, with similar facial features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### John W Rich Kid the Fry Cook
John W Rich Kid, a friend who created early art for [[What is Monad | Monad]], has his own lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Origin**: During the peak 2021 shitcoin season, Tunes mentored John W, giving him trading tips and teaching him fundamentals, essentially serving as his mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

### Thursday Purge Day
A significant ritual in the [[Importance of the Monad community | Monad community]]'s early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   **Origin**: The locked Telegram group, established in April 2023, was capped at 999 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. To make room for new people, Thursday Purge Day was created as a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.
*   **Process**: At noon on Thursdays, John W Rich Kid would "execute" members, initially 100 people, then 50, then 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. This served to "trim the fat" from the chat and provided a dramatic public event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

## Deeper Layers (Specific and Niche)

These elements delve into more obscure or detailed aspects of [[Understanding Monad and its community | Monad's lore]].

### Chog
A unique variant of the Mandac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   **Origin**: Chog is an AI representation of a Mandac, created when Ray J drew a Mandac in an AI program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. The most familiar Chog is called Monal, who is Ray J's son, making Monal both a Chog and a Mandac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Chog is defined by its pink under-eye bags/circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. Research suggests a DNA split from the Mandac species occurred about 1.8 million years ago, leading Chog to become its own species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
*   **Chog Thoughts**: Chog's brain was uploaded into a computer, becoming the first real AI Twitter account, predating the current AI meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

### Poker Nights on Discord
*   **Origin**: Started as "Ports poker," named after Port who has run it for over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. The idea, initial setup, and blind settings were designed by Youngest Peso and have remained largely unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. It is considered the first weekly event that has maintained its relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

### Intern Locked in the Bathroom
A memorable incident involving Kevin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
*   **Event**: While working in the office, Kevin entered a bathroom with a broken door handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. He was accidentally (or perhaps intentionally) locked inside for about 25 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Kieran and James eventually kicked down the door to release him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

### Mon Hats
A key element for "monifying" memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.
*   **Origin**: The original was the "Dapper Pepe" bowler hat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. Later, a beanie with "nipples" on top, inspired by observations in New York, was created by Han River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. These hats have had good staying power, with people wearing them in real life and incorporating them into memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

### Danny Pipes Come Up (The Pipeline Podcast)
The podcast itself has become part of the lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
*   **Origin**: Danny spent significant time in the [[Understanding Monad and its community | Monad community]] in early 2023, appreciating its refreshing vibes and learning about [[Technical Aspects and Innovations in Monad | Monad's technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. He found it difficult to get accurate, consistent, high-level information about different chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. This led him to create a podcast and media arm, "The Pipeline," to provide daily updates, news, and alpha on [[What is Monad | Monad]] for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

### Salmonad
A character often described as useless and empathetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
*   **Description**: Salmonad is a salmon with "no real defining skills or traits," and "no direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. It has been adopted by the developer community, perhaps out of pity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. Salmonad tends to resonate with "extreme empaths" and is humorously referred to as "homeless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>.

### The Mooch
*   **Origin**: Simply a reference to the French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>, particularly reinforced by frustration with the overpowered French team in FIFA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

### The Cake Punch Incident
A memorable event in the [[Importance of the Monad community | Monad community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.
*   **Event**: Claire, an active Korean ad and talented baker, created a beautiful, ornately decorated [[What is Monad | Monad]] cake with the logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. She then livestreamed or recorded herself punching her fist through the cake, a provocative act that "got the people going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

### MonMemGenerator.com
A tool to facilitate meme creation within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.
*   **Origin**: The initial idea was to easily add the "Dapper Pepe hat" to other images to "monify" memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. Jack (the intern) used old, "shitty" GitHub code that allowed drag-and-drop stickers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. It initially only had the [[What is Monad | Monad]] bowler hat and allowed users to upload a background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. As AI tools became popular, it was adapted to incorporate AI-generated backgrounds and other [[What is Monad | Monad]] characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. Jack self-taught enough coding using GPT to add multiple picture support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. The site has since been taken over by Contribution DAO and is now a "nice functioning site" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.

### Fake One Fone
*   **Origin**: "Fake One Fone" was an LA rapper with thousands of "street tweets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>. His account was hacked, and his profile picture and name were changed to Keon, making it appear as if Keon had tweeted years of rap-related content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.

### Port is Not Real
*   **Lore**: In the early days, there was speculation that Port was not a real person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. However, it was later confirmed that "he is real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. This also ties into the concept of "AI Port," who has made notable appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

### Beads Day
*   **Event**: A very exciting holiday in the [[Importance of the Monad community | Monad community]] where everyone changed their profile picture to "beads" and pretended to be beads for a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.

### Live Laugh and Monad
*   **Origin**: This phrase originated from a non-native English speaker in the Discord who simply commented "I love Monet so much," which was then adopted wholesale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

### Madel
A "mon animal" that never gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>.
*   **Description**: Madel is described as looking like a transitional animal from the history of evolution—like a fish crawling on land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. It was quickly abandoned by the community and is seen as the "awkward middle school pictures" of the [[What is Monad | Monad]] community's animal representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>. It's also compared to a Mandac plushy put in a dryer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

### Monal Weasley
*   **Origin**: Ray J called Chog "Monal," but people pointed out that "Monal Weasley" existed first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>. It was a failed character based on Harry Potter that never took off, and the name was later recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

### Shrimp Posting / Shrimp Decks
One of Ray J's earliest obsessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.
*   **Origin**: In the "crypto winter" days, Ray J explored alternative income sources, specifically high-density aquaponic shrimp farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. This led to ideas around "shrimp decks," "shrimp NFTs," and general "shrimp posting" before other animals became popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.

### Tunes You're Fired
*   **Origin**: A running joke where Kevin frequently tells Tunes he would be "fired" for his actions in any other industry or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. Tunes is aware he has a "50 strikes" allowance and is currently only at around 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>.

### Moss Fatu
Another failed "mon animal" from the deepest parts of the lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
*   **Description**: Its name, pronounced "Nosferatu," is a reference to the Dracula/vampire lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. It's also linked to an early 2000s SpongeBob episode where a Dracula-like character called "Nosferatu" is flickering lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. Despite some creative origin, it, like a vampire, "died" once it touched the sunlight of broader community exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.

### Bill Monday Equals Plant
*   **Origin**: When Bill Monday would stream, he would place a camera on a plant as his stream feed, changing plants each week, to maintain his anonymity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>.

### Mcraft
[[Humorous hypotheticals involving Monad | Gaming]] was a fundamental part of early [[Importance of the Monad community | Monad community]] events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Origin**: About 13 months prior to the discussion (around early 2023), a custom [[What is Monad | Monad]]-themed Minecraft server was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. It hosted "Bean ads" themed happy hours and encouraged people to create [[What is Monad | Monad]]-themed dwellings, sculptures, and statues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

### Dong Dang Do Mr Bill
*   **Origin**: This phrase comes from an AI video by Ray J, where Bean ads would say "Please don't beat me Mr. Bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. The phrase was translated into Vietnamese, leading to the bastardized pronunciation "Dong Dango" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

### Samantha
The deepest and most mysterious element of [[Understanding Monad and its community | Monad lore]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.
*   **Description**: Samantha is known to be redheaded and an ex-girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. Her exact identity and story remain largely unknown, shrouded in mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>. A shrine to Samantha was built in Mcraft in the early days to try and lure her back, but it was unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[Understanding Monad and its community | Monad community]] has fostered a unique and extensive collection of lore, memes, and events over its two-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. This deep dive reveals the creativity and shared experiences that have shaped its identity.

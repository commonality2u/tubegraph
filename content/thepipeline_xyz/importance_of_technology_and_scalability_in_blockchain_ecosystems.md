The pipeline podcast hosted Brandon Milman, CEO and co-founder at Phantom, Brian Freel, Head of Ecosystem Success at Phantom, and Keone Han, CEO and co-founder at Monad Labs, to discuss the importance of technology and scalability in blockchain ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This discussion followed a major announcement that Phantom will support Monad from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Phantom's Strategic Approach to Chain Support

Phantom's decision-making process for supporting new chains is heavily influenced by [[technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The company believes the blockchain world will be multi-chain, with perhaps two to five dominant ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Their role is to identify the chains poised to emerge as winners, with [[Technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | technology]] being the most crucial underlying tenet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

The immediate need for [[Blockchain scalability and highperformance systems | scalable technology]] is paramount, as Phantom is experiencing a massive influx of users who require solutions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This focus on [[Blockchain scalability and highperformance systems | scalability]] reminds Brandon Milman of Solana's pragmatic approach to the market, which prioritized [[Technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | innovation]] in consensus and parallel execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Monad's [[Technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | Technological Innovations]]

Monad's approach to [[Technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | technology]] and its [[Blockchain scalability and highperformance systems | EVM compatibility]] are key factors for Phantom's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Monad's [[Technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | innovations]] in consensus and parallel execution allow it to offer fast and cheap transactions, marrying the user base's need for efficiency with the robust existing EVM ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Monad aims to provide the best of both worlds between performance and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. Keone Han explained that achieving high performance requires significant software changes, new architecture, and low-level optimization to address bottlenecks in a highly decentralized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. The goal is to always move "up and to the right" on a graph of performance versus decentralization, utilizing novel architecture and software improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.

### Layer 1 vs. Layer 2

Monad's decision to launch as a Layer 1 (L1) rather than a Layer 2 (L2) was driven by three major reasons: decentralization, performance, and cost for end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. Keone Han emphasized that decentralization in this context means decentralized control of block production, avoiding a single sequencer, and enforcing censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. Given the current state of L2s, Monad didn't see the same level of decentralization without significant compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. Therefore, building as an L1 was crucial to push the envelope of what's possible in both performance and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

## User Experience and [[Future potential and scalability in the crypto space | Future Use Cases]]

Phantom views itself as the front end for crypto, aiming to boil down and present the best of the crypto world that emerges from its open, permissionless arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. A key aspect of wallet user experience is to enable the discovery and navigation of the ecosystem in a safe and easy way, especially as the proliferation of content like tokens, NFTs, and dApps continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

The breakthroughs in underlying [[Technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | technology]], making systems more [[Blockchain scalability and highperformance systems | scalable]], are enabling new use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

### Novel Applications and Payments

*   **WeChat Analogy**: Keone Han envisions the future of crypto as similar to WeChat, an immersive environment where users can chat, order food, hire services, and apply for jobs, all embedded within a single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. A wallet, combined with blockchain's shared global state and composability, has the best chance of enacting this vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Payments**: Brandon Milman is bullish on crypto payments, particularly with Stripe's recent announcement enabling any merchant to accept crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This could change the market structure by making crypto a cheaper alternative to credit card payments for retail stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Creator Monetization**: Brian Freel highlighted Drip House in the Solana ecosystem as an example of how [[Technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | scalable systems]] like Monad or Solana can enable new approaches to creator monetization, moving beyond scarce NFTs to relationships with creators and micro-payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

## [[Interoperability and blockchain communication | Multi-chain Connectivity]] and Bridging

[[Interoperability and blockchain communication | Connectivity]] with other ecosystems is crucial for new players like Monad in the EVM space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. Phantom plans to embed bridges directly into the wallet to enable seamless movement of funds between chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. These "generalized bridges" allow swapping assets across different blockchains, a functionality Phantom aims to integrate directly into its swap features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

Bridging is seen as a fundamental cornerstone for ecosystems, as liquidity is the lifeblood of financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. Phantom has experience with bridging fungible tokens and NFTs, having worked with teams like DeGods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Wallet-integrated bridges are a significant unlock, simplifying the often tedious transaction confirmations for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

## The Role of Community in [[Growth and scalability challenges in blockchain ecosystems | Growth and Adoption]]

Phantom's success, including its rise to number one on the US Google Play Store for finance apps, is attributed to prioritizing [[building community within blockchain ecosystems | community]] and focusing on user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Phantom's initial strategy involved planting a flag in a new ecosystem (Solana) where there was less noise and fewer established competitors, becoming a cornerstone of the Solana user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.

This decision was a "contrarian bet" at a time when EVM dominance was assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>. The Solana ecosystem's shared experience of building a new chain from the ground up fostered a genuine "kernel of culture" and [[building community within blockchain ecosystems | community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. Phantom learned to stay close to this core, genuine [[building community within blockchain ecosystems | community]], even during challenging times like the FTX collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. This focus on [[building community within blockchain ecosystems | community]] and understanding user needs has been the biggest driver of Phantom's success, and they see Monad embodying a similar spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

## Final Alpha

*   **Listen to Users**: If building a product, find your core users, understand their needs ("jobs to be done"), listen to raw feedback, and adjust priorities based on their input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Assume Crypto Dominance**: Mentally internalize that crypto will take over the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. Then, consider how this certainty would change your behavior and how you can add value to the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>. Start small and be consistent, as results compound quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>.
*   **Avoid Tribalism**: Engaging in frivolous tribalism in crypto is counterproductive and a zero-sum mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. Instead, focus efforts on [[growth and scalability challenges in blockchain ecosystems | growing the pie]] for billions of users and give new entrants a welcoming impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. Removing preconceived notions and biases opens up many opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.

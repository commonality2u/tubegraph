RareBetSports (RBS) is a [[daily_fantasy_sports_and_its_differentiation_from_traditional_sports_betting | Daily Fantasy Sports]] (DFS) platform built on Monad, marking the first Monad Native episode of "The Pipeline" [00:00:06]. It aims to be an entire ecosystem, with its first product being RARLink [00:01:03]. RareBetSports has been developed in stealth mode to build momentum and hype [00:01:13, 00:01:45]. The core mission of RareBetSports is to onboard the next billion crypto users through sports and the RBS ecosystem [00:03:12, 00:14:44].

## What is Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS)?

Unlike traditional sports betting, which focuses on game outcomes like money lines or over/unders on total scores, [[daily_fantasy_sports_and_its_differentiation_from_traditional_sports_betting | Daily Fantasy Sports]] centers on individual players and their statistics [00:02:00, 00:02:16]. Players test their skill by predicting whether a given player statistic will be higher or lower than a set line [00:02:20, 00:07:56]. This format has gained significant popularity in the US, with companies like PrizePicks exploring the DFS vertical [00:02:30, 00:02:38].

Key aspects of DFS:
*   **Player-Centric Focus** In DFS, the emphasis is on individual player performance (e.g., LeBron James, Patrick Mahomes) rather than the overall team's victory [00:02:53]. This makes it more accessible for less savvy bettors [00:02:44].
*   **Legal Differentiation** DFS operates within a distinct legal carve-out in the US, differentiating it from traditional gambling or sports books [00:03:28, 00:03:30]. This allows RareBetSports to operate within this framework [00:03:37].
*   **Proprietary Building** RareBetSports distinguishes itself from many existing Web3 sportsbooks, which are often white-labeled and lack proprietary features [00:03:56, 00:03:58]. RBS is building a proprietary product designed with Web3 principles from the ground up [00:04:25, 00:04:27].

## RARLink: The First Product

RARLink is the inaugural product within the RareBetSports ecosystem [00:07:50]. It functions as a "pick 'em" style game where users select over/under predictions on player proposition bets [00:07:54, 00:07:56]. The goal is to allow users to significantly multiply their crypto holdings [00:08:01]. RARLink was conceptualized during a bear market to provide utility to various tokens, communities, and NFT communities that struggled to drive revenue from secondary sales [00:06:15, 00:06:23].

## Advantages of Building on Blockchain

RareBetSports leverages blockchain technology to offer unique advantages:

*   **[[community_engagement_and_strategies_for_rarebetsports | Community Focus]]**
    *   Web2 platforms often lack a [[community_engagement_and_strategies_for_rarebetsports | community-focused approach]] [00:05:53, 00:05:56]. RareBetSports is built with [[community_engagement_and_strategies_for_rarebetsports | community]] as part of its DNA, allowing it to reward various communities on its platform [00:05:59, 00:06:08].
    *   The platform aims to provide a fun touchpoint for communities to engage with their tokens [00:10:20, 00:10:36].

*   **Monad Ecosystem**
    *   RareBetSports chose Monad due to its existing hungry user base and the community Monad has cultivated [00:10:11, 00:10:12].
    *   Monad's technical capabilities, including 10,000 transactions per second and sub-cent gas fees, enable a seamless consumer experience without burdening users with high fees or long settlement times [00:12:39, 00:12:47, 00:12:50, 00:12:54, 00:12:56].
    *   Building on Monad has also been beneficial for fundraising, attracting exposure from investors interested in consumer-facing crypto applications [00:13:05, 00:13:12, 00:13:14].

*   **Market Fit and Growth**
    *   [[future_of_online_gambling | Sports betting]] and [[daily_fantasy_sports_and_its_differentiation_from_traditional_sports_betting | fantasy sports]] have a proven market fit in Web2 and present an open playing field in Web3 [00:14:14, 00:27:02].
    *   Sports provide year-round entertainment and opportunities for the project [00:14:25].
    *   The gambling sector tends to be resistant to bear markets, providing stability [00:14:32, 00:14:36].

## [[innovations_in_user_experience_for_betting_platforms | User Experience and Onboarding]]

RareBetSports prioritizes a smooth [[innovations_in_user_experience_for_betting_platforms | user experience]], particularly for non-crypto natives:
*   **Abstraction of Blockchain** The platform aims to hide the underlying blockchain from the user, similar to how NBA Top Shot successfully abstracted Flow blockchain [00:19:38, 00:20:00]. The goal is for users to interact with RBS or RARLink without even knowing they are on a blockchain [00:21:54, 00:21:56].
*   **Account Abstraction** For Web2 users, RareBetSports plans to utilize account abstraction tools, allowing logins via Twitter or Facebook [00:19:13, 00:20:15, 00:20:16].
*   **Seamless On-Ramping** The app will provide tools for on-ramping and bridging, working with partners to make these processes easier than current crypto experiences [00:20:32, 00:20:33, 00:20:35].
*   **Time to Fun** A core focus is minimizing the "time to fun," allowing users to quickly engage with the application after downloading [00:28:34, 00:28:44, 00:29:36].
*   **Innovative UI** The mobile user interface features a swiping approach (like Tinder) to allow users to close a wager with a single click, streamlining the betting process [00:25:28, 00:25:31, 00:30:13, 00:30:15]. This proprietary design allows for continuous evolution with crypto narratives [00:07:15, 00:07:17, 00:07:21].

## Game and Sport Offerings

Initially, RareBetSports plans to support English Premier League, NFL, and NBA games upon rollout, adjusting with the sport cycles throughout the year [00:16:05, 00:16:10]. They are also actively exploring Esports, with data feeds already available for games like League of Legends and CS2 [00:16:15, 00:16:18, 00:16:21]. The team believes Esports betting is rapidly growing and has massive potential, especially with its recent inclusion as an official Olympic sport [00:16:31, 00:17:01, 00:17:09]. Furthermore, RareBetSports is looking into [[revolutionizing_sports_betting_with_blockchain | on-chain gaming]] and blockchain gaming as potential betting avenues, something Web2 companies cannot offer [00:15:32, 00:15:36].

Monad Games is described as a high-stakes, "no holds bar competition" where five contestants battle to earn testnet tokens, known as T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The ultimate prize for the player with the most tokens by the end is $5,000, which is to be given away to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The atmosphere is tense, with participants noting their fear and the "dicey" nature of the challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Core Mechanics and Stakes
The competition revolves around accumulating T-Mo tokens through various challenges. The prize of $5,000 for the winner to distribute to the community incentivizes aggressive play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Losing has significant consequences, with hints that the last-place contestant faces an undesirable outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Contestants
Prior to the challenges, [[contestant_profiling_and_challenges_faced | contestants]] express varying degrees of confidence:
*   One contestant states "10," feeling "very confident" and prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   Another also claims "10" for confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   One takes a more philosophical view, stating it's a "50/50 chance" as they'll either win or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   Another rates their confidence as "Six" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   A fifth contestant gives a precise "6.9 out of 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## Challenges

### Dalgona Cookie Challenge
Inspired by *Squid Game*, this challenge requires contestants to carefully carve out a design from a cookie within 7 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. All contestants chose the "hard" route, which was worth 1,000 T-Mo, over the "easy" route worth 200 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Breaking the cookie results in immediate elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. The contestants refer to themselves as "degenerate gamblers," implying a willingness to take high risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### John's Mystery Meat Challenge
This challenge offers an opportunity to earn back tokens. Contestants are served various random meats and must eat them, with each one worth 100 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. The meats include unusual options like alligator, bison, yak, kangaroo, wild boar, rabbit, rattlesnake, antelope, venison, and "Rocky Mountain oysters" (bull testicles), alongside traditional chicken sausage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. Contestants do not know what they are eating until after they've tried it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

### Influence Ranking Challenge
Contestants are asked to self-arrange themselves from most to least influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. An "expert psychic" then re-arranges them based on intuition after 5-minute readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.
*   If a contestant is placed in the exact same spot they chose, they win 500 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.
*   If a contestant is placed in the number one spot, they win 1,000 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   Each contestant also has 15 seconds to plead their case for being the most influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

### [[pitch_competition_dynamics | Pitch Competition Dynamics]] (Hot or Not)
In this challenge, contestants must pitch a random, non-existent startup idea to the group within 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>. The other four contestants judge and score the pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>. To earn more tokens, the contestant must also consume a spicy item:
*   Jelly beans: 200 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>
*   World's hottest chocolate: 500 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>
*   One Chip Challenge: 2,000 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>
Drinking yogurt before the timer is up results in no points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. The winner of this round receives 1,500 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

### Ice Block Seed Phrase Challenge
Contestants must choose a tool (e.g., tongs, keyboard, spoon) to break open a block of ice within 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>. Inside each block are eight words, which form a numbered seed phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>. The goal is to retrieve the words and state them in the correct order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>. This challenge is "all or nothing," worth 1,500 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. One contestant successfully bribed another for a word, paying 300 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>.

### Split or Steal (Psychological Game)
The final game is psychological, worth the most tokens at 2,500 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>. Contestants secretly choose to "split" or "steal" on a note card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:34:00">[31:34:00]</a>. The outcome depends on collective decisions:
*   **Everybody splits:** Each contestant gets 500 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:49:00">[31:49:00]</a>.
*   **Only one person steals:** That person takes all 2,500 T-Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>.
*   **Two or more people steal:** The splitters get everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>.
*   **Three or more people steal:** No one wins anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a>.
The game is explicitly described as a "game of trust, strategy, and maybe a little backstabbing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>.

## [[competition_results_and_winnings | Competition Results and Winnings]] and Outcome
In the final "Split or Steal" challenge, one contestant (Professor Pipelines) chose to steal, while the others chose to split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:35:00">[34:35:00]</a>. According to the rules, if only one person steals, they take all the tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>.
Professor Pipelines (Danny) was declared the overall winner of Monad Games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>, winning the $5,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>. Despite stealing the final tokens, he unexpectedly decided to split the $5,000 prize among three other "OG Monad community members" (Pre-balling, Spam, and KB), expressing gratitude for their participation and the memories made within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>.

The Monad Games is a competition where five contestants battle for test net tokens, also known as T-Mo, with the ultimate winner receiving $5,000 to donate to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Beyond standard competitions, the games feature unique and innovative [[spicy_food_challenges | food challenges]], including a segment focused on exotic meats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## John's Mystery Meat Challenge
This challenge presents an opportunity for contestants to earn additional tokens by bravely consuming random, unidentified meats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Each piece of meat successfully eaten is valued at 100 montans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. While all meats are safe to eat, their identities are kept secret, requiring contestants to guess what they are consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Notable Tastings and Reactions
*   One contestant believed the first meat was chicken sausage, but it was revealed to be kangaroo sausage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   A subsequent offering was a "blend" described by the butcher as the "best one," consisting of bison, rabbit, and rattlesnake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   The Rocky Mountain Oysters were consumed, leading to relief among contestants that "at least we got that out of the way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   Another mixed meat, called "Mountain Man," was a combination of elk, venison, antelope, wild boar, and bison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   The final two mystery meats were identified as yak and alligator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. One contestant found a piece of alligator "awful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

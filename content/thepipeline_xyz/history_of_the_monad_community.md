The [[History of the Monad community | Monad community]], often referred to as the "Nads," has evolved significantly over the past two years, becoming a prominent and well-known group within the broader cryptocurrency community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Deep research involving historians, archaeologists, and ethnographers has documented its growth and dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Origins and Early Concepts
The journey began with co-founders Keon and James leaving Jump in late 2021/early 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. While many were focusing on Layer 2 solutions, they decided to build a Layer 1 blockchain, making specific design choices for this fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

A key design choice made in January 2023 by Bill Mundy and others was to ensure [[What is Monad | Monad]] was 100% EVM compatible, all the way to the bytecode level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This decision aimed to leverage the existing resources and collateral from the Ethereum ecosystem and other EVM chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The initial pitch for [[Introduction to Monad and its capabilities | Monad's performance]] was 10,000 TPS, aiming to be 1,000 times faster than Ethereum on similar hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This 10,000 TPS benchmark was initially Keon's marketing contribution and Jack's idea, who suggested the number 10,000 to "blow the doors off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### [[Notable Events and Memes in Monad | Key Community Developments and Lore]]

*   **Ganad (December 2022)**: The first "Ganad" image, a purple Pepe, was created by John W Rich Kid (who had no affiliation to [[What is Monad | Monad]] at the time) as a sticker pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It was used in a simple "GM" tweet and released around the Bill Mundy initialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The word "Ganad" itself has no single right pronunciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Mandac (Purple Hedgehog)**: The beloved Mandac originated when Saphire dropped a picture of a purple hedgehog in the Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Bill Mundy adopted it, and early usage involved photoshopping it into historical photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The name "Mandac" came from the filename "mandak.PNG," and it was later discovered that "landak" means hedgehog in Indonesian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Original Purple Pepe**: Before a community-built mascot, the purple Pepe served as a placeholder character, providing customization to the standard Pepe meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. John W Rich Kid also created the initial purple Pepe images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. This set the tone for future characters like Mandac, which initially had Pepe-esque facial features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Memes of the Week**: This initiative, inspired by Greg's tweet chain, showcased the four best memes of the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. It ran for a year, ending spontaneously after 52 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **John W Rich Kid the Fry Cook**: Tunes describes himself as a mentor to John W Rich Kid, teaching him about fundamentals during the 2021 "shitcoin season" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

To make room for new people, John W Rich Kid would "execute" members (initially 100, then 50, then 20) at noon every Thursday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Chog**: Chog is an AI representation of a Mandac, drawn by RayJ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. The chog familiar to the community is called Monal, who is RayJ's son and genetically both a chog and a Mandac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Chog is defined by pink under-eye bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. There's a "Chog Thoughts" AI Twitter account, with Chog being the first real AI Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

It grew into something much bigger than initially envisioned, celebrating its one-year anniversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.
*   **Salmonad**: Salmonad is described as a "useless" mon animal with no defining skills, adopted by the developer community perhaps out of pity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. He is also described as homeless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.

*   **Port is not real**: An early piece of lore that has since been debunked, as Port is now confirmed to be real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. This also relates to an AI Port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>.

It looks like a "Mandac plushy" put in a dryer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.

*   **Shrimp Posting / Shrimp Dex**: RayJ's earlier obsession, stemming from his research into high-density aquaponic shrimp farming as an alternative income source during a crypto winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. This led to ideas like shrimp NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.
*   **Tunes, You're Fired**: A running joke where Tunes is told he would be fired in any other industry for his actions, though he is given 50 "strikes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

*   **Dong Dango Mr Bill**: A "bastardized phrase" from an AI video by RayJ where Bean Ads would say, "Please don't beat me, Mr. Bill," translated into Vietnamese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.

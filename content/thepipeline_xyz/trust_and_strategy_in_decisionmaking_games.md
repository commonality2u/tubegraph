Monad Games is a [[high_stakes_gaming_competitions | high stakes]], no-holds-barred competition where five contestants battle to earn testnet tokens (T-Mo), with the player accumulating the most tokens winning $5,000 to donate to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The competition involves various [[game_show_challenges_and_tactics | game show challenges]] that test not only skill but also [[decisionmaking_for_crypto_founders | decision-making]] under pressure, often requiring elements of [[building_trust_through_transparency | trust]] and strategy among participants.

## Strategic Choices in Monad Games

Competitors face several strategic choices throughout Monad Games, impacting their token count and overall standing:

### Initial Difficulty Selection
In the first challenge, contestants could choose between an "easy" route worth 200 mana or a "hard" route worth 1,000 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. All contestants collectively chose the "hard" blue option, with one participant stating, "We're degenerate gamblers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This initial decision highlighted a collective risk-taking mentality.

### "Hot or Not" Pitch Challenge
This challenge required contestants to pick a random business startup prompt and pitch it to the group within 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. The strategic element involved choosing a "heat" level, corresponding to a spicy food challenge, which determined the potential token reward:
*   **Jelly Beans:** 200 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>
*   **World's Hottest Chocolate:** 500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>
*   **One Chip Challenge:** 2,000 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>

Competitors had to weigh their tolerance for spice against the desire for higher token rewards. One contestant, Danny, chose the world's hottest chocolate for 500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>, while another opted for the one chip challenge for 2,000 mana despite the extreme discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>. The winner of this round was the "Intern," who delivered the best pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>.

### Seed Phrase Ice Block Challenge
In this challenge, contestants had 10 minutes to break open a block of ice containing eight words of a seed phrase, then correctly order them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>. A moment of strategic [[guessing_games_with_colleagues | guessing game]] and bartering arose when Danny, needing the first word, offered 200 mana (later negotiated to 300) to another contestant for the missing word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:18:00">[30:18:00]</a>. This showcased a direct strategic interaction and a form of trust/transaction within the game. Danny ultimately won this round, earning 1,500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:47:00">[30:47:00]</a>.

## The "Split or Steal" Final Challenge

The final challenge, "Split or Steal," was worth 2,500 tokens and served as a psychological test of [[building_trust_through_transparency | trust]] and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>. Each contestant privately chose to either "split" or "steal."

*   **If everyone splits:** Each player receives 500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:49:00">[31:49:00]</a>.
*   **If only one person steals:** That person takes all of the tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[31:53:00]</a>.
*   **If two or more people steal:** The splitters get everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>.
*   **If three or more people steal:** No one wins anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>.

**Outcomes:**
*   Pre-balling chose to split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>.
*   The Intern chose to split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>.
*   KB chose to split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>.
*   Spam chose to steal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:00">[34:46:00]</a>.
*   Danny chose to steal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:35:00">[34:35:00]</a>.

Since two people (Danny and Spam) chose to steal, the rule stated that "the splitters get everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>. However, in the reveal, it was stated that Danny won the entire thing, taking all the tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>, which contradicts the stated rule for two or more steals. This outcome left the other contestants surprised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>.

Despite the controversial win, Danny (Professor Pipelines) was officially declared the winner of $5,000 to give to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>. In an unexpected move, Danny decided to split the prize money among three other "OG Monad community members" – Pre-balling, Spam, and KB – stating his initial conviction of winning was "BS" and that it was fun vibing with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:33:00">[35:33:00]</a>. This final act ultimately demonstrated a different form of [[building_trust_through_transparency | trust]] and generosity within the competitive framework.

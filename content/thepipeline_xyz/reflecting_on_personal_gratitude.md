## Key Areas of Gratitude

### Relationships
Teach expresses [[important_personal_relationships | gratitude]] for their [[important_personal_relationships | relationships]] with [[important_personal_relationships | friends]] and [[important_personal_relationships | partners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This appreciation is deeply rooted in a personal understanding of their need for collaboration; as a triplet, they have "always had... people around me" since birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. They genuinely enjoy "being able to do things with other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Meaningful Work
A significant source of [[gratitude_for_job_friends_and_weather | gratitude]] is the opportunity to work on something they are "extremely passionate about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This passion leads to [[personal_experiences_of_happiness | waking up excited every single day]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This positive experience contrasts sharply with a previous job from three to four years prior, where such enthusiasm was "100% not the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Teach is currently building "Kizzy," described as the world's first social media betting app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

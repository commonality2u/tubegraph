## Mint Conditions Report
The current market conditions for NFTs are described as "dramatic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>.

### The Disappearance of Artifact Art
Recently, people expressed outrage over the disappearance of [[realworld_applications_of_blockchain_technology_and_nfts | Artifact Art]] NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>. All the NFTs were replaced by a disclaimer from Cloudflare, indicating that the images infringed upon their terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>.

The Artifact team had previously announced they were ceasing development of the collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>. As a result, they aimed to migrate to Arweave, a more decentralized method for storing images on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. During this migration process, a bug occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>. The tech lead for Artifact tweeted that the issue would be resolved soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>. This incident marks another setback for the collection, which has been a source of disappointment for many in the space, despite being acquired by Nike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>.

Most NFTs are not fully stored on-chain; instead, they often link to an image hosted elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>. If the hosting team ceases payment for image hosting indefinitely, the NFT art can simply vanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to research whether an NFT is truly stored on-chain if you plan on holding it long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:58">[01:21:58]</a>. Guidance on setting up more lasting NFT storage methods will be provided in a future thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>.

### Monad Ecosystem NFT News
Within the Monad ecosystem:
*   **Tunes's Paper Handing:** Tunes's "spike" NFT was sold for 69,420, which is understood to be the highest sale for [[challenges_and_successes_in_the_nft_market | NFTs]] on the Monad testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>. While the sale sets a new record, there was frustration as some intended to buy and burn it, but were front-run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>.
*   **Clluminati Applications:** Clluminati, a team well-integrated into the Monad community known for consistent art and activations, will soon open applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>. They will select individuals to receive a whitelist through a form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>.
*   **Antonios Collection:** The Antonios collection, created by Dudnads, features chameleons as its creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>. The lore behind it is that Dudnads sought a nemesis to the "mouch" (a fly), creating an "anti-meme" with the chameleon for every "mouch" meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>. This collection has become popular in the past week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>.
*   **New Honorary NFT:** An honorary NFT has been listed, potentially setting a new record for the highest sale of any NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46">[01:26:46]</a>. This specific honorary NFT is listed for 100,000 MAN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>, which is four times above the current floor price of 25,000-30,000 MAN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>.

### Upcoming Events
*   **NFT Spaces:** An unrecorded hangout for builders, projects, and community members to ask questions and learn together will be held on Friday at 10:00 AM EST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>.
*   **Lau Mint:** The Lau Mint officially begins on May 5th at 2:00 PM UTC for whitelist holders, continuing through multiple stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>. More information can be found on their Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:25">[01:26:25]</a>.

### Community Engagement and Prizes
*   A new Discord role is expected to be created soon, providing special access to a gated faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:02">[01:33:02]</a>. This could be a way for users to acquire enough MAN to purchase high-value NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>.
*   Community members can earn prizes through engagement, such as the "spin to win" wheel, which includes rewards like a "Tunes post," a "KB Photoshop," or a Ky deposit to boost a user's ELO ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:41">[02:04:41]</a>.
*   One prize, a Discord role upgrade, was won by Medusa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:17">[01:48:17]</a>. While the impact of this upgrade is subject to Bill Monday's discretion, it is considered a significant gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:08">[01:58:08]</a>.
*   The community has matured, transitioning from simple discussions to nuanced, well-informed debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This shift fosters a more holistic understanding of complex topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.

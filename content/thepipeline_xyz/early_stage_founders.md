When dealing with [[earlystage_crypto_investment_strategies | early stage founders]], the concept of [[role_of_leadership_in_startups | leadership]] is often "completely out of question" initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The "Soldier" Mentality

A founder's job is to do "literally everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. They must embody the role of "great great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This means engaging in all necessary tasks, such as:
*   Coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Even cleaning their own chairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Dealing with lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Dealing with accountants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

"Absolutely everything has to be done by the founders initially" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

The advice for [[earlystage_crypto_investment_strategies | early stage founders]] is to "be a great Soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Founders should strive to be such effective "soldiers" that they can "fight a lot of battles on ground" before they [[cofounder_selection_and_team_building | hire soldiers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This hands-on experience teaches them "how to [[cofounder_selection_and_team_building | hire great soldiers]]" later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Path to Leadership

[[Transition from founder to leader | Greatest Founders who became leaders]] eventually did so because they were first "great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. There will be a [[transition_from_founder_to_leader | transition period]] where a founder becomes or "grow[s] into the [[role_of_leadership_in_startups | role of a leader]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While support is available for becoming a leader, there is "hardly any support for people who want to become great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The objective is to foster "greatest of soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, as a "great warrior" will naturally become a "great leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Conversely, a leader who has "never been on the ground fighting those battles" may not be as effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

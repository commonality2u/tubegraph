### Memes and Lore

### Builder Ecosystem
The [[monad community opportunities | Monad community opportunities]] for building are highlighted, with many "OG community members" trying their hand at starting projects on the Monad testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. These include NFT projects, games, and mini-apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. The testnet is considered a "great environment to try things" and experiment with new features, gather user feedback, and amplify coding skills with the help of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>.
The "talent in the community" is recognized as "incredibly high," with strong creativity in art, video creation, and analytical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.

### Specific NFT Projects & Initiatives
*   **Monape**: An "OG project" that started with PFPs drawn live on Discord streams, demonstrating organic community growth and artistic talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:49">[01:41:49]</a>. It has since expanded, with an "insane quality trailer" for a new chapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>.
*   **Blocknuts**: A technical project focused on art and individual traits, which experimented with a raffle ticket system for its testnet mint to avoid botting, demonstrating innovative distribution methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:34">[01:43:34]</a>.
*   **Live Art Incubation Program**: Artists Driy and Amnet partnered with Live Art for a free mints program, supporting [[Monad ecosystem developments | Monad native artists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:23">[01:45:23]</a>.
*   **Mona Moors**: A "super cute" collection with an "unhinged but wholesome energy," which saw significant growth due to community OGs like Gan Turret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>.
*   **Kruxful**: A new project aiming to build a community of collectors to attract artists for small-supply exclusive mints. Its founder, Games, has a deep understanding of the APAC art market and is bringing known artists like Dada to Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:12">[01:48:12]</a>.

## Team and Community Development
The [[Monads team and community development | Monad team and community development]] work closely, with the team actively pushing for infrastructure developments (like USDC, Magic Eden, Phantom Wallet, Uniswap, Wormhole, LayerZero) to make Monad the "best place to build an app in crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. This proactive approach aims to alleviate bottlenecks and allow developers to focus purely on building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. The team sees the community's excitement and builder activity as validation for these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

## Skepticism and Proof of Concept
The community understands the skepticism surrounding new Layer 1s, especially without direct experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. However, the Monad testnet serves as "proof" that the technology works, showcasing high transaction throughput (10,000+ transactions per second) and significant adoption (nearly a billion transactions and 150 million accounts in two months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. The community's "crazy" activity, art creation, and overall enthusiasm act as a signal that "there's probably something there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This long-term vision and collective optimism help counter negative sentiment in the broader crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

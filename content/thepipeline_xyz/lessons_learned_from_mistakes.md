When asked about a [[learning from mistakes | mistake]] that taught an important lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, the interviewee shared an incident from their time at Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. They recounted feeding a family of four raw meat, an action that resulted in disciplinary action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The consequence of this error was being "put on probation with no pay for about two weeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The clear takeaway and [[learning_through_making_mistakes | lesson learned]] from this experience was a commitment to not repeat the mistake: "I would not do that again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

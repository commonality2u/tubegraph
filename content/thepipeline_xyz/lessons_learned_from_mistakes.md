## The Wendy's Raw Meat Incident

When asked about a [[learning_from_past_mistakes | mistake]] that taught an important lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, one individual recalled an incident where they "fed a family of four raw meat one time at Wendys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This action led to being "put on probation with no pay for about two weeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The key takeaway from this experience was a firm resolution: "I would not do that again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

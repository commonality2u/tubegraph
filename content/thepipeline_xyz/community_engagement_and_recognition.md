## Honoring and Engaging Community Members

The speaker often gives "shout outs" to various individuals, including Claire, David, and Thread Guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. There is a desire for continuous engagement, as evidenced by the speaker's question, "where the heck is Mike Webb?" given his activity on Twitter, and his later appearance at position #86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Conversely, there's a noted concern when a member's engagement declines, such as with "Bill Monday," who was ranked #59 and told, "we need you back bill" as he had "lost touch with the [[community_involvement_and_opportunities_in_the_monad_ecosystem | community]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Community Growth and Future

The speaker expresses being "super honored to Vibe with this [[community_involvement_and_opportunities_in_the_monad_ecosystem | community]] every day" and to "welcome more and more folks in over this past year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Despite existing growth, it is believed to still be "incredibly early for manad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, indicating ongoing opportunities for [[building_and_engaging_community_in_crypto_spaces | community building]] and [[community_involvement_and_opportunities_in_the_monad_ecosystem | involvement]].

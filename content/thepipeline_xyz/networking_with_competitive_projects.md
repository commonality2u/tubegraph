During "Monad Madness" in New York, an attendee expressed enthusiasm for [[Collaboration and competition in the crypto space | meeting competitive projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This highlights a focus on engaging with other entities in the space, even those considered competitors.

Another participant similarly noted looking forward to [[networking_and_meeting_builders | meeting all the amazing builders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> present at the event.

Excuses often prevent individuals from pursuing their goals. Common excuses include lacking time or feeling a sense of discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These objections are described as "100% an excuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Common Excuses

Many people express discomfort, such as when speaking to a camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The speaker acknowledges this feeling, noting that they "still do often" and "get hung up all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Excuses are often rooted in fear, uncertainty about where to begin, or the anticipation of discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Addressing these concerns is crucial for [[handling_discomfort | handling discomfort]].

## Just Start

The primary solution to overcoming excuses is simply to "start doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Initial attempts might be "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, but consistent effort leads to [[improving_over_time | getting better]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Embracing Discomfort and Finding Your Way

Even with practice, some challenges may persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, through repeated action, individuals can develop their own methods and processes that lead to comfort and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. While one person's process may not work for another, finding one's own method is achieved "by getting out and doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

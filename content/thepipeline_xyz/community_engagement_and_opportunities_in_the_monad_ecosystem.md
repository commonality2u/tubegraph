The Monad Public Testnet has officially launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, marking a significant moment for the [[growth_and_development_of_the_monad_community | Monad community]] and opening up numerous avenues for [[community_engagement_and_opportunities_in_the_monad_ecosystem | participation]] and [[opportunities_and_careers_in_the_monad_ecosystem | growth]] within the ecosystem.

### Accessing the Testnet
The Monad Testnet landing page is the primary hub for interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Users can access it via:
*   testnet.monad.xyz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   monadtest.phantom.me for existing [[importance_of_the_monad_community | community]] members with a Phantom wallet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

#### Connecting Your Wallet
The first step involves connecting a wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While some wallets offer native testnet support, others may require manual network addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This process is simplified with an auto-add button for MetaMask and other wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

#### Obtaining Testnet Tokens
To engage with the testnet, users will need testnet tokens, obtainable through the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Users can paste their public address and click "get testnet mod" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The amount claimable may vary, and the faucet refreshes daily, encouraging regular checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Initial Engagement Activities
Once testnet tokens are acquired, users can immediately participate in key activities:

#### Making a First Trade
The testnet features three meme coins: Mandac, Makaki, and Chog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These can be traded directly on the landing page via Blinks by Dialect, with transactions powered by Uniswap, a significant day-one deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

#### Exploring dApps and Experiences
The testnet spotlights a variety of decentralized applications (dApps) from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>:
*   **Fantasy Top:** A tournament is scheduled to begin the day after launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Featured Apps:** Other applications prominently featured on the main landing page include Rare Bet Sports, 42 KY, Kuru, and Curv ANS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

#### Ecosystem Directory
An [[investment_and_growth_in_the_monad_ecosystem | ecosystem directory]] is available and will be continually updated throughout the testnet phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This serves as the primary resource for discovering new apps and experiences within the Monad Public Testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. It is recommended to check this page frequently to find [[opportunities_and_careers_in_the_monad_ecosystem | exciting opportunities]] to interact with the testnet and experiment with new dApps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

> [!TIP] Provide Feedback
> A key purpose of the testnet is to test new app experiences in a lower-stakes environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Users are encouraged to try out many dApps and provide feedback to the development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Deeper Community Engagement and [[opportunities_and_careers_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Opportunities]]

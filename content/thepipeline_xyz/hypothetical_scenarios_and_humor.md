[[creative_hypothetical_scenarios | Hypothetical scenarios]] are presented as a means of engaging in creative and introspective discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Humorous Hypotheticals

One example of a [[creative_hypothetical_scenarios | hypothetical scenario]] that elicits humor involves being asked to drink paint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. When faced with the question, "If you had to drink paint, what color would you choose and why?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, the response was "red" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The reasoning provided for this choice was, "because it looks like blood and I thought it would like mix well with my bloodstream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This explanation was then humorously self-corrected as making "zero sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, leading to a decision to "just move on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, which was noted as "funny" by the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Other Hypothetical Questions

Another [[creative_hypothetical_scenarios | hypothetical scenario]] posed was, "If your life was a song, what would the title be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> The answer given was simply, "Just do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, implying a philosophy of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

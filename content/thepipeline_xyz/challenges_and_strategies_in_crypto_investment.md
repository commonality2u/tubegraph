## Introduction to Logan's Background and Investment Philosophy

Logan, managing partner at Frictionless Capital, began his podcast journey about a year and a half ago with the aim of conversing with interesting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He views podcasting as a "life hack" for extended discussions with inspiring individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. His career started in Silicon Valley, notably spearheading the supercharging network on the software side at Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. He admired Tesla for its product building and its approach to the world, particularly its use of first principles thinking, exemplified by the Cybertruck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Logan entered the crypto sphere in 2017 with Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, he grew disillusioned when gas fees reached $1,000 during the 2021 bull market, which led him to seek alternative ecosystems focused on scaling the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. He believes that new infrastructure, such as Monad, offering low transaction fees, high throughput, and unique applications, is essential to onboard the majority of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This perspective informed his decision to start Frictionless Capital, concentrating on these new, high-throughput blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Frictionless Capital's Investment Thesis: High-Throughput Blockchains

Logan's investment thesis at Frictionless Capital centers on high-throughput blockchains. This stance was initially contrarian, especially when Solana was seen by many as "dead" or the "FTX chain" following its implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Despite being "deeply unpopular for a long time," Frictionless Capital believed Solana represented a unique bucket of high-throughput blockchains, which would become a requirement for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

The fund's core belief is in enabling self-sovereignty, private keys, and blockchain functionality for as many people as possible globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. To achieve this, the industry must scale from millions of users to hundreds of millions, then billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This requires significant advancements in infrastructure to support more daily active users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

> [!INFO] Analogy for Scaling
> Logan draws a strong analogy between the evolution of internet connectivity and blockchain scaling:
> *   Going from 56k modems to broadband internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
> *   The "block space" or transaction propagation limit in blockchains is analogous to slow internet connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
> *   Faster, cheaper transactions enable the building of more interesting applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
> This focus on increasing bandwidth and hardware scaling, pioneered by Solana, leads to the conviction that these modern approaches will onboard the vast majority of users and engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

Frictionless Capital closed its fund recently and is now focused on full-time deployment, backing teams that leverage high throughput, including pioneers like Solana, as well as Monad, Aptos, and Sui <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. These high-throughput blockchains enable unique applications that were previously impossible, such as replacing automated market makers (AMMs) with more efficient order books for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Navigating Contrarian Views and Market Cycles

A significant [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_cryptocurrency_investment | challenge in crypto investment]] is maintaining conviction through multiple market cycles, especially when holding a contrarian view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Logan notes that investors and engineers often need to see "a little bit of traction" to believe something will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. For Frictionless Capital, their thesis started to play out towards the end of 2023 with Solana's run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Logan's strategy for retaining conviction involves:
*   **First Principles Thinking:** Approaching the space from fundamental principles, which involves "ripping apart people's arguments and trying to find flaws" in both others' and one's own thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This method was learned and refined during his time at Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Independent Research:** After leaving Tesla, Logan spent a year and a half conducting independent research to understand blockchain architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Focus on Technology's Potential:** He realized that block space was the limiting factor, akin to dial-up internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. His conviction stemmed from the understanding that building more interesting applications requires faster internet connections (higher throughput) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Due Diligence and Identifying Promising Projects

[[challenges_and_strategies_for_crypto_startups | Finding promising projects]] and being skeptical of others is one of the hardest things in crypto investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Many projects are strong in marketing but lack the underlying technology or execution capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Logan's due diligence process involves:
*   **Technical Focus:** Unlike many funds, Frictionless Capital is highly technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Logan prefers to talk with technical co-founders rather than marketing personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   **Honesty about Tradeoffs:** He values engineers who are honest about the engineering tradeoffs they are making, as no solution is maximally efficient at every possible outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. This includes understanding different scaling approaches like Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.
*   **User and Product Impact:** While technical details are crucial, Logan emphasizes that "Tech is not the end game; Tech is the starting point that allows you to build really unique products" that grow the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
*   **Welcoming Criticism:** He appreciates when people highlight flaws in his logic or thinking, as it helps him learn and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Unique Crypto-Only Applications:** Frictionless Capital looks for applications that are only possible within the crypto ecosystem, often enabled by high throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Monad
> Logan was an early believer in Monad, recognizing its legitimacy due to the team's caliber and its potential to parallelize the EVM for high throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. He believes if he could rewrite Ethereum's history, he would design it with parallel processing and high throughput like Monad's architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. Monad's goal is to usher in a new paradigm of applications that can reach mass adoption by providing the necessary "rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. It's described as "Solana-like performance but fully EVM compatible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.

## Key Investment Areas and Future Trends

Logan and Frictionless Capital are particularly excited about:
*   **DeFi 2.0:** Leveraging high-throughput chains to enable native order books and more efficient decentralized finance applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. If blockchain is to move the majority of money globally, it must integrate traditional finance (TradFi) technology stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.
*   **MEV and Payment for Order Flow (PFOF):** Understanding Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is becoming increasingly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. They backed Dlow, a company focused on PFOF, which Logan sees as complementary to Jito's work on the taker side of liquidity and the "next iteration of kind of this MEV structure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs):** This category represents a new way for capital formation and has the potential to enable the first applications with 10 million monthly active on-chain wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. Examples like Helium, expanding into personal cell phone plans, demonstrate how crypto rails can coordinate physical world products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

Logan believes the industry is at the "very early precipice" of a transition to high-throughput blockchains and will enter the "Golden Era of crypto products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. This shift will allow application engineers to focus on product development rather than infrastructure, which is currently a significant drain on their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Crypto Investors

[[crypto_trading_strategies_and_experiences | Navigating the abundance of information]] and distinguishing what's "real" from what isn't is a significant [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_cryptocurrency_investment | challenge in crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Logan offers several pieces of advice:

*   **Embrace Being Wrong:** "Everybody's wrong and your goal is to be less wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Even industry leaders make mistakes, and accepting this helps one grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
*   **Talk to Smart People:** Engage with many smart individuals and actively seek out flaws in your own thinking, as this makes you better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Do Your Own Homework:** There is no "perfect design" or "perfect alpha." Investors must "do your homework and come to your own conclusions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.
*   **Synthesize Information:** Learn from different points of view from engineers and leaders, and synthesize this information to form your own sophisticated understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.
*   **Beware of Bias:** No single individual or entity holds all the information without some degree of bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. The goal is to be less biased and less wrong over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

> [!TIP] Holistic Well-being
> Logan advises prioritizing physical and mental health, especially during bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. He suggests going outside, getting sun, and working out, as one "cannot trade or make money if your mental health or physical health is not there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

## Personal Conviction and Learning

A key lesson Logan has learned in crypto investment relates to [[philosophical_versus_financial_motivations_in_crypto_investment | the dichotomy of being right versus being popular]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. The things that generate financial returns "will not always make you popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. While growing up, he always wanted to be liked, but in investing, being early and right often means holding a differentiated point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Be Right, Not Popular
> If you've done your homework and truly believe in something, even if it's unpopular, you may be right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. It's crucial to "stay the course" while continuously questioning yourself and seeking information that might invalidate your thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. Don't be contrarian for the sake of it, but trust differentiated information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.

Logan shares an anecdote about being rejected by popular venture capital funds before starting Frictionless Capital; many of those same funds are now investors in his firm, reinforcing the importance of self-belief and doing the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.

Kido and The Particle Inc. project are transforming the world into a digital playground by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) in gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:18">[02:38:18]</a>.

## Current Challenges in AR Gaming
Traditional augmented reality gaming faces several key issues:
*   **Lack of Immersion** Gameplay often occurs on a virtual map without real-time interactivity or environmental mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:26">[02:38:26]</a>.
*   **Low Retention** Long-term retention rates typically fall between 5% and 10% after 30 days due to a lack of engaging content, social features, and personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:35">[02:38:35]</a>.
*   **Limited Real-World Interactivity** Current systems lack precise reactions to specific attributes of real-world objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:45">[02:38:45]</a>.

## The Solution: Augmented Unification
Kido's patented technology, "Augmented Unification," blends AR, AI, and blockchain to address these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:09">[02:39:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:23">[02:40:23]</a>. This approach leverages computer vision to give the system a contextual understanding of its environment, including objects and their attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:17">[02:39:17]</a>. This understanding enables immersive gaming and fosters emotional connections with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:34">[02:39:34]</a>.

> [!info] Key Capabilities
> The integration of AI, AR, and blockchain allows for:
> *   **Contextual Awareness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:27">[02:40:27]</a>

This technology aims to build emotionally connected consumers, who are more likely to contribute, spend more (70%), and remain loyal (82%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:37">[02:40:37]</a>.

## Enhanced User Experience
Through this technology, users experience:
*   **Relationships with NFTs** Users build relationships with their [[The integration of NFTs and blockchain in mobile gaming | NFTs]], which react with emotional and physical responses based on player interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:02">[02:41:02]</a>.
*   **Personalization** The digital world learns and grows based on the player's environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:10">[02:41:10]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Gameplay** Gameplay continuously evolves based on the player's real-world locations, creating true immersion and limitless adventure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:17">[02:41:17]</a>.

> [!example] Real-World Applications (Particle Link)
> *   Build and customize a village that travels with the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:32">[02:41:32]</a>.
> *   Tag graffiti messages for others to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:36">[02:41:36]</a>.
> *   Achieve quests using real-world objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>.
> *   Discover and share resources on quests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:44">[02:41:44]</a>.
> *   Utilize real-world attributes to drive the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:49">[02:41:49]</a>.
> *   Battle against the "Ink Army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:53">[02:41:53]</a>.

## Market Opportunity and Adoption
The adoption of AR is seen as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>:
*   **Gen Z Engagement** 74% of Gen Z daily uses AR applications like Google Lens, Ikea, Snapchat, and Sephora Virtual Artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">[02:42:04]</a>.
*   **Device Penetration** There are 1.73 billion AR-enabled smartphones worldwide today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:14">[02:42:14]</a>.
*   **Smart Glasses Growth** Smart glasses are expected to grow by 29% over the next six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:20">[02:42:20]</a>.
*   **Market Inflection Point** The AR AI Market is at an inflection point, ready for explosive growth, with Kido/Particle Link at the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:26">[02:42:26]</a>.

> [!tip] Hardware Evolution
> While currently mobile-focused (iOS and Android) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:15">[02:46:15]</a>, the team is closely following advancements in smart glasses (like Meta's Orion glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:31">[02:47:31]</a> or Quest 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:09">[02:48:09]</a>), which are seen as game-changers for the future of AR immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:40">[02:47:40]</a>. The technology is designed to work with older phones through a custom scanning system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:52">[02:46:52]</a>.

The blockchain integration goes beyond mere [[The integration of NFTs and blockchain in mobile gaming | NFT characters]]; daily gameplay data and character development are stored on the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:41">[02:50:41]</a>. In the future, users will have the option to put their personal data, collected by AI agents learning about their unique environments, onto the blockchain and monetize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>. An ecosystem token is also planned post-product launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:11">[02:52:11]</a>.

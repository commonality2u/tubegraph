Improving over time, particularly in new or uncomfortable areas, hinges on [[overcoming_excuses | overcoming excuses]] and embracing the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Many objections, such as lacking time or feeling uncomfortable, are simply 100% excuses rooted in fear or not knowing where to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This discomfort is a normal part of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Overcoming Initial Hurdles

A common concern, such as feeling uncomfortable talking to a camera, is shared even by experienced individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The speaker still experiences discomfort and gets "hung up" often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Power of Starting

The key to improvement is to simply start doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Initial attempts may be "terrible," as evidenced by older videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, through consistent effort, one begins to [[iterative_improvement_in_skills | get better]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> and gain a better feel for how to deliver, for example, to a camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Developing Your Own Process

With enough practice, individuals figure out their own comfortable and effective methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The speaker's process works for them because they have done it enough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While one person's process might not work for another, each person will find their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The only way to discover this personal process is by actively engaging in the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

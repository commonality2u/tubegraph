The question "what's the [[weird_habits | weirdest habit]] you have" was posed to an individual named Alex, who is from France and works on the ecosystem team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

When asked this question again, Alex found it challenging, stating, "oh wow that's a tough one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Despite further prompting ("any habit yeah got"), he was unable to readily provide an answer, concluding with "I don't know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

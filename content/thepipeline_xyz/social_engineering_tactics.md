## Case Study: Y22 Trader Compromise

A notable trader named y22, who gained significant traction for publicly sharing his successful trading journal, was targeted by a sophisticated social engineering attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The attack led to him losing virtually all his assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The incident began when an attacker posted a link to a fake [[telegram_hacking_incident | Telegram group]] under y22's Twitter thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Upon attempting to "verify" within this [[telegram_hacking_incident | Telegram group]], users were prompted to perform additional steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, which included performing an action on their desktop browser, requiring a transition from phone to desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This browser action, performed where hot wallets were accessible, led to the compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Tactics Used

The perpetrator employed several advanced [[social_engineering_and_phishing_attacks | social engineering]] tactics to execute the attack:
*   **Identity Mimicry**: The attacker mimicked y22's entire Twitter history, follower count, and even created a username similar to his actual Twitter handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Verification Badge Deception**: The fake account also displayed a gold check mark, adding to its perceived legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Scale of Effort

Individuals engaging in such attacks are willing to go to extreme lengths to compromise targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This can include shelling out significant sums, potentially five figures, for [[social_engineering_and_phishing_attacks | social engineering campaigns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A considerable amount of time, effort, and money can be invested to compromise a large number of at-risk individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

> "Don't assume somebody's not willing to shell out like five figures and as somebody who's done like I guess social engineering campaigns as a living like there's a lot of like time and effort and money you can spend to compromise like a ton of people that are at risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

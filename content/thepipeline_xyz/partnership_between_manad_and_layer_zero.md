The first episode of "The Pipeline" Season 2 highlights a significant partnership between [[monad_labs_and_ecosystem | Monad]] and [[layer_zeros_transport_layer_technology | Layer Zero]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This collaboration brings together the CEOs and a co-founder from both protocols to discuss the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Understanding LayerZero

[[layer_zeros_transport_layer_technology | Layer Zero]]'s co-founder and CEO, Brian Peligrino, explains that [[layer_zeros_transport_layer_technology | Layer Zero]] functions as a fundamental transport layer, akin to the internet's TCP/IP stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Just as the internet makes it easy to move data between distributed execution environments, [[layer_zeros_transport_layer_technology | Layer Zero]] aims to connect various blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Its core primitive involves sending a simple packet, or an "arbitrary contract invocation with a bytes array," to run smart contracts and move data between chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This allows different chains to communicate seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Brian recounts the origin of [[layer_zeros_transport_layer_technology | Layer Zero]], initially driven by a desire to build a game across different chains like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. They discovered a lack of coordination mechanisms between contracts on different chains and found existing bridges problematic due to their reliance on "wrapped assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Wrapped assets fundamentally shift risk from liquidity providers (LPs) to the end-user, who holds an IOU that could lose value at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This led to the development of a solution focused on native asset bridging with instant guaranteed finality, which later evolved into [[layer_zeros_transport_layer_technology | Layer Zero]]'s transport layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

## Impact of the Collaboration for Monad

Keone, from [[monad_labs_and_ecosystem | Monad]], emphasizes that the team is "extremely excited" about collaborating with [[layer_zeros_transport_layer_technology | Layer Zero]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. He states that seamless interoperability between different ecosystems is crucial for the decentralized world to "eat the centralized world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. With existing applications, capital, and data on other chains, it's vital for these environments to communicate seamlessly and trustlessly to deliver the best user experience and powerful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Different blockchains may excel at different things, and a single interoperability layer is essential for the future of decentralized tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

For [[monad_labs_and_ecosystem | Monad]] specifically, which starts as a new environment, it's incredibly important to have a robust, trustless mechanism for users and assets to move over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. This partnership makes it easier for users to explore [[monad_labs_and_ecosystem | Monad]] without worrying about logistical hurdles, enabling new kinds of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

## Solving Real-World Problems

Both Brian and Keone discuss how crypto, and by extension their collaboration, addresses pressing real-world problems:

*   **Self-Sovereignty and Financial Disruption:** Brian highlights the early crypto thesis of self-sovereignty and permissionless access to finance, viewing it as a disruption to the traditional banking and financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The ability to create more interesting financial primitives broadly useful to the world is a significant disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Payments:** Keone identifies payments as a "killer app" for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. He points out the high fees credit card companies charge (e.g., 3% per transaction), which burdens businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Crypto offers a way for anyone with a phone to pay for services, avoiding middlemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This requires networks like [[monad_labs_and_ecosystem | Monad]] to transact at the scale of current payment systems, with [[monad_labs_and_ecosystem | Monad]] aiming for 10,000 transactions per second throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Personal Finance:** Keone suggests that making DeFi the standard for personal finance—including banking, trading, borrowing, and lending—holds significant potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This demands systems that offer equal or better user experiences than centralized tools, requiring reduced slippage and execution costs to single-digit basis points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Reduced Friction and Centralization Risk:** Brian notes the "trillion dollar business" of Visa and Mastercard, representing a significant tax on businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. He highlights unnecessary friction in current systems, such as high currency exchange fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. With a shared global state and high execution for transactions, crypto can remove much of this friction and protect against single-entity failure or corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs)

Brian describes Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs) as a solution for issuers who manage assets across multiple chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. Historically, moving assets like Tether between chains was a "nightmare," involving external bridging providers and often resulting in wrapped assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. OFTs enable assets to be handled directly through the contract itself, eliminating the need for external bridging providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

With OFTs, an asset issuer can maintain full security over the contract, allowing for transfers of large sums (e.g., $100 million of Tether) for the cost of gas, potentially as low as one-tenth of a penny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. This near-zero friction for asset movement and inventory management significantly improves capital efficiency, enabling arbitrage across chains at sub-cent spreads and fostering more efficient and fair markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## Monad's Parallel EVM and its Role

Keone discusses [[monad_labs_technology_and_innovations | Monad's technology]] and its [[monad_labs_technology_and_innovations | parallel EVM]], a feature that has recently gained significant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The original vision for [[monad_labs_and_ecosystem | Monad]] was to build a more performant version of Ethereum's execution and consensus, aiming for a "much better engine for decentralized smart contracts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

Their profiling revealed that the biggest bottleneck in existing Ethereum clients was state access, primarily due to the inefficient state database (LevelDB) used by clients like Go Ethereum (Geth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. To address this, [[monad_labs_and_ecosystem | Monad]] embarked on building a new custom database that natively stores Merkel tree data in an optimized structure and supports asynchronous reads and writes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. This enables parallel access to different regions of the Merkel tree, allowing many virtual machines to run transactions in parallel much more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. This engineering effort, driven by performance benchmarks, is what makes [[monad_labs_and_ecosystem | Monad]]'s [[monad_labs_technology_and_innovations | parallel EVM]] a significant innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

Brian praises [[monad_labs_and_ecosystem | Monad]]'s approach, noting that technical people recognized its potential early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. He considers Keone the "Godfather of the [[monad_labs_technology_and_innovations | parallel EVM]]" for pursuing this challenging problem as a Layer 1 solution, long before it became a popular narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

## Future Vision: Synergy and User Experience

Brian believes in a "multi-chain future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. He clarifies that [[layer_zeros_transport_layer_technology | Layer Zero]] is agnostic to validation methodologies, focusing purely on the transport layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. With its V2 release, [[layer_zeros_transport_layer_technology | Layer Zero]] allows other perceived competitors to exist within its framework as validation sets, promoting synergy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Brian envisions [[layer_zeros_transport_layer_technology | Layer Zero]] becoming an invisible underlying layer, similar to how developers don't think about TCP/IP when building internet applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

Keone is excited about a "renormalization of what we think of as normal" in crypto costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. He highlights current issues like high gas fees (e.g., $20 per transaction) and significant slippage (1-5% or even 10-20% for meme coins) as deterrents for new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. He cites Solana's low fees as an example of what's possible, allowing users to make trades for fractions of a cent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. This reduction in transaction costs will enable a new wave of applications and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. Developers will also no longer need to excessively optimize for gas, allowing them to include more defensive assertions and improve protocol security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

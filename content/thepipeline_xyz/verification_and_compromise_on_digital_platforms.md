## Case Study: Trader Y22

A notable trader known as y22, who gained traction by posting a successful trading journal, was compromised through a sophisticated social engineering scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Compromise Method
The attack began when someone under y22's Twitter thread posted a link to a Telegram group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Upon joining the Telegram group, users were prompted to verify their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This verification involved additional steps that required users to perform an action on their desktop browser, transitioning them from phone to desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Performing this action on the desktop browser, where the victim's hot wallet was located, led to the compromise of the wallet and the loss of nearly all assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Attacker Tactics
The individual who posted the malicious message employed several deceptive tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>:
*   They mimicked y22's entire Twitter history and follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   Their username was made similar to y22's actual Twitter handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   They also displayed a gold check mark on their profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Broader Implications
Attackers are willing to go to extreme lengths and invest significant resources to compromise individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It should not be assumed that a perpetrator would hesitate to spend five figures on such a campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Substantial time, effort, and money can be expended in social engineering campaigns to compromise a large number of at-risk individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

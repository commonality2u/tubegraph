Instead, it is recommended to move as quickly as possible and concentrate on refining one small detail with each iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This iterative approach allows for substantial improvement because it encourages rapid execution and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

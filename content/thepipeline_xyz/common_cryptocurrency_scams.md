One prevalent type of scam in the cryptocurrency space is the [[common_attack_vectors_in_crypto | address poisoning attack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This attack preys on the user's attention to detail and familiarity with their transaction history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Address Poisoning Attacks

An address poisoning attack occurs when a malicious actor monitors a user's cryptocurrency transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The attacker then sends a small transaction to the victim using an address that closely mimics one the victim frequently uses, such as their own wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### How it Works

The deceptive addresses are crafted to appear very similar to legitimate ones, often matching the first and last few characters of the intended address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Due to how some platforms display addresses (e.g., truncating the middle characters), these subtle differences can easily go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

If a user is not paying close attention, they might mistakenly copy this fake address from their transaction history, believing it to be their own wallet's address or a trusted recipient's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This often happens when users are sending funds between their own wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The user then accidentally sends a large amount of money to the attacker's address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Consequences

Individuals have lost significant amounts of money due to these attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

> [!TIP] Prevention

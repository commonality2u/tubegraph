Crypto startups face significant hurdles, from navigating volatile market conditions to finding sustainable business models and gaining mainstream adoption. The journey often requires long-term vision and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.

## Market Volatility and Funding
Operating within a crypto bear market presents distinct difficulties for builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. An initial miscalculation for one founder involved trying to raise less money at a lower valuation in a bull market, hoping to return later without a massive "down round" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. However, this strategy failed as market narratives changed, and initial investors were not willing to provide more funding later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

A key lesson learned is to:
> [!tip] Funding Strategy
> Raise as much capital as possible at any valuation during favorable market conditions, then spend it according to the company's needs rather than investor expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. Investors typically expect funds to be used over 12-24 months, but founders should manage resources to progressively become leaner as market appetite shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

Being at the whim of market narratives and macroeconomic conditions can severely impact a startup's ability to continue raising funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>.

## Finding Product-Market Fit and Combating "Dev Fatigue"
One major [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_new_applications_in_crypto_and_blockchain|challenge in building and adopting new blockchain technologies]] is the difficulty in clearly communicating a product's purpose when it aims for a holistic solution across multiple ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. In a market where attention is paramount, declining interest makes it harder to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

The rise of meme coins has introduced a unique challenge:
> [!caution] Dev Fatigue
> "Dev fatigue from meme coins is very real. You have very talented people looking at this saying like 'oh my God like I could manufacture this make $5 million in like two weeks like why am I working so hard on this real product?'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>

This sentiment highlights a significant hurdle for builders creating legitimate products, as they compete with quick, often unsustainable, profits from speculative assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. The strong narrative around meme coins can be extraordinarily disheartening for those doing what they consider legitimate work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

Another [[challenges_in_the_cryptocurrency_gaming_sector|challenge]] is that while concepts like isolated tokens on-chain representing unique assets (e.g., a tractor with tracked maintenance and ownership history) hold real-world value, the crypto market currently shows little interest in these applications, favoring speculative "jpegs" or meme tokens instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

## Sustainable Business Plans and Real-World Application
For a crypto startup to succeed, founders need a business plan that ensures sustainability for themselves and their team for a long-term horizon, ideally 10+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. This contrasts with traditional startups, which often aim for profitability or public offering much later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

Key advice for founders, as part of [[advice_for_crypto_founders_and_market_focus|advice for crypto founders and market focus]]:
> [!tip] Business Model and User Growth
> While user growth is crucial, relying solely on it and postponing a business model is risky unless the scale of users is "freaking massive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. A "cash cow" or bridge revenue model is important while building a user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.

Additionally, startups must consider how they will secure funding for a decade, whether through venture capital, token liquidation, or other means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. Without a sustainable funding path, the likelihood of failure is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.

> [!warning] Avoiding "Zombie Tokens"
> A concern exists that many projects raising money via tokens might eventually run out of funds, leading to "scores upon scores of zombie tokens" where the team has exhausted their initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.

There is a call for crypto projects to focus on "doing something real" rather than being solely based on memes or pump-and-dump schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>. This includes:
*   Developing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.
*   Creating app layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
*   Building financial derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   Putting real goods on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

The ideal approach is to leverage crypto tools to disrupt existing industries that need innovation, rather than solely building for the insular crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. For such applications, the crypto element should be completely invisible to the end-user, providing a seamless experience akin to typical website registration or mobile authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. Founders should come from or deeply understand the industry they aim to disrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. Otherwise, the industry risks fulfilling the prophecy of crypto haters who call it a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

Initial work on [[comparison_between_different_blockchain_platforms | blockchain]] projects at Jump Crypto, particularly with Solana DeFi, highlighted a significant need for more performant blockchains in general, and specifically for a more performant [[performance_and_scalability_of_evm_chains | EVM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>. Existing [[optimizing_evm_implementations | EVM implementations]] were observed to be inefficient and lacked the level of optimization seen in high-frequency trading systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:18">[01:47:18]</a>.

Direct interaction with both Solana and Ethereum revealed a noticeable difference in performance between the two platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:25">[02:23:25]</a>. While Solana has undergone many optimizations, there are still further improvements that can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>. However, the [[performance_and_scalability_of_evm_chains | EVM space]] presented a substantial opportunity for optimization, which ultimately inspired the creation of Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:20">[02:36:20]</a>. The background in building high-performance systems for trading was considered ideal for tackling the challenge of optimizing EVM performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:19">[02:00:19]</a>.

The [[sour_candy_challenge | sour candy challenge]] is a segment where participants consume a sour candy immediately before answering a series of rapid-fire questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This adds an element of difficulty and entertainment, influencing the participant's demeanor and reactions during the interview.

## The Challenge Format

Before the questions begin, the participant is given a sour candy to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The host asks if they are ready before commencing the questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

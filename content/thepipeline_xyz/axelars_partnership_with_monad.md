This article discusses the collaboration between [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] and [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology | Monad Labs]], highlighting the motivations, benefits, and future implications of this partnership for cross-chain interoperability.

## Introduction to Axelar and its Role in Interoperability

[[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] is an interoperability network structured as a blockchain that connects 56 different blockchains and counting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Founded by Georgios and Sergey, who previously were part of the founding team of the Algorand blockchain, [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] addresses the scalability and security issues prevalent in earlier centralized bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Georgios was inspired to enter the blockchain space by Bitcoin's censorship-resistant financial system, particularly during Greece's financial crisis when sending remittances was nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

[[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] is designed as a messaging platform rather than a simple bridge, allowing the creation of cross-chain applications like DEXs, money markets, and NFT marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Its key differentiators include:
*   **Many-to-many connectivity**: As a central blockchain, [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] enables a single connection point to access all other connected blockchains, unlike competitors that often offer only pairwise connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Decentralization and Security**: Built on the Cosmos SDK, [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] has a fully decentralized validator set of 75 validators, making it almost as secure as the chains it connects to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This mitigates the common attack vector seen in centralized bridges, which have resulted in billions in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. Additional security layers include rate limiting and joint approval mechanisms, as seen with Lido's decision to use both [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] and Wormhole for asset minting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

## Why Monad? The Partnership's Genesis

The inspiration for [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]]'s design, and a key reason for its excitement about [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | Monad]], stems from the challenges faced when launching Algorand, particularly onboarding users and developers to a new virtual machine and dealing with liquidity silos on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The need for robust bridging infrastructure that goes beyond simple asset transfers to improve user experience became evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

The partnership with [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | Monad]] has been in discussion for almost two years, initiated by a mutual investor, [[investment_and_financial_backing_for_monad | Dragonfly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

### Technical Alignment
[[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] sees strong technical alignment with [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology | Monad]]. [[introduction_to_monad_for_developers_and_users | Monad]]'s high throughput, EVM compatibility, and instant finality are crucial for building efficient cross-chain applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
> "Monad's instant finality is actually crucial for building cross-chain applications because today one of the limiting factors of some of these cross chain message passing use cases is that nobody wants to wait like 20 minutes for a command to be passed... when you're building like these message passing use cases on chains with instant finality such as [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | Monad]], the messages are much faster, right? It could be anywhere between like 60 to 90 seconds so the the user experience is substantially better." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>

### Community and Developer Demand
The strong community excitement and demand from builders are significant factors. Developers consistently ask [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] when they will launch on [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | Monad]], making it evident that [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] needs to be present on [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | Monad]] as soon as possible, ideally from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

## Impact and Future Outlook

The collaboration between [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] and [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | Monad]] is poised to significantly impact the blockchain ecosystem.

### Enhanced User and Developer Experience
[[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] enables developers building on [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | Monad]] to have the "brain" of their application on the fast EVM chain while allowing users from other networks to interact seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This means users won't need a separate bridging step; an application can, for example, directly accept USDC deposits from Arbitrum and open a position on [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This "plug and play" approach reduces application logic complexity and prevents liquidity fragmentation by bringing users to the [[developments_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

[[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]]'s Interchain Token Service (ITS), currently in beta, further enhances this by providing a code-free, permissionless tokenization and bridging solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This allows anyone to launch a token that is cross-chain from day one with robust security, illustrated by partnerships with projects like Frax Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

### The Future of Cross-Chain Applications
While asset transfers currently dominate cross-chain use cases, the industry is moving towards a future where interoperability is embedded in every application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. As gas costs decrease and new chains launch daily, cross-chain transactions will scale exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
> "I think everything we see today on a single chain there will be a cross-chain version of it and on top of that there'll be like new unique use cases that we haven't really even thought of yet." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>

The conversation among builders has shifted from being single-chain focused to planning multi-chain deployments from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. In this future, users ideally won't need to be aware of which specific blockchain an asset or application resides on, with wallets abstracting away the complexities using interoperability infrastructure like [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

The collaboration between [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] and [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | Monad]] was publicly announced on the podcast release date, marking an early commitment from [[axelars_role_and_vision_in_blockchain_interoperability | Axelar]] to support [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

## Final Alpha: Conviction and Community

The "Final Alpha" shared emphasizes the importance of conviction in technology and a strong community in the long run of crypto, rather than chasing short-term narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.
> "Ignore the noise if you're in it for the long run and look for projects with amazing Tech and a very uh strong community." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>
[[monads_team_and_community_development | Monad]] is highlighted as an example of a project possessing both strong technology and a dedicated community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. For founders and individuals in the space, maintaining personal convictions amidst market hype is deemed critical for sustained focus and building in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

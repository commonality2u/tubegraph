The primary challenge in [[gaming_and_crypto_integration | gaming]] is the creation of an enjoyable game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Some developers prioritize adding [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | on-chain]] asset tracking before focusing on game quality, which is seen as less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The preferred approach is to first develop a fun game and then integrate [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | blockchain]] components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The integration of [[blockchain_gaming_and_nfts | NFTs]] with platforms like Roblox is considered sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This is because Roblox was established as a game first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, aligning with the idea of building a strong gaming foundation before adding [[blockchain_gaming_and_nfts | blockchain]] elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Traditional [[gaming_and_crypto_integration | gaming]] communities already engage in informal trading of in-game assets, such as CS:GO skins or the RuneScape gray market for gold, which has existed for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. These traditional trading methods often involve insecure practices like wire transfers to unknown individuals, leading to scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While less secure than [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | crypto]], these activities highlight an existing demand for digital asset ownership and exchange within [[gaming_and_crypto_integration | gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

A notable trader known as y22, who gained significant traction by sharing his trading journal, became the victim of a sophisticated scam that led to the loss of all his assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This incident highlights the critical importance of [[verifying_cryptocurrency_wallet_addresses | verifying]] communication channels and exercising extreme caution online.

### Modus Operandi of the Attack

The scam involved a highly deceptive impersonation and a multi-stage process designed to compromise the victim's digital assets:

*   **Twitter Impersonation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>: The attacker created a fake Twitter account that mimicked y22's online persona, including their entire Twitter history, follower count, and a similar username <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The imposter also displayed a gold check mark, adding to the illusion of legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Malicious Telegram Group** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>: The imposter posted a link to a Telegram group under y22's legitimate Twitter thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Forced "Verification" and Device Switch** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>: Inside the Telegram group, users were prompted to undergo a "verification" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This verification included additional steps that eventually directed users to perform an action on their desktop browser, requiring a switch from phone to computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Hot Wallet Compromise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>: The action performed on the desktop browser, where the victim's hot wallets were accessible, directly led to the compromise of their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. As a result, y22 lost nearly everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### The Extent of Attacker Dedication

This case illustrates the extreme lengths to which malicious actors will go to compromise individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Attackers are willing to invest significant resources, potentially "shelling out like five figures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, and dedicate substantial time and effort to social engineering campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The goal is to compromise a large number of at-risk individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not assume that an attacker is unwilling to invest significant resources to compromise you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Always verify communication channels independently and be wary of unsolicited links or demands for "verification" that require actions on your personal devices, especially where cryptocurrency wallets are stored.

The [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] public testnet is now live, offering an array of experiences for users from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Accessing the Monad Testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
Users can access the testnet via testnet.monad.xyz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. For existing [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] community members, an alternative entry point is monadtestnet.phantom.me for a Phantom wallet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Connecting Your Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
To begin, connect your wallet to the testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Some wallets provide native testnet support, while others may require manual network addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Manual addition is simplified by a button that auto-adds the testnet to MetaMask or other compatible wallets in one step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Obtaining Testnet Tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
Testnet tokens are available through the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Users can paste their public address into the faucet and click "Get Testnet MOD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The amount claimable will vary based on certain parameters, and the faucet refreshes throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Making Your First Trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
Once testnet MOD tokens are acquired, users can make their first trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Three meme coins are available:
*   The House of Mandac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   The House of Makaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   The House of Chog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

These coins can be bought directly on the landing page, powered by Blinks by Dialect and Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Ecosystem Directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

This directory serves as the primary resource for discovering new apps and experiences on the [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] public testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

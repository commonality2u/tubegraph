In the context of [[early_stage_founders | early stage Founders]], the concept of "leadership" is initially considered secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The primary focus for founders is on executing all necessary tasks to build the company from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Founder as a "Great Soldier"

Contrary to popular belief, the most effective path to becoming a leader in a startup is by first being a "great soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This means the founder's initial role is to perform "literally everything" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

Examples of a founder's initial responsibilities include:
*   Coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Handling administrative tasks like cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Engaging with lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Dealing with accountants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

> "Absolutely everything has to be done by the founders initially" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

By fighting "a lot of battles on ground" personally before hiring staff, founders gain critical practical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This hands-on experience is crucial for understanding how to effectively [[cofounder_selection_and_team_building | hire great soldiers]] later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Transition to Leadership

Only after having served as a "great soldier" does a founder typically undergo a [[transition_from_founder_to_leader | transition period]] to "become a leader or grow into the role of a leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The speaker suggests there is ample support available for this transition, but less so for the initial phase of becoming a "great soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

A "great warrior" who has experienced the challenges on the ground is more likely to become a "great leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Conversely, a leader who has "never been on the ground fighting those battles" is considered less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This underscores the importance of practical, hands-on experience as a prerequisite for effective leadership in startups.

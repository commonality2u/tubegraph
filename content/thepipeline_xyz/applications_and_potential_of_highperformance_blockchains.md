The launch of the public testnet for [[movement_labs_and_highperformance_blockchains | Monad]] marks a significant moment, showcasing the underlying technology and signaling the beginning of a new phase for high-performance blockchain systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. While some perceive testnet or mainnet launches as the finish line, for Monad, it's considered the starting line for continuous innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Driving Force Behind High Performance
Building a performant blockchain from scratch provides greater technical control over the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>. This approach allows for specific implementations regarding memory allocation and disk interaction, which might be restricted by forking existing open-source projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

Existing Ethereum clients have focused on areas like state sync performance rather than raw execution throughput because Ethereum is arbitrarily rate-limited to maintain low node requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. In contrast, Monad was envisioned as a [[the_future_of_highperformance_blockchains | high performance]] EVM chain with no design restrictions other than 100% EVM compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:09">[04:21:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The goal was to maximize network and hardware [[optimizing_blockchain_performance | performance]] while targeting consumer-grade nodes costing around $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. This undertaking requires highly specialized low-level system engineers, who are typically found in big tech, silicon manufacturing, or high-frequency trading firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

### Key Innovations
The main [[optimizing_blockchain_performance | innovations]] in Monad revolve around concurrent execution and optimizing database access to keep the machine constantly busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Most existing clients are single-core, which doesn't fully leverage modern multi-core machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. While transactions in a block have dependencies, the challenge is to pipeline them, working on multiple transactions simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

A critical component is the database: waiting for disk access, which takes microseconds, adds up quickly across many transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. By building its own database, Monad minimizes CPU idle time, ensuring the CPU is always performing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. This is likened to a "washing machine" analogy where multiple loads are processed in parallel through different stages (wash, dry, fold) to maximize throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

## Unlocking New Applications
[[the_importance_of_high_throughput_blockchains | High throughput]] blockchains provide shared global state, acting as an environment for anyone to build and distribute applications to millions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. This includes built-in payment rails and programmability, enabling users to leverage existing on-chain assets and digital identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

Specific verticals benefiting from [[the_importance_of_high_throughput_blockchains | high throughput]] and [[the_future_of_highperformance_blockchains | high performance]] include:

*   **High-Fidelity DeFi:** Scaling personal finance to hundreds of millions of users with extremely low transaction fees and reduced slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. Efficient markets enable liquidity providers to compete down spreads on fully on-chain exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
*   **Consumer Space:** Applications targeting consumers that [[need_for_performant_blockchains | need to scale]] to hundreds of millions of users, requiring throughput exceeding a billion transactions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN):** Enabling price-sensitive applications where a fraction-of-a-cent cost to push data to chain can unlock new business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:00">[38:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>. Examples include marketplaces for health data or data from various consumer devices like compute (CPU/GPU) or cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:18:00">[39:18:18]</a>.

Monad's approach is a bet on application builders leveraging this performant infrastructure layer, recognizing that crypto adoption is consistently increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.

## Differentiating True Performance
When benchmarking performance, it's crucial to distinguish between simple token transfers and complex real-world transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>. Ethereum history replay is used to simulate diverse, real-world usage patterns, including complex DeFi protocols (AMM, lending) and expensive ZK proofs, rather than just simple token transfers or ERC20 transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>.

There is a concern about misleading marketing in the space, where projects might manipulate benchmarks by using geographically co-located nodes, small numbers of nodes with high hardware requirements, or misrepresenting stake weight distribution to show inflated performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:14:00]</a>. Monad intentionally tests worst-case scenarios, such as highly stake-weighted nodes in different global locations, to optimize for robust decentralization and [[performance_and_scalability_of_blockchain_systems | scalability]] without violating the laws of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>.

## The Public Testnet and [[future_of_decentralized_applications_and_high_throughput_ecosystems | Future of Decentralized Applications and High Throughput Ecosystems]]
The Monad public testnet is a "Showcase of the technology" and the applications built on top of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:00">[33:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:45:00">[33:45:00]</a>. It serves as a testing ground for various usage patterns that are hard to simulate internally, such as high-stress NFT mints or 100,000 concurrent users performing many transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>. The goal is to observe how the system handles reaching its limits, ensuring it degrades gracefully rather than failing outright or providing poor user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.

The testnet will attract a new group of users who primarily interact with crypto on-chain, providing them the first opportunity to experience Monad's innovations firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:55:00">[46:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:09:00">[47:09:00]</a>. This public availability is anticipated to drive significant growth in the ecosystem, attracting more builders and allowing existing teams to refine their products with real user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>.

### The Unpredictable Side
While some new applications are predictable (e.g., more efficient DeFi), the most exciting aspect is the unpredictable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a>. Just as nobody predicted YouTube or Instagram from the early internet, [[the_future_of_highperformance_blockchains | high performance]] infrastructure could enable entirely new types of applications that are currently unforeseen, such as advanced AI agents interacting on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:13:00">[43:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>. The combination of speed, cost-efficiency, and EVM compatibility will empower developers to push the boundaries of what's possible in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:00">[43:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:53:00">[43:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:01:00">[44:01:00]</a>.

## Ongoing Innovation
For Monad, the public testnet is not the culmination, but the beginning of an extensive roadmap of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:04:00">[50:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:09:00">[50:09:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Further optimizations based on public feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:00]</a>.
*   Rewriting existing components for even better [[optimizing_blockchain_performance | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>.
*   Integrating new features for usability, privacy, and increased decentralization (e.g., supporting thousands of nodes to match Ethereum and Solana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:16:00">[49:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:26:00">[49:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>.

This long-term vision, rooted in years of experience in high-performance systems, emphasizes that delivering a performant, EVM-compatible base layer is just the initial step to unlock a broader set of use cases and foster widespread crypto adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:00">[50:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:06:00">[51:06:00]</a>. The project rejects the notion that "technology doesn't matter" or that simple forks with new marketing are sufficient, instead focusing on fundamental technological innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:41:00">[51:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:19:00">[52:19:00]</a>.

It is crucial for any business owner to understand the necessity of [[importance_of_sharing_your_business_message | getting your message]] and product out to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. If you are building something of value, it is imperative to share it with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Challenge of Humility

Naturally, many humble individuals may feel reserved or hesitant to brag about their accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While this sentiment is understandable, it is a barrier that must be [[overcoming_excuses | overcome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. At some point, you *must* share what you are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Why Sharing is Essential

Sharing your work is vital for several reasons:

*   **Attracting a Market** If you expect to attract any type of market, people need to be aware of what you offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Building Trust** People need to be able to [[building_trust_through_transparency | trust you]], especially within the [[building_a_personal_brand_in_crypto | crypto]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Strategies for Getting Started

If you're unsure where to begin, consider the advice often given by Gary Vaynerchuk:

> [!TIP] Just start [[benefits_of_documenting_your_business_journey | documenting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
> Begin vlogging and documenting your activities, as this content can be utilized later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Alternatively, simply talk about what you are working on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Addressing the Fear of Idea Theft

Many individuals fear that if they share their ideas, someone else will steal them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. However, it's important to recognize:

> If an idea is truly good, someone else is likely already working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The advantage lies with the person who first starts talking about and sharing their work publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This individual will establish themselves as a key authority or the person who genuinely understands the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Therefore, the sooner you can speak out and share, the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

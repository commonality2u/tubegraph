Phishing and [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | social engineering]] are common tactics used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These methods often exploit human vulnerabilities rather than technical ones.

## Case Study: Ronin Network Hack

A notable example of a [[risks_associated_with_phishing_and_social_engineering_attacks | phishing]] and [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | social engineering]] attack is the compromise of the Ronin blockchain company, known for its popular game Axi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

*   **Initial Compromise**: A devops engineer at Sky Mavis, Ronin's parent company, was [[risks_associated_with_phishing_and_social_engineering_attacks | phished]] with a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The engineer reportedly clicked an executable file received as part of this fake job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Key Acquisition**: This single point of failure allowed the attacker to gain access to the engineer's device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. From there, through [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | social engineering]], they were able to obtain four keys for a multi-signature wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A multi-signature wallet functions like a door requiring multiple keys to unlock it; in this instance, five out of nine keys were needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Lateral Movement**: The attackers then performed "lateral movement," transitioning from the compromised engineer's device to another system to acquire a fifth key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Massive Exploitation**: With all five required keys, the attackers successfully compromised the system, leading to what may be the largest hack in history, resulting in approximately half a billion dollars in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This extensive damage originated from a seemingly innocuous office email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Abstract is a new blockchain chain being developed with a primary focus on consumer adoption and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:07">[03:50:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:09">[09:07:09]</a>. The project aims to bridge the gap between complex blockchain technology and everyday consumers, identifying key issues in the current landscape that hinder mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:07">[03:50:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:07">[03:50:07]</a>.

## The Vision Behind Abstract

The core idea behind Abstract is that consumer and blockchain are not currently synonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. For mass consumer adoption, a blockchain experience must be curated, personalized, and customized, with the right features and positioning for the end user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:07">[03:50:07]</a>. Luca, CEO of Pudgy Penguins, believes that traditional blockchain teams often lack the understanding of how to build for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:18">[04:17:18]</a>. Abstract seeks to support builders by providing unique solutions to the "distribution problem" – helping applications find product market fit in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:09">[04:26:09]</a>.

## Key Problems Abstract Aims to Solve

Abstract is designed to address several pain points in the current blockchain ecosystem:

*   **Fragmentation of Features** Current blockchains often excel in specific areas, but lack a comprehensive suite of features needed for a true consumer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:33">[03:57:33]</a>. For example, ZK Sync might have the best account abstraction, Base the cheapest fees, and ARB amazing tooling for physical-to-digital bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:33">[03:57:33]</a>. Abstract aims to combine these essential elements in one place to avoid compromises that could hinder mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:04">[04:06:04]</a>.
*   **Lack of Consumer-Building Expertise** Many blockchain teams are excellent builders from a technical standpoint but fall short in community building and understanding consumer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>. Abstract will support builders with insights into consumer product development and go-to-market strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:09">[04:26:09]</a>.
*   **Overemphasis on Technical Innovation** While technical innovation is crucial, there's a perceived lopsidedness towards it, at the expense of branding, marketing, and community talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:51">[04:16:51]</a>. Luca argues that the next breakthrough for L2s will come from being cultural hubs with strong communities, relevant cultural products, and effective distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:02">[04:31:02]</a>.
*   **Broken User Flows** Many promising crypto products have low user adoption due to convoluted user journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Abstract intends to provide guidance to fix these critical user flow implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:08">[05:27:08]</a>.

## Abstract's Strategic Approach

Abstract's strategy leverages the existing strength of the Pudgy Penguins brand and a deep understanding of consumer markets:

*   **Leveraging Community and Culture**: The Pudgy Penguins brand already possesses a strong community and a unique culture, which Luca believes is a significant competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. This established base provides a cultural hub for the new chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:02">[04:31:02]</a>.
*   **Focus on UX/UI Innovation**: A majority of the innovation for Abstract will come from the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. The team acquired the Frame team to bolster their capabilities in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   **Cultural Shift in L2s**: Luca aims to lead a cultural shift within the L2 world, focusing on the "right way" to build L2s that prioritize consumer needs and adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:15">[04:22:15]</a>.
*   **Direct Alignment with Builders**: Luca plans to actively work with builders on Abstract, offering his expertise in consumer products, go-to-market strategies, and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:17">[05:17:17]</a>. This direct alignment ensures that the learnings from Pudgy Penguins and prior businesses are applied to help new applications succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:08">[05:43:08]</a>.

## Abstract's Target Ecosystem

The new chain will host all Pudgy Penguin products outside of the NFTs themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:04">[04:43:04]</a>. The goal is to attract a nucleus of builders from existing and unlaunched ecosystems to pioneer a consumer crypto revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

Abstract is specifically designed for consumer adoption and breakthrough viral consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, not for general DeFi protocols or maximizing Total Value Locked (TVL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Luca states that for those building defi mechanisms or high-throughput blockchains, other chains like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base might be better suited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. The focus is solely on mass adoption and product market fit for the "regular person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## Crypto Industry's Current Challenges and Path Forward

Luca argues that crypto currently suffers from a branding and marketing problem, with too many projects trying to reinvent the same wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:02">[04:54:02]</a>. He emphasizes the need for more time, energy, and resources to be dedicated to branding, marketing, and building "true and genuine communities" that are not fleeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

He contends that the industry needs more marketers, branders, and narrative specialists, rather than solely focusing on developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. While technological infrastructure is largely in place and functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:32">[05:31:32]</a>, the pervasive "Normie narrative" that crypto is just a "perpetual casino" hinders broader growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:08">[05:43:08]</a>. For crypto to reach its full potential, it must become the backbone of economies, moving beyond mere speculative trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:08">[05:43:08]</a>.

> [The competitive advantage] is slowly but surely moving towards Community culture and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

> I think crypto has a branding and a marketing problem and everyone just still trying to reinvent the same wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:02">[04:54:02]</a>. We don't need more developers, we need more marketers, more branders, more positioning guys, more narrative guys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

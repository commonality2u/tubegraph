[[introduction_to_multifactor_authentication | Multi-factor authentication]] (MFA) involves using a second method to verify an individual's identity beyond a password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

One such method is biometric authentication, which utilizes unique physical characteristics to confirm identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. A common example of a biometric method used for [[introduction_to_multifactor_authentication | MFA]] is Face ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Other methods of [[introduction_to_multifactor_authentication | MFA]] include:
*   [[hardware_keys_in_multifactor_authentication | Hardware keys]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   [[authenticator_apps_and_best_practices | Authenticator apps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   [[risks_of_using_text_message_codes_for_authentication | Text message codes]], though these are considered a very dangerous method due to increased vectors for compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

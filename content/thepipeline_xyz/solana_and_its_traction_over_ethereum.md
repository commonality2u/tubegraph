Solana has demonstrated significant traction, particularly when compared to Ethereum, driven by its performance advantages and improving user experience. This shift reflects a broader market dynamic where users are prioritizing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in blockchain interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>.

## Solana's Resurgence and Performance Advantages

Despite being "called stupid" throughout the year by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:03">[06:00:03]</a>, [[Solana and its role in crypto airdrop season | Solana]] has experienced a rapid price increase and regained significant market share. The recovery began quickly after the industry was "hit in 2022" following events like the FTX collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:07">[03:19:07]</a>.

Key performance advantages cited for [[Solana and its role in crypto airdrop season | Solana]] include:
*   **Cost-effectiveness**: Users can perform actions at "one/100th of the cost" compared to Ethereum mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:14">[07:01:14]</a>.
*   **Speed**: Transactions are "10x faster" than on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:02">[07:04:02]</a>.
*   **User Experience**: Solana offers a generally better user experience due to its speed and lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:30">[06:58:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:04">[20:59:04]</a>.

This has led to [[Solana and its role in crypto airdrop season | Solana]] flipping Ethereum in 24-hour Dex volume and NFT trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:47">[06:50:47]</a>. The "Soul E chart is literally just up only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:54">[07:27:54]</a>, demonstrating its strong relative performance.

## User Allegiance and the Need for Scalability

One significant factor driving [[Solana and its role in crypto airdrop season | Solana]]'s traction is the observation that "nobody has any allegiance to any chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:06">[22:45:06]</a>. If the user experience is better and applications are competitive, users will migrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:19">[22:58:19]</a>.

> "What are they going to think about using Eth versus Solana versus Arbitrum versus Optimism they don't care they don't know what any of those words even mean they don't care... they're just just going to use like whatever the best apps are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:15">[23:22:15]</a>

The need for high [[Performance needs in decentralized finance | performance]] and [[Importance of technology and scalability in blockchain ecosystems | scalability]] for mass adoption is critical. Ethereum L1 currently handles about "1 million transactions per day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>. For an app to reach the top 10 on an app store, it might need "a million daily active users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:07">[24:22:07]</a>, potentially generating "50 million transactions per day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:40">[24:43:40]</a>. This highlights the need for chains that can support massive transaction throughput without high costs, a niche [[Solana and its role in crypto airdrop season | Solana]] has effectively filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:30">[25:51:30]</a>.

## Narrative Battle and Mass Adoption

The crypto space has faced a "narrative battle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:26:47">[35:26:47]</a>, with some dismissing entire segments like NFTs as scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:50">[36:35:50]</a>. However, [[Solana and its role in crypto airdrop season | Solana]] is seen as having "a ton of real fundamental value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:25">[18:00:25]</a> and the ability to "enable in the real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:01">[18:05:01]</a>.

The challenge is distinguishing legitimate projects from those purely driven by speculation or social signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:03">[17:16:03]</a>. The influx of new participants, often without deep technical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>, means that "price action is the best marketing tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>, even if it blurs the lines between real value and hype.

## Application-Driven Growth and User Onboarding

The next phase of crypto growth is expected to be driven by applications ("apps become main character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>), particularly those that are easy to use and provide clear benefits without requiring users to understand underlying crypto complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:20">[23:30:20]</a>.

Examples of [[Onchain elements and technology used in Monad Games | Solana]]-based applications leading this charge include:
*   **Drip House**: A free NFT platform on [[Solana and its role in crypto airdrop season | Solana]] that allows artists to release art weekly using [[Solana and its role in crypto airdrop season | Solana]]'s compressed NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:27">[30:46:27]</a>. It's an effective onboarding mechanism where users start with drip and then explore other [[Defi ecosystem | DeFi]] applications on [[Solana and its role in crypto airdrop season | Solana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>. Being free removes the "scamming" perception risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:53:30">[38:53:30]</a>.
*   **Parallel**: A game focused on reaching web2 users who can play without needing a crypto address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:24">[37:51:24]</a>. Players can later realize they can "buy the actual in-game assets as NFTs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>, providing a "Trojan horse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a> approach to crypto adoption.

## Broader Industry Trends

While [[Solana and its role in crypto airdrop season | Solana]] leads in demonstrating high throughput, other areas like [[EVM compatibility and innovation | EVM compatibility and innovation]] and modular blockchain designs are also competitive. Celestia, for instance, focuses on being a "modular data availability layer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:36">[21:35:36]</a>, aiming to reduce costs for rollups on Ethereum. Ethereum's EIP-4844 is also expected to make transactions cheaper for rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:40">[22:21:40]</a>.

The "L1 trade is going to keep working" as long as these blockchains offer advantages in cost, speed, and user experience over Ethereum mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:07">[21:07:07]</a>. The competition between L1s and L2s for user onboarding will be "hugely competitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[Future potential and scalability in the crypto space | future potential and scalability in the crypto space]] hinges on the [[development and technical innovation in blockchains like Solana and Monad | development and technical innovation in blockchains like Solana and Monad]] that can support consumer-facing applications at a massive scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>.

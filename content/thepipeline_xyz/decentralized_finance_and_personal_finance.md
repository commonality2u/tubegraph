Decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto aim to address significant real-world problems, particularly through the lens of foundational technologies like LayerZero and [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Core Thesis: Self-Sovereignty and Permissionless Access

The initial drive into crypto, particularly from 2013 onwards, was fueled by a strong libertarian viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This perspective held that traditional banks were irresponsible with money and the global financial state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The concept of [[self_sovereignty_and_financial_independence | self-sovereignty]] emerged as a powerful tool, emphasizing the ability for individuals to have full control over their money, pay anyone they wish, and interact permissionlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The early thesis for the space was to disrupt money itself, along with the traditional banking and financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. With the advent of Ethereum and programmable smart contracts, the technology evolved to enable the creation of much more interesting [[innovations_in_decentralized_finance | financial primitives]] and structures that can be broadly useful to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This disruption of finance and money is considered a "big enough problem to solve," which in turn unlocks numerous other empowering possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Key Applications and Problems Solved by DeFi

### Payments
Payments represent one of the clearest applications for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

*   **Addressing Credit Card Fees**: In the Western world, credit card companies charge "huge fees" (around 3%) on every transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This amounts to a "massive cost" for businesses, both small and large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The combined market caps of Visa and Mastercard, valued at approximately a trillion dollars, highlight the significant "tax" taken from businesses through these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Crypto offers a way for individuals to pay for services directly with their phone, bypassing these intermediaries and their fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Global Adoption**: In parts of the world where credit cards are less common, crypto, particularly Tether, is already widely used for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Personal Finance
Beyond payments, [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | DeFi]] holds significant potential for personal finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

*   **Decentralized Banking and Trading**: The goal is to make DeFi the standard for personal finance, encompassing banking, trading, borrowing, and lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Improving User Experience**: To achieve this, DeFi systems need to deliver an experience that is at least equal to, or ideally better than, centralized personal finance tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This includes reducing slippage, improving execution costs, and making the cost of trading on-chain comparable or superior to centralized environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Performance Requirements**: Reducing slippage from 1-5% (frequently seen in DeFi) down to single-digit basis points requires a highly [[performance_needs_in_decentralized_finance | performant environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This allows market makers to quote tightly, compete down spreads, and offer a much better execution experience for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Settlement
More broadly, crypto can improve settlement processes for all kinds of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This includes:
*   Settlement for stock trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Transfer of assets like houses or cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Meeting the Demands of a Decentralized Future

For crypto to truly disrupt existing payment and financial systems, it needs to transact at the same scale as current payment processing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Monad]] aims to be that network, boasting a throughput of 10,000 transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This high performance is crucial for the [[impact and future potential of decentralized applications and defi | future potential]] of [[challenges_and_innovation_in_decentralized_finance_defi | decentralized finance]] to provide a superior user experience and achieve widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

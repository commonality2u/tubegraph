Decentralized health data platforms address critical issues within the traditional healthcare system, primarily focusing on data silos and user sovereignty. These platforms aim to give individuals control over their medical information, enabling secure sharing and even monetization.

## Core Problems Addressed
Traditional healthcare systems suffer from deeply siloed medical records, meaning that hospitals and providers often do not communicate with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. This fragmentation is particularly problematic in emerging economies, where public health systems are stressed, hindering efficient patient treatment as data cannot move freely between institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>. This systemic issue costs an estimated $200 billion globally and leads to over 30,000 lives lost annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>.

Beyond operational inefficiencies, the centralization of health data poses significant privacy and security risks. A notable example is the 2023 23andMe hack, which resulted in the exposure of 7 million patient records, including sensitive genomic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:48">[01:45:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>. Centralized platforms are vulnerable to such breaches, highlighting the need for more secure, user-controlled alternatives.

## Ever Network: A Decentralized Solution
Ever Network proposes a decentralized healthcare data storage protocol, built on the Monad blockchain, to solve these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>. Its core principle is to return data ownership to the users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.

Key features and functionalities include:
*   **User Data Sovereignty** Users can own their data, deciding precisely where it is stored, who accesses it, and how it is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>.
*   **Secure Storage** The platform is built on an encrypted layer of IPFS, ensuring data security and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.
*   **Chatbot Functionality** A chatbot allows users to interact with their own data, for instance, inquiring about symptoms without needing to consult a doctor, thereby avoiding misleading information from general web searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:49">[01:44:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>.
*   **[[Monetization of Health Data]]** Ever Network is developing pathways for users to monetize their health data. This involves licensing data to pharmaceuticals, insurance companies, and drug researchers, allowing users to get paid for its usage and even be recruited for clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Traction and Go-to-Market Strategy
Ever Network originated as a SaaS company in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>. It has secured government contracts, including with the Thai government, for medical record management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The network currently spans over 650 hospitals and manages more than 10 million patient records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:53">[01:49:53]</a>. There are also new contracts with the Indonesian government and plans for expansion into Colombia and partnerships with Japanese hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:56">[01:58:56]</a>.

The go-to-market strategy is three-pronged:
1.  **B2B Partnerships** Expanding the hospital network globally, especially in emerging economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.
2.  **Web3 User Engagement** Empowering users to leverage data from wearable devices (e.g., Aura Ring, Whoop, Apple Watch) to earn rewards for providing lifestyle data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>. This strategy targets web3 natives, who are perceived as more health-centric and interested in quantifying themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
3.  **Physical Activations** Implementing physical activations, such as retina scans, to onboard users into the application directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>.

While existing data is held by the originating hospital with private keys, the future vision is to move towards patient-held private keys to enhance user control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:37">[02:17:37]</a>. The focus for patient acquisition initially targets individuals with chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes who require long-term data tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>.

## Role of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Health Data
Primus, a cryptography technology provider, highlights the importance of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) in ensuring data privacy and security in decentralized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:20">[02:21:20]</a>. Specifically, ZK-TLS enables verification of data flow from Web2 to Web3, while ZK-FHE (fully homomorphic encryption) allows for verifiable computation on encrypted data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:30">[02:23:30]</a>. This technology is seen as crucial for supporting applications that require verifiable and authenticated data, such as healthcare systems, ensuring that only valid data enters the system and can be exchanged or traded securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## Pulse: Wearable-Powered Health Data Network
Pulse is building a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) powered by native wearables to aggregate health data and enable its monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:20">[02:30:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:17">[03:19:17]</a>. Pulse aims to allow users to share their data with third parties in exchange for rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

Key aspects of Pulse:
*   **Data Aggregation** Collects health data from various devices including wearables, DNA, blood work, and health records, then encrypts it on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **User Control** Users own their data through an inbuilt hardware wallet, ensuring that private keys are held only by the user, and Pulse itself cannot access the data without permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>. This emphasizes a "privacy-first" and "decentralized on day one" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10">[03:35:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:16">[03:35:16]</a>.
*   **Data Market** The health data market is substantial, projected to grow from $69 billion to $540 billion over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This growth is driven by AI applications, longevity research, personalized healthcare, and self-care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:31">[03:32:31]</a>.
*   **Monetization Process** Third parties can bid to acquire data from Pulse users on-chain. Users receive notifications in the app and can choose to accept or deny the offer. If not enough users accept, the third party must make a better offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:01">[03:39:01]</a>. The data shared with companies is anonymized, ensuring personal identifiable information is not revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:30">[03:39:30]</a>.
*   **Productivity Focus** The Pulse wearable tracks metrics like sleep, heart rate, calories, and energy levels, capable of predicting fatigue and suggesting recommendations for productivity enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Early Traction** Pulse achieved $150,000 in sales in 21 days, selling out three waves of its product, primarily to crypto-native users in the Monad ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:20">[03:35:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:15">[03:37:15]</a>. They also conducted a fitness competition with over a thousand Monad community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

To maintain the [[security_of_cold_wallets | security of cold wallets]], it is crucial to properly manage your recovery phrase or keys. You should always back up your recovery phrase or keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Key Storage Guidelines

*   **Offline Storage** Never put your recovery phrase or keys online, as this would completely defeat the purpose of having a [[security_of_cold_wallets | cold wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Physical Medium** Store them in a safe place on a piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Secure Environment** Ideally, stow them away in something that is fireproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Known Location** Place them in a location where you know exactly where they would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

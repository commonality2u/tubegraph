The co-founder of Backpack, Tristan, highlights that the initial inspiration for Mad Lads, a prominent NFT project, centered on [[importance_of_community_in_the_nft_space | building community]] and fostering a strong group of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. This approach emphasized finding the "best people" from a broad base of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Building a Core Community through Mystery and Engagement

The process began with a unique, unannounced marketing strategy. Key individuals in the Solana ecosystem changed their Twitter usernames to include "xnf" (e.g., "xnf Anatoli"), generating widespread mystery and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This organic buzz led to the Backpack Twitter account gaining approximately 10,000 followers in its first month without any paid promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

To consolidate this energy, a private Discord server was created, serving as a hub for back-and-forth conversations and the foundation of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Invitations to this exclusive Discord were extended based on user contributions such as quality memes, insightful content, or the potential to be a strong contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. A specific GIF of an anime girl throwing a blue dodgeball became a public signal for an invitation, triggering a "Cambrian explosion of memes" as people sought to emulate behaviors that granted access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. This curated approach resulted in a core group of 500 to 600 "hardcore chronically online crypto addicts and meme masters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## The Role of Memes and Shared Experiences

A significant cultural element that emerged was the "blue ball meme" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. This meme captured both the "blue dodgeball" GIF used for invites and the community's anticipation (and frustration) as Backpack kept details about xNFTs under wraps. This viral meme further fueled engagement and entertainment within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

### Integrating Product with Community

A crucial realization for Backpack was that product and technological innovation alone were insufficient; the community needed to feel genuinely integral to the project's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Drawing an analogy to Satoshi Nakamoto and early cyberpunks, Tristan emphasizes that the intersection of product and culture is what enables long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. To sustain this energy, the team decided to launch an NFT collection, Mad Lads, with the initial core Discord members forming its "cultural backbone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. These individuals were deeply aligned with Backpack's vision and ethos, and to this day, continue to maintain the community's culture as it expanded to over 30,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

The Backpack wallet itself was leveraged as a tool for [[community_engagement_and_influencers | community engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. Early beta testers of the wallet were granted a whitelist for the NFT collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. Games were integrated into the locked wallet interface, allowing users to win invite codes by guessing AI-generated image prompts, animal sounds, or navigating Minecraft maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. These interactive experiences fostered a deeper connection, motivating users to genuinely care about the project beyond mere financial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.

### The "Doomed to Success" Philosophy

Tristan explains that a strong community is vital for distribution in crypto, calling it a "cult" built through genuine participation in the project's story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. This approach of allowing people to feel part of the narrative creates a subconscious desire to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.

He emphasizes that taking oneself too seriously is a "doomed to failure" strategy in crypto, as Crypto Twitter largely drives the narrative and requires an entertainment component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>. Success hinges on a balance between serious development and a playful, meme-oriented culture that resonates with both "left curve" (mainstream/less informed) and "right curve" (deeply informed) audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:50:00">[43:50:00]</a>. The internal philosophy of "no utility, this is a rug, send it to zero" for Mad Lads intentionally set low expectations, encouraging people to "just vibe" and "enjoy the journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:45:00">[46:45:00]</a>.

### The Synergistic Triangle

Backpack operates as a synergistic triangle:
1.  **Mad Lads:** Serve as the "top of funnel," acting as both "super fans" and "super users" who provide significant attention and rigorous product testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Backpack Wallet:** The non-custodial wallet manages the user's on-chain journey across Solana and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>.
3.  **Backpack Exchange:** The centralized exchange handles the user's off-chain journey, designed for seamless interaction with the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:53:00">[28:53:00]</a>.

This integrated approach allows Backpack to curate a cohesive on-chain and off-chain experience for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>. Unlike many exchanges that aim to keep users contained within their centralized experience, Backpack actively encourages users to explore the on-chain world, ideally using their wallet as the primary interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>.

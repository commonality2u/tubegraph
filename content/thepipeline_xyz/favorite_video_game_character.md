## Alex's Choice
When asked to choose any character from a video game to be, Alex, an individual working on the ecosystem team, would pick Mario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The primary reason for this choice is that Mario has been a "pal" for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Alex's initial gaming experiences began on a Nintendo Entertainment System in the 1980s, playing with Mario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Monad Games, a unique content experiment by The Pipeline, the [[developments_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad ecosystem]], and the Monad community, incorporated several innovative onchain elements and technologies to enhance engagement and provide a [[behind_the_scenes_of_monad_games_production | behind-the-scenes]] experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Overview
The initiative aimed to be fun and engaging, bringing together original community members and contributors from the [[developments_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad ecosystem]] to compete in various challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Beyond the physical games, significant effort was put into integrating onchain components, making it a "first-of-its-kind content experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Prediction Markets
Prior to the full episode's premiere, [[Monads HighPerformance Blockchain Features | prediction markets]] were made live on the [[Monads HighPerformance Blockchain Features | Monad testnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. These markets were provided by Opinion Labs, described as a "super super awesome prediction market product building on top of the Monad protocol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The purpose of leveraging this product on the [[Monads HighPerformance Blockchain Features | Monad testnet]] was to generate community energy and speculation regarding the Monad Games challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## The Cipher Challenge
### Development and Features
A significant onchain activation was the surprise cipher challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This cipher, a hidden message embedded within the Monad Games video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, was a concept designed by Jessup to create an onchain component where users could submit guesses to crack it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.

The engineering team at Monad Foundation developed a sophisticated application for this challenge, utilizing "ZK and some cool onchain features" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. Key contributors included Harpaul, Marcus, Box, and Mo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>. The design made it impossible for participants to simulate the cipher offchain and use bots to submit guesses, a common practice in simpler onchain ciphers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. This complexity was achieved through "pretty cool stuff going on behind the scenes with ZK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, making it intentionally very difficult to crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

### User Participation
The community enthusiastically participated in the cipher challenge, submitting "over 30,000 guesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, totaling 43 unique guesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>. Although the challenge was designed to be difficult and it was expected to last longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>, someone managed to crack it relatively quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. For participating, users who submitted a guess received a valueless testnet NFT as a commemoration of their involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>.

## Future Implications
The success of these onchain integrations in Monad Games contributes to the broader goals of [[development_and_technical_innovation_in_blockchains_like_solana_and_monad | development and technical innovation in blockchains like Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>. The project served not just for entertainment but also as a practical demonstration of building novel applications on the [[Monads HighPerformance Blockchain Features | Monad testnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. Future iterations of Monad Games are ambitious, aiming to involve more community members and [[featured_applications_and_experiences_on_monad_testnet | ecosystem projects]] on a larger scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

The Monad public testnet is officially live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Users can now engage with various applications and experiences available from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Getting Started on the Monad Testnet

To begin, navigate to the [[monad_testnet_introduction_and_setup | Monad testnet landing page]] at `testnet.monad.xyz` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. For those using the [[integration_of_phantom_with_monad_testnet | Phantom wallet]], a specific experience is available at `monad.testnet.phantom.me` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

#### Wallet Connection
The first step is to [[connecting_and_using_wallets_for_monad_testnet | connect your wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While some wallets offer native testnet support, others might require manual network addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This process is simplified with an auto-add button, allowing users to add the testnet to wallets like MetaMask in a single step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

#### Acquiring Testnet Tokens
Once connected, users need to obtain testnet tokens via the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This is done by pasting your public address and clicking "get testnet Mon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The amount claimable may vary based on parameters, and the faucet refreshes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Initial Experiences and Applications

With testnet tokens in hand, users can make their first trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The landing page features three meme coins: Mandac, Makaki, and Chog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These can be purchased directly on the page, powered by Blinks by Dialect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> and leveraging Uniswap for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Beyond initial trades, a multitude of experiences are available:

*   **Fantasy Top**: A tournament is scheduled to begin shortly after the testnet launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Featured Apps**: The main landing page highlights several applications, including:
    *   Rare Bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
    *   Sports 42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
    *   KY Kuru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
    *   Curv ANS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>

### Ecosystem Directory and Community Engagement

A significant resource for exploring the Monad testnet is the ecosystem directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This directory will be continuously updated throughout the testnet phase, providing information on new apps and experiences for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. It is the primary location for discovering new activities on the Monad public testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Users are encouraged to revisit this page frequently to stay informed about new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Users are encouraged to interact with various decentralized applications (dApps) and provide feedback to the development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:03:00]</a>. The testnet's purpose is to facilitate the deployment and testing of new app experiences in a lower-risk environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Community involvement is highly encouraged, with significant [[monad_testnet_insights_and_community_projects | community momentum]] expected around Monad and its ecosystem projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. There are ample [[opportunities_and_careers_in_the_monad_ecosystem | opportunities]] for individuals to contribute and build, whether as artists, technical contributors, developers, video creators, or thought leaders in the Monad ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:32]</a>.

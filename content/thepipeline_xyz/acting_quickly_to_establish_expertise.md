To succeed in business, it is crucial for founders to proactively disseminate their message and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. If you are developing something valuable, it's imperative to share it with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Overcoming Reluctance

Many individuals, especially those with a humble demeanor, may feel hesitant to "brag" about their achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While this sentiment is understandable, it's a barrier that must be overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Sharing what you are doing is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Building Trust and Attracting a Market

To attract any market, people need to be able to trust you, a principle particularly significant in fields like cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The "Idea Theft" Fallacy

A common concern is that sharing an idea might lead to it being stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. However, if an idea is truly good, it's highly probable that someone else is already working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The individual who is the first to openly discuss and share their work will establish themselves as an expert or the leading authority on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Therefore, the quicker you begin communicating your work, the more advantageous it will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

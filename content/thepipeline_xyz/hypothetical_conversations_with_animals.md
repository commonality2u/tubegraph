## Rudest Animal Species
In a [[creative_discussions_about_fictional_scenarios | creative discussion about fictional scenarios]], it was suggested that if animals could talk, the giraffe would be the rudest species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The reasoning provided was that the giraffe seems like a "man animal" and possesses characteristics that could lead to rude interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The speaker admitted to being "very rude with that animal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, contributing to the [[hypothetical_scenarios_and_humor | humor]] of the scenario.

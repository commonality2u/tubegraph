AI is playing an increasingly crucial role in the verification and computation of data, particularly within the blockchain ecosystem, to enable more sophisticated and data-driven applications.

## Challenges with Onchain Data
Currently, onchain data is limited, primarily consisting of transactions, addresses, and balances. This scarcity restricts developers from building advanced data-driven or consumer applications. Bringing data from Web2 to Web3 often involves complex cryptographic algorithms, which can be a barrier for developers [02:22:15].

## Primus: A Cryptographic Layer for Secure Data Intelligence
Primus (formerly "P" as in "P-dot-one") aims to address these challenges by building a cryptographic layer for secure data intelligence [02:23:03]. The project connects authenticated, high-value data from Web2 to Web3 and AI applications in a trustless and secure manner across different platforms [02:23:09].

Primus offers two core capabilities:
1.  **Data verification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:22">[02:23:22]</a>
2.  **Data computation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>

### Core Technologies
The foundational technologies behind Primus include:
*   **MPC TLS (Multi-Party Computation Transport Layer Security)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:30">[02:23:30]</a>
*   **ZK TLS (Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:36">[02:23:36]</a>
*   **ZK FHE (Zero-Knowledge Fully Homomorphic Encryption)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:36">[02:23:36]</a>

ZK TLS allows for the verification of data flow from Web2 to Web3. Primus's protocol is noted to be significantly faster than existing solutions like TLS Notary, boasting a 10x speed improvement [02:24:00]. ZK FHE enables verifiable computation on encrypted data, with Primus claiming breakthroughs that improve processing time by more than 300 times compared to alternatives like Zama's [02:24:12].

### Functional Focus Areas
Primus concentrates on four key functional areas to enable data-driven and consumer applications throughout the data lifecycle:
*   **Onchain data verification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:32">[02:24:32]</a>
*   **Confidentiality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:34">[02:24:34]</a>
*   **Enterprise-level solutions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:34">[02:24:34]</a>
*   **Confidential AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:36">[02:24:36]</a>

### Short-Term and Long-Term Goals
In the short term, Primus is focused on providing data verification capabilities through a standard protocol for developers [02:24:47]. This enables the creation of applications such as:
*   Digital goods marketplaces on Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:57">[02:24:57]</a>
*   Verifiable data marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>
*   Prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:03">[02:25:03]</a>

Primus plans to open-source its development to foster community growth and is open to co-hosting hackathons to drive innovative applications [02:25:11]. Long-term, the project aims to deploy standalone solutions like FHE payments and FHE VMs for [[Potential Intersection of AI and Blockchain | confidential AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:26">[02:25:26]</a>.

The company plans to provide SDKs to support various use cases, including onchain data on-ramping and data marketplaces [02:27:46]. This is particularly relevant for applications needing authenticated data, such as Ever Network's decentralized healthcare data platform [02:28:10]. The long-term vision involves focusing more on ZK FHE to compute over encrypted data [02:28:29].

## Other Applications
The broader application of AI in data extends to creating [[AI agents in blockchain stress testing | AI agents]] for the future, leveraging authorized onchain data and decentralized data protocols [02:16:45]. This indicates a future where AI plays a role in managing and utilizing verifiable, real-world data within blockchain environments.

For instance, Totem, an AI deep-in network, aims to unlock the value of daily conversations [03:39:58]. Their device captures voice data, converts it into real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, then encrypts it using Zero-Knowledge Proofs to create anonymized datasets. These datasets can be uploaded onchain via Monad's fast throughput and exchanged for tokens, enabling users to monetize their voice data [03:41:11]. This demonstrates AI's role in processing and verifying real-world data for privacy-preserving monetization.

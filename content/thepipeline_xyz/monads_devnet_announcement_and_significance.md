The announcement of Devnet marked a significant milestone for Monad supporters globally, kicking off Season 3 of The Pipeline podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This development is considered a very important and unique achievement within the EVM landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Eunice, Monad's co-founder and COO, joined the podcast to discuss Devnet and future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## What is Devnet?

Devnet is defined as a fully functioning blockchain environment specifically designed for the Monad blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It represents an "incredible milestone" for the team, as it signifies the unification of two years of crafting and deeply optimizing various parts of the blockchain stack across execution and consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Devnet brings together all four of Monad's technical stack optimizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, marrying key modules such as:
*   The consensus engine (MonadBFT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   The execution engine, which enables parallelized execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   Their interactions through MonadDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>

This results in a fully functioning, cohesive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Who Can Use Devnet?

Devnet is currently an internal core team environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This means it is not yet accessible to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The next public-facing milestone will be [[monads_plans_for_testnet_and_mainnet | Testnet]], which will be phased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Devnet's Headline: 10K TPS on the EVM

One of the major headlines surrounding Devnet is its achievement of 10,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS) on the EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Monad's Definition and Measurement of TPS

TPS is often confusing and misleading due to a lack of a universal, standardized measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. It can be easy to boost this metric using simplified environments or transaction data, such as simple transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Transactions vary significantly in complexity; some are computation-intensive, while others, like transfers, are very quick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Creating a TPS metric solely based on simple transfers can lead to an artificially high "theoretical TPS" or "maximum TPS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. However, transfer-only scenarios do not reflect real-world blockchain data, which involves complex transactions from smart contracts and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Monad measures "real TPS" by using real historic Ethereum data to replay transactions on the Monad blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This approach provides a more realistic and accurate view of true blockchain performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The use of recent Ethereum transaction data is crucial to emulate a current blockchain environment, as early Ethereum primarily saw simple transfers, unlike today's complex smart contract interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This method allows Monad to demonstrate its performance optimizations in an EVM environment using real-world activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This highlights [[monads_key_innovations]].

## Devnet's Role in Monad's Go-to-Market Strategy

Devnet is the first of many exciting milestones for Monad this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. It serves as an internal "dog fooding" process, allowing the core team to identify the existing system's strengths and areas for further optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. As a software company, Monad emphasizes iterative improvements through code development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Subsequent milestones will continue to show improvements to the Monad blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Monad's Development Journey and Future Outlook

Reflecting on the past 16 months, Monad started as a small, heavily engineering-focused team of about seven people a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. The initial phase involved extensive whiteboarding and architecting a complex system while maintaining EVM compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

This period also saw significant [[monads_team_and_community_development]]:
*   **Team Growth**: Monad began as a remote company to find talent globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Around 14 months ago (early 2023), they established a physical presence in New York, starting with a small WeWork office for two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This grew to a 25-person office, and now they occupy an entire floor in Nomad, New York (north of Madison Square Park, coincidentally sharing letters with Monad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The in-person presence has greatly benefited engineering, ecosystem, and business development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Community Expansion**: Alongside team development, there has been "huge development" of the Monad community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Bill is noted as a core part of building the community's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The community's creativity is evident in artwork, themed nails, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Development**: Monad has engaged in productive conversations with project teams interested in multi-chain expansion to the Monad ecosystem, as well as new crypto teams looking to build Monad-native applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. The shift in conversations from "why an L1?" to "what are your plans for Testnet?" indicates growing understanding of Monad's vision for a high-performing L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

The [[development_journey_of_monad]] over the past year has been rapid and exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Many learned about Monad during a challenging market period but quickly understood the necessary optimizations it brings to push the space forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The community's vibrancy and addictive nature fostered strong connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

Looking ahead, Monad remains focused on the goal of launching a strong [[monads_plans_for_testnet_and_mainnet | Mainnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. The team continues to grow across engineering and ecosystem support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The Monad blockchain is considered the "skeleton," with applications, tooling, and infrastructure as the "muscles and tendons," but the community is the "beating heart" that brings it to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

Future [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | initiatives]] include:
*   Increased physical presence at conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>
*   Potentially hosting Monad's own events in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>
*   Discussions around hosting a hackathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>

Monad aims to maintain a continued presence within the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>, with growing recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Community Engagement and Swag

For community members excited about Monad swag, new designs and merchandise will be available in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Attendees at conferences can often find team members carrying a small handful of swag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. For those unable to attend events, continued engagement with The Pipeline and updates will provide opportunities to acquire new merch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Many within the Monad team, including Keone, are frequently seen wearing Monad apparel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.

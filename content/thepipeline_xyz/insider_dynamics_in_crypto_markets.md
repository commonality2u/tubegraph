Average cryptocurrency users often view new token launches as "scams" or "Insider driven" narratives, believing that these mechanisms primarily benefit the already wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perception stems from the feeling that even when genuine opportunities arise, the average user lacks the chance to participate early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## User Resentment and Market Shift

A significant amount of resentment and momentum has built up among crypto users regarding how new coins are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This dissatisfaction leads users to withdraw from traditional crypto markets and instead invest in what they perceive as "more honest" alternatives, such as meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### The Appeal of Meme Coins

Meme coins are increasingly popular because they are seen as free from insider influence, offering a "very Level Playing Field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The primary reason users purchase meme coins is their frustration with "getting dumped on by insiders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Users believe they can "play our own game" in these environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The ongoing popularity of meme coins may eventually compel insiders within the crypto space to adopt more transparent and equitable practices, as they will realize they are directly competing against the perceived fairness of meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This shift in user preference is a market truth driven by the desire for [[building_trust_in_the_market_especially_in_crypto | fairness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

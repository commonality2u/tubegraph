The [[monad_public_testnet_launch | Monad Public Testnet]] is now live, marking a highly anticipated moment for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide outlines the initial steps to engage with the testnet on day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Accessing the Testnet

To begin, navigate to the [[monad_public_testnet_launch | Monad Testnet]] landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. You can do this by visiting:
*   `testnet.monad.xyz` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   For a dedicated [[integration_of_phantom_with_monad_testnet | Phantom Wallet]] experience, go to `monad.testnet.phantom.me` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

## Connecting Your Wallet

The first step on the landing page is to connect your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   Some wallets offer native testnet support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   For others, you may need to manually add the network, which is simplified by an "Auto Add" button that allows you to add the testnet to wallets like Metamask in one step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## [[acquiring_and_using_testnet_tokens | Acquiring Testnet Tokens]]

Once connected, you will need to get `testnet Monad` tokens via the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Paste your public address into the faucet and click "Get Testnet Monad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   The amount claimable varies based on parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   The faucet refreshes daily, so check back often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Making Your First Trade

With `testnet Monad` in your wallet, you can make your first trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

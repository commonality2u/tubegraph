For [[early_stage_founders_and_leadership | early stage Founders]], the concept of leadership is often initially "out of question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The most critical, yet counterintuitive, approach for them is to focus on executing every task themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Founder's Initial Role: The 'Great Soldier'

A founder's primary responsibility is to handle "literally everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The most successful founders who eventually [[transition_from_soldier_to_leader | became leaders]] did so because they were exceptional "soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This hands-on involvement includes:
*   Coding personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Selling the product themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Even tasks like cleaning their own chairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Dealing with legal and accounting matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

> "Absolutely everything has to be done by the founders initially." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

The advice for aspiring leaders, therefore, is to embrace the role of a "great soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. By becoming proficient at fighting many battles on the ground independently, founders gain the practical experience necessary to understand how to effectively hire other "soldiers" later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Path to Effective Leadership

There will be a [[transition_from_soldier_to_leader | transition period]] where the founder grows into the role of a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While there is ample support available for developing into a leader, there is significantly less support for individuals aiming to become "great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The belief is that a great warrior naturally evolves into a great leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Conversely, a leader who has never engaged in the hands-on, ground-level battles is considered "not very great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This underscores the [[importance_of_handson_experience_for_leaders | importance of hands-on experience for leaders]].

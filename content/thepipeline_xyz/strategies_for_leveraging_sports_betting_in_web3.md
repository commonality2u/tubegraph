The landscape of sports betting is undergoing a significant transformation with the integration of Web3 technologies, aiming to address the limitations of traditional and early crypto-based platforms. Lever.BET, a project in this space, highlights several strategies to leverage Web3 for an enhanced betting experience.

## Addressing Current Challenges in Sports Betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:40">[02:26:40]</a>

Traditional and initial Web3 betting platforms face several critical issues:
*   **Lack of Transparency**  Many popular products are merely crypto payment rails built on opaque, or even malicious, standardized casino SDKs, offering no clear insight into their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:51">[02:26:51]</a>.
*   **Low Liquidity** Existing platforms often struggle to accommodate large bets, making it difficult for professional bettors to place significant wagers, such as $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">[02:27:06]</a>.
*   **Limited User Participation** There's a notable absence of avenues for users who wish to engage with the product in a meaningful way without directly participating in sports betting or casino activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:15">[02:27:15]</a>.
*   **Lack of Innovation** The industry has seen a predominant trend of simply [[innovations_and_unique_features_of_rarebetsports_compared_to_traditional_models | copy-pasting Web2 casino models]] into a Web3 format, failing to introduce genuine new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>.

## Web3 Solutions for Sports Betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:39">[02:27:39]</a>

Lever.BET proposes a new paradigm for sports betting by integrating core Web3 principles:

*   **Full Transparency** All aspects, from liquidations to odds, are fully on-chain. This prevents any alteration of payouts or bets by the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:44">[02:27:44]</a>.
*   **Passive Earnings for Liquidity Providers** Users can contribute liquidity to the platform without directly engaging in betting. This allows them to earn profits from the collective activity, akin to [[mass_adoption_of_mobile_gaming_in_web_3 | passive earnings]] from a stablecoin vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:58">[02:27:58]</a>. This vault is designed to be highly profitable and resistant to negative P&L in randomized tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:17">[02:37:17]</a>.
*   **Pooled Liquidity** By adopting a model similar to GMX or HMX, the platform can offer substantial liquidity, overcoming the previous limitation of low betting volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:08">[02:28:08]</a>.
*   **Leverage Flywheels** The integration of leverage is a core innovation that powers the entire system, enabling superior odds and payouts for bettors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:22">[02:28:22]</a>.
    *   Bets are tokenized (e.g., an even-money bet tokenized as a 50-cent token that cashes for $1 if won) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:37">[02:33:37]</a>.
    *   Leverage is achieved by having a small collateral amount (e.g., 10 cents) back a larger exposure (e.g., 50 cents for 5x leverage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:46">[02:33:46]</a>.
    *   Live game odds are continuously monitored, and if the token's theoretical value drops below a certain point, the position is liquidated automatically. This liquidation check occurs before users can sell or cash their positions, ensuring no bad debt is accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:51">[02:33:51]</a>.
    *   Odds are aggregated from top casinos, similar to how GMX aggregates prices from multiple exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:01">[02:35:01]</a>.
*   **Superior Odds** By generating revenue from borrow rates rather than traditional "vig" (vigorish or juice) on betting lines, the platform can remove the vig and offer more favorable odds to users compared to existing sportsbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:07">[02:36:07]</a>.

## Market Opportunity and Go-to-Market Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:38">[02:28:38]</a>

The market for Web3 sports betting presents a significant opportunity:
*   Over 100,000 unique wallet addresses engaged with Gamble-Fi on EVM chains in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:41">[02:28:41]</a>.
*   The global sports betting market is estimated at over $300 billion, with regulated betting generating $100 billion in annual revenue and illicit markets accounting for over twice that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:25">[02:29:25]</a>.

The go-to-market strategy for Web3 sports betting platforms involves several phases:

1.  **Initial Web3 Focus** Beginning with Web3 sports bettors on high-performance chains like Monad to leverage technological advantages for a smooth product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:51">[02:29:51]</a>.
2.  **Community Building** Prioritizing community engagement during initial beta tests on testnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>.
3.  **Mainnet Launch & Cash Bets** Moving to mainnet to enable full cash bets once the product functionality is proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:30">[02:31:30]</a>.
4.  **Web2 Audience Expansion** Abstracting blockchain complexities and implementing a clean UI/UX with familiar payment rails to attract a broader Web2 retail audience. This process is part of [[building_user_experiences_in_crypto_and_web3_integration | abstracting away the blockchain components]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>.
5.  **Traditional Partnerships** Pursuing partnerships with traditional sportsbooks and casinos to further expand reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:29">[02:30:29]</a>.
6.  **Vampire Attack Strategy** Directly competing with existing products by highlighting the platform's superior profitability and odds, particularly against popular parlays which are significant profit drivers for casinos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:44">[02:35:44]</a>. This strategy aims to educate users on how the new model offers greater profitability compared to traditional betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:44">[02:35:44]</a>.

The goal is to capture market share through a sharp technical advantage that offers superior odds, payouts, and functionality, making users "sticky" to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:09">[02:29:09]</a>.

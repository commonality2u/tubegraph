While widely used for their convenience, text message codes (SMS) for authentication pose significant [[Understanding MultiFactor Authentication and Its Risks | risks]] to user [[Importance of User Security in Crypto | security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## What are Text Codes for Authentication?

Text codes are a form of [[Introduction to Multifactor Authentication | MultiFactor Authentication (MFA)]] where, after entering a password, a user receives a unique code via text message to verify their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This method is often encountered when logging into accounts like online banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Why Text Codes are Dangerous

Despite their perceived simplicity and ease of use, text codes are considered a very dangerous [[Common Methods of Multifactor Authentication | MFA]] method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The primary concern is that the "vectors for compromise" increase exponentially if an attacker gains consistent access to these codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Vulnerabilities

The main vulnerabilities associated with text message codes include:

*   **SIM Swapping** An attacker can gain control of a user's phone number through a "SIM swap" attack, redirecting incoming texts (including authentication codes) to a device controlled by the attacker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Direct Phone Access** If an attacker gains direct access to a user's phone, they can intercept incoming text codes, making it easy to bypass the second authentication factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Consequences

The exponential increase in compromise vectors means that an individual's entire digital life and financial assets can be jeopardized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Neglecting to take the extra steps to avoid using text message codes for authentication can lead to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Instead of text codes, more secure [[Common Methods of Multifactor Authentication | MFA methods]] include:
*   [[Biometric Methods for Authentication | Biometric authentication]] (e.g., Face ID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Hardware keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Authenticator apps, ideally installed on a secondary device for enhanced [[Security Considerations for Authentication Codes | security considerations for authentication codes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

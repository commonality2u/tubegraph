The "Pipeline" is a web3 podcast focused on Monad, aiming to bring on knowledgeable guests to discuss all things [[web3 and blockchain technology | web3]], with a particular emphasis on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Addressing Misinformation in Crypto

A significant challenge in [[cryptocurrency and blockchain technology | crypto]] today is the widespread misinformation and disinformation, impacting awareness and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Much of this misinformation often originates from individuals who may not possess a strong technical background or deep domain knowledge in the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. For example, those with political science degrees may not understand complex [[challenges and propositions in blockchain technology | blockchain engineering]] as thoroughly as engineers working on these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Often, early success in [[cryptocurrency and blockchain technology | crypto]] can lead to a "blind leading the blind" scenario, where individuals with wealth gained from early investments are looked up to, despite lacking technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Proposed Solutions
To combat this, it is crucial for more "builders" – the engineers and developers – to speak out and produce content such as podcasts and writings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This approach aims to foster a meritocracy of ideas where the best concepts can rise to the top through discourse and checks and balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. It is important to correct misinformation without being directly insulting, protecting the work of those building on various networks from narratives based on lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Growing a Blockchain Ecosystem

For a [[cryptocurrency and blockchain technology | blockchain]] ecosystem to reach critical mass, several elements are essential:
*   **Community:** A strong community is paramount, as blockchains are essentially community computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Developers:** A robust developer community is a must, as these are the individuals building on the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Hackathons, like those Solana conducts, are vital for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Shared Values:** Combined values within the community, such as a focus on low user costs, product innovation, and tinkering, contribute to different outcomes for networks like Solana and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Ecosystems that endure catastrophic events and emerge stronger, as seen with Solana and Ethereum, signal a meaningful foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## The Future of Blockchain Scaling

### Bottom-Up System Optimization
When building systems like blockchains, a "bottoms-up" approach is fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This means optimizing the foundational layer first, like designing the best engine for a race car, before focusing on other components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Solana and Monad exemplify this by optimizing the base layer (the "engine") as much as possible, ensuring software efficiently utilizes hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This approach makes other parts easier to build and results in less fragmented or "duct-taped" scaling solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Monad's Value Proposition
Monad addresses many Ethereum performance bottlenecks through features like parallel execution and deferred execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Unlike Ethereum's single-thread execution model, Monad can process non-overlapping transactions (A, B, C) simultaneously, greatly improving throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Deferred Execution:** Monad separates transaction ordering from execution, allowing execution to occur without waiting for consensus, an "obvious insight" that significantly helps performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Other Improvements:** Monad also addresses state growth and access inefficiencies, as well as inefficient code in the EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

These improvements aim to allow builders to focus on product development rather than worrying about underlying scalability issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

### Coexistence of EVM and SVM
The coexistence of different [[technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | blockchain tech]] stacks like the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. History shows that no single tech stack dominates completely (e.g., iOS vs. Android, Xbox vs. PlayStation, AWS vs. Google Cloud) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Solana and Monad are not merely Ethereum forks; they optimize for different things in meaningful ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Solana, for instance, enables features like on-chain order books, which are difficult or impossible on other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

The debate around validator costs and throughput highlights different design philosophies:
*   **Ethereum's Approach:** Optimizes for nodes being as accessible as possible to run globally, even for individuals with minimal resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. The demand for running a node should stem from valuable network activity or business needs, not just for the sake of running one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Solana's Approach:** Has higher node requirements, particularly for internet connection, but offers greater benefits from running a validator, allowing for the creation of unique applications not possible elsewhere (e.g., minting millions of NFTs for a low cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

Both networks ultimately aim for an endgame where block production occurs on higher-hardware machines, and user verification is done on lighter machines via light clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. This suggests that the current "trade-off" is a short-term path rather than a fundamental difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

## L1 vs. L2 Scaling Debates

While Layer 2s (L2s) are viable for use cases that don't require global state or have strict finality requirements (e.g., small games) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>, proclaiming them as the "only way forward" or the "savior of [[cryptocurrency and blockchain technology | crypto]]" is inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. Layer 1s (L1s) generally offer more flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. The idea of thousands of L2s for every website is unlikely due to fragmentation and Ethereum's inability to handle such scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

Monad's decision to launch as an L1 is a "no-brainer" from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. If the goal is to build decentralized applications that solve real problems, starting with a scalable and decentralized L1 is optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. While L2s are gaining ground, they are still often permissioned and centralized, and fully sharded Ethereum is years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Monad, as an L1 EVM, can offer similar benefits to Solana in terms of scalability while retaining EVM compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

## Attracting Developers and [[the evolution and future of web 3 gaming | Web3]]'s Future

Attracting developers to [[cryptocurrency and blockchain technology | blockchain]] platforms involves several factors:
*   **EVM vs. SVM/Move:** Current [[cryptocurrency and blockchain technology | crypto]] developers are dispersed across SVM, Move, and predominantly EVM chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. Solidity on EVM is generally simpler to write compared to Solana programming (Rust + functional programming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   **Web2 Developers:** [[The future of Web3 gaming | Web2]] developers, who focus on building scalable products and businesses, will choose the best tool for the job. For globally shared, composable state machines, they might opt for Monad or Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   **Copy-Pasting DApps:** The ability to easily copy and paste existing dApps from Ethereum to Monad could provide a significant momentum boost, showing users a much better experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

In the next one to two years, with blockchains finally scaling and offering delightful user experiences, there will be increased competition and building activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. The emergence of viral, innovative applications like Farcaster could trigger a flywheel effect, attracting more users and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.

### Key Areas for [[future developments in crypto and blockchain technology | Blockchain's Next Step]]
*   **Solving Real Problems:** A crucial focus should be on building applications that solve real problems for users, rather than overly complex or abstract concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.
*   **Regulation:** Regulatory clarity is a significant factor impacting the global [[cryptocurrency and blockchain technology | crypto]] movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **DeFi Improvements:** Decentralized Finance (DeFi) needs to enhance security and overcome latency differences compared to traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.

*   **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs):** These networks, like Helium or Hivemapper, leverage tokens to bootstrap physical infrastructure, enabling new companies and competition in sectors like mobile and mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.
*   **Payments:** Payments remain an "OG" and vital use case, offering much easier international money transfers compared to traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.
*   **Digital Identity:** Another promising area for future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.
*   **On-chain Order Books:** Monad aims to enable fully on-chain order books on the EVM, which could lead to better capital efficiency in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.

Ultimately, the biggest challenge in tech is not just building the technology but getting people to care and build on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Success depends on attracting valuable builders, fostering a community with distinct shared values, and growing and retaining users over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.

## Helus Labs: Optimizing Developer Experience

Helus Labs, founded by Mt, aims to solve the problem of a lack of useful applications in [[cryptocurrency and blockchain technology | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. Historically, building fast, cheap, and scalable applications has been difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. Helus provides developers with the tools they need to focus on product rather than worrying about the underlying complexities of building on high-performance L1s like Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. While currently focused on Solana, there is potential for collaboration and shared lessons with projects like Monad on high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

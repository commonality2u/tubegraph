The path to effective leadership for [[role_of_founders_in_startups|founders]] is often counterintuitive: it begins with being a "great soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The most successful [[role_of_founders_in_startups|founders]] who eventually became leaders did so because they were initially "great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Responsibilities of an Early Stage Founder

## Advice for Early Stage Founders

> [!tip] Be a Great Soldier
> The advice for [[role_of_founders_in_startups|early stage founders]] is to be a "great Soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This means engaging directly in many battles on the ground before considering [[hiring_and_cofounder_selection|hiring]] additional team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This hands-on experience provides crucial insight into how to effectively [[hiring_and_cofounder_selection|hire]] "great soldiers" later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Transition to Leadership

There is a natural transition period where a founder evolves from a "soldier" into a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While ample support exists for developing into a leadership role, there is notably less support for individuals aiming to become "great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Importance of Ground-Level Experience
A "great warrior" or "soldier" is naturally positioned to become a "great leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Conversely, a leader who has never experienced fighting battles on the ground may not be very effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The focus should be on cultivating the "greatest of soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

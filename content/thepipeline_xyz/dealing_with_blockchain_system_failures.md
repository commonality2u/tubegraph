Blockchain systems, despite their decentralized nature, are susceptible to failures, especially under periods of extreme load or unanticipated events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A primary goal for blockchain developers is to ensure graceful handling of high-stress scenarios without needing to make excuses for performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Causes and Symptoms of Failure

High-stress events often involve a large number of concurrent users attempting many transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A common example is an NFT mint, where a massive influx of users "slams" the system simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

When systems fail under stress, common symptoms and excuses include:
*   Remote Procedure Call (RPC) failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Transactions getting reverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
These issues often surface on social media platforms like Twitter when things go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Case Study: Solana in Fall 2021

The user experience on Solana in the fall of 2021 provides a significant example of system failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This period was characterized by unanticipated events, such as people from across the globe "absolutely spam clicking mint buttons," leading to widespread system issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Strategies for Prevention and Mitigation

### Continuous Monitoring and Optimization

Even if a system like Manad is hoped to handle stress gracefully, constant monitoring of data and ongoing optimization are crucial for improving performance and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Advanced Stress Testing

To proactively identify weaknesses and prevent failures, subjecting blockchain systems to extreme stress is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

A promising approach involves using [[exploring_ai_in_blockchain_stress_testing | AI agents]] on testnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The combination of [[exploring_ai_in_blockchain_stress_testing | AI]] and [[discussion_on_high_throughput_blockchains | high throughput]] testing could yield interesting results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Incentivizing [[exploring_ai_in_blockchain_stress_testing | AI]] to intentionally try and crash the test system can reveal vulnerabilities that human interaction might miss, as robots can click far more intensely than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Pike Finance is a cross-chain lending market striving to unify liquidity across the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The project benefits from its team's extensive background in crypto and finance, particularly from the development studio, Nuts Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Team Background
Sushan, a co-founder at Pike Finance, has an entrepreneurial background, having been a startup founder for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. He developed a keen interest in [[innovations_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] during the 2017 bull run and returned for "DeFi summer," becoming a fan of the Polkadot ecosystem's focus on interoperability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Sushan joined a Polkadot parachain where he met Terry, eventually moving to Nuts Finance due to his respect for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Terry, also from Pike Finance, entered crypto in late 2017/early 2018 through his previous startup, a margin FX trading platform, which saw user demand for crypto pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. After selling his first startup's business, he fully committed to crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Terry has a finance background, starting his career in bond ratings across different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. He co-founded Nuts Finance with Daniel in early 2018, envisioning how blockchain could enhance financial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Nuts Finance, the development studio behind Pike, has built and launched multiple [[adoption_and_potential_of_defi_and_decentralized_exchanges_dexes | DeFi]] protocols across various ecosystems (EVM and non-EVM) since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Their thesis has been that no single chain would dominate, leading them to build in the Polkadot ecosystem to support inter-chain communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## How Pike Finance Operates
Pike Finance's core function is a cross-chain lending market, enabling users to deposit assets on one chain and borrow against them on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The protocol aims to unify liquidity across diverse DeFi ecosystems, including EVM chains like Ethereum, Optimism, and soon [[defi_developments_on_monad | Monad]], as well as non-EVM ecosystems like Solana, IBC, Cosmos, and Move power chains such as Aptos and Sui <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This vision is encapsulated in its tagline: "universal liquidity protocol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

A key distinguishing feature is that Pike Finance does *not* use bridges for cross-chain functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Instead, it utilizes cross-chain messaging, specifically leveraging Wormhole messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This means assets are not sent directly between chains (e.g., Optimism to Base) to facilitate borrows. Instead, a message is sent confirming a user's deposit on one chain, allowing them to borrow on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This approach bypasses security concerns often associated with bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

Pike Finance exclusively deals with native assets, avoiding bridged assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This decision aims to simplify the user experience by eliminating the complex prefixes and suffixes (e.g., "LP token," "derivative token") that often accompany wrapped or derivative assets in DeFi, making the ecosystem more accessible to new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Early Commitment to Monad
Pike Finance demonstrated early commitment to [[defi_developments_on_monad | Monad]] before its testnet or mainnet launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This decision was largely driven by Monad's focus on performance and low transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

Sushan highlights Solana as an example of a chain that cracked the code for performance, offering a web2-like user experience due to its speed and low cost, despite being a monolithic layer one with a high barrier to entry (requiring new wallets and asset bridging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Solana's high volume (second in crypto) and leading stablecoin transfers indicate that users prioritize performance and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Monad, according to Pike Finance, combines the best of both worlds:
*   **EVM Compatibility:** It maintains the EVM experience, making it frictionless for users with MetaMask and easy for developers to build dApps similar to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   **Performance and Low Fees:** It offers the speed and low costs characteristic of Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

This combination makes Monad a potential "huge winner" in the future, prompting Pike Finance to support and elevate it within the DeFi ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## Mainnet Launch and Early Traction
Pike Finance launched its mainnet on February 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This was a capped launch, intentionally limiting supply to stress test the system and ensure performance and reliability, as building on Arbitrary Message Bridges (AMBs) is still a new and complex endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

In the first five days of the capped launch, Pike Finance saw close to 4,000 unique wallet counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Users are interested in trying out native cross-chain applications, as evidenced by feedback in their Discord channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

Pike is deployed using a "hub and spoke" model, with the Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base serving as spoke chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Initial metrics show the most cross-chain messages registered on Arbitrum, followed by Optimism and Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. This aligns with the amount of [[adoption_and_potential_of_defi_and_decentralized_exchanges_dexes | DeFi]] activity on Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This early data supports Pike's thesis of a universal liquidity protocol, observing liquidity flow between Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, indicating a "Melting Pot" concept for user interaction and liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

## Future Roadmap and Goals
The [[future_roadmap_and_goals_for_pike_finance | future roadmap and goals for Pike Finance]] include:
*   **Uncapping Supply:** The immediate next milestone is to uncapped the supply, which is expected around March, following diligent internal and external security assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.
*   **New Asset Support (Mid-term):** Pike is exploring supporting new types of assets like LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) and LRTs (Liquid Restaking Tokens). They anticipate LSTs and LRTs expanding beyond Ethereum to other ecosystems with staking assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>. The high performance of an EVM like Monad could serve as a hub to connect liquidity with other chains for these new asset types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>. This is currently in the research and ideation phase and depends on Monad's development schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.
*   **Cross-Chain Governance (Long-term):** As AMBs become more robust and more applications build on them, there will be a need for efficient governance across multiple chains where an application is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. Pike Finance aims to minimize the overhead for builders while maximizing participation in governance across all chains where Pike is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. The goal is to extend the "Melting Pot" concept from liquidity to community and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

## Community Building and Vision
Pike Finance emphasizes a long-term, quality-focused approach to community building, learning significantly from Monad's model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. They prioritize meaningful conversations over vanity metrics like high TVL or token price, understanding that sustainable growth comes from a genuinely engaged user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.

The project encourages its community to "earn their way in" by providing value, fostering a sense of belonging and ensuring discussions aren't diluted by bots or short-term participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. This strategy results in a loyal fanbase that constantly generates organic content (memes, art, songs, etc.), keeping Pike Finance top-of-mind for users without aggressive official marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

A notable example of this community engagement is the Pikeans NFT collection, which was entirely community-driven from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. This initiative, spearheaded by a community member named Mojo, became a symbol of identity and belonging for Pike community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. The team supports and amplifies these community-led efforts, viewing themselves as part of the community, fostering a unified entity striving for the same goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. This approach creates authentic relationships and a vibrant culture, essential for long-term success in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

## Final Alpha Insights
Terry offers two pieces of advice:
1.  **Identify Teams That Have Lasted Through Cycles:** When looking for projects to invest in or partners to work with, prioritize teams that have continuously built and improved over multiple market cycles, regardless of past success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Their persistence often indicates resilience and a commitment to their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.
2.  **Talk to More Young People:** Gaining insights from young people is crucial, as they can receive and process information quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. Their perspective, even if unrelated to crypto, can provide valuable inspiration for work and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

Sushan adds a crypto-specific insight:
*   **Don't Fade Base:** Despite some perceptions, Base is likely to become a crucial vehicle for millions of people familiar with traditional finance (e.g., Coinbase users) to onboard into the on-chain ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>. Coinbase's focus on improving user experience and its brand's message (addressing issues like inflation for young people) positions Base to drive mainstream adoption, particularly in regions like North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

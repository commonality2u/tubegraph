A notable incident of [[fraudulent_transaction_tactics | fraud]] and [[social_engineering_and_phishing_attacks | social engineering]] targeted a prominent trader known as y22, resulting in the loss of his digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Incident

Y22, a trader recognized for sharing his trading journal and gaining significant traction in the [[crypto_twitter | crypto Twitter]] community due to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, became the target of a sophisticated attack.

## Attack Vector

The compromise began when an impostor posted a link to a Telegram group under y22's Twitter thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Upon joining the Telegram group, users were prompted to undergo a [[verification_and_compromise_on_digital_platforms | verification]] process that involved additional steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This process then directed the user to perform an action on their desktop browser, shifting them from a mobile device to a desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Performing this specific action on the desktop browser, where the victim's hot wallets were accessible, led to the compromise of y22's assets, causing him to lose almost everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Impersonation Tactics

The individual responsible for the attack employed extensive [[social_engineering_tactics | social engineering tactics]] to appear legitimate:
*   They mimicked y22's entire Twitter history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   The impostor replicated the follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   Their username was made similar to y22's actual Twitter handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   They even possessed a gold check mark, adding to their perceived authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

> [!WARNING] Attackers are willing to invest significant resources to achieve a compromise.
> Individuals should not assume that attackers are unwilling to spend substantial amounts of money, such as five figures, to compromise a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. [[access_vulnerabilities | Social engineering campaigns]] can involve considerable time, effort, and money, making them capable of compromising a large number of people at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

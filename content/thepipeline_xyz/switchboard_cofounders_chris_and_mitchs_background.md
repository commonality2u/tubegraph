Chris and Mitch are the co-founders of [[switchboards_oracle_solutions_and_market | Switchboard]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. They teamed up in May 2021 to build the oracle solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## Chris's Background

Chris has been involved in crypto for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. He was an early employee at Circle, starting in 2013-2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. At Circle, he held various roles, notably being the second person on their trading desk, working alongside CMS Holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. He observed the trading desk evolve from a small operation into a massive 24/7 global desk, which shaped his perspective on crypto and the possibilities achievable through hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

Chris departed Circle in 2019 when their team was acquired by Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. He then ventured out independently, focusing on investing and building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. He became involved with the Solana ecosystem early on, recognizing the demand for high-performance Layer 1 blockchains and cost-effective chains to facilitate new use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. From his trading background, he was optimistic that everything would eventually be tradable on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, an idea that was considered controversial even in 2018-2019, prior to the DeFi summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Initially, they aimed to develop a product for long-tail derivatives but soon realized the necessity of an oracle to support such ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Mitch's Background

Mitch was introduced to Chris through a mutual college friend in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Before joining Chris to build [[switchboards_oracle_solutions_and_market | Switchboard]], Mitch was leading a team focused on VPC networking within Google Cloud for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Prior to that role, he worked in security for Google Hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Mitch realized that the corporate environment was not for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a> and desired to create something of his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

Chris informed Mitch about the significant need for oracles on various blockchains and suggested prototyping a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Mitch developed a demo in approximately two weeks, and Chris managed to close their seed round within another two weeks, prompting Mitch to leave Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Mitch is grateful for the growth of [[switchboards_oracle_solutions_and_market | Switchboard]], which now covers a total volume of $2 billion and processes over 2 million transactions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. On Solana, [[switchboards_oracle_solutions_and_market | Switchboard]] accounts for 3% to 7% of traffic, depending on the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

The popular crypto application, Phantom, is set to support Monad from day one of its public testnet launch, including a custom-built experience specifically for the Monad user community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This collaboration marks a significant step in enhancing the user experience on the Monad network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Early Access and Experience with Monad

The Phantom team, including CEO Brandon and Developer Relations lead Brian, had early access to the private Monad testnet for several weeks prior to its public launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Their experience confirmed that "the chain is fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, which was an "awesome" experience, especially as it was the first time Phantom had worked with a chain being recreated from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This early access allowed them to build Monad support directly into the existing Phantom user experience, promising a "fast, super clean experience" without the need for network switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The collaboration was further enhanced by Monad's design as a composable L1 blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Why Day One Support Matters

Keon Han of the Monad Foundation highlighted the significance of Phantom's [[phantoms_support_for_monad_from_day_one | day one support]] for the [[monad_public_testnet_introduction | Monad testnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Phantom is recognized as a leading product for [[connecting_a_wallet_to_the_monad_testnet | onboarding new users]] into the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Keon recalled Phantom's launch in 2021 as a "game changer for Solana," setting a high standard for smooth and thoughtful user experience (UX), including features like managing multiple wallets cleanly and hiding spam tokens or NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This thoughtful approach to UX, especially in an environment with cheaper gas fees, is crucial for user safety and adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Brandon drew parallels between Monad's early testnet experience and "early Solana," describing it as "snappy and quick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, akin to how Ethereum mainnet was "supposed to feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Phantom aims to apply its learnings from developing in a fast and cheap Solana ecosystem to Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### The Importance of User Experience
The discussion emphasized that the user experience (UX) is critical for a chain's adoption, even though the chain itself doesn't have a UX; decentralized applications (dApps) create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Keon believes that a smooth "overall user flow," from onboarding assets and creating wallets to protections offered by wallets, is paramount for onboarding the next "multiples of the current user base in crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Without seamless UX, new users struggle with complex concepts like seed phrases and private keys, leading to poor retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Phantom's approach to user retention is key, including protecting users and preventing unintended actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Phantom now offers social login (Google, Apple ID) as a default onboarding method, significantly increasing new user influx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This aims to cater to users who don't care about seed phrases but want quick access to the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Phantom's Adaptability and Future Vision

Phantom's success on Solana, particularly during the rise of meme coins, demonstrates its ability to adapt quickly and release features that meet market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This "dynamic nature of crypto" is seen as an "Alpha seeking game" with evolving metas, requiring wallets to be agile and built on primitives that can transfer across trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Phantom focuses on user security and safety while having the "superpower" to play into any emerging trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

The Phantom team sees similar "DNA" in Monad—a focus on practicality, pragmatism, and engineering, which are vital for surviving the early stages of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. Brian expressed excitement that Monad could "carry the torch on like the future of EVM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, emphasizing the potential for a "Monad-native ecosystem team that wants to work together in this composable way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

### User Personas and Feature Development
Phantom primarily builds for "net new users" and "mainstream users," aiming to make crypto palatable for those who might otherwise choose traditional apps like Robinhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. They translate features popular with power users into mainstream-friendly formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. An example is the trending token page, which is based on aggregate user activity, providing an "Alpha" source for new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

The future of crypto UX, according to Phantom, is increasingly "mobile-oriented and mobile-first," driven by fast and cheap infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. They anticipate a multi-chain world with fewer dominant ecosystems and fewer chain-specific wallet apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Phantom aims to abstract away complexities while retaining crypto's core principles, enabling easy cash in/out and social features like finding friends via usernames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

A key challenge for wallets is the "discovery" problem—helping users find relevant applications and tokens in a fragmented information landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>. Phantom is working on infrastructure to address this, aiming to integrate discovery features into the wallet itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

The partnership between Phantom and Monad is viewed with significant optimism. Phantom's proven track record in creating intuitive, user-friendly experiences and its commitment to rapid iteration align well with Monad's engineering-focused and composable design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. This [[integration_of_daps_community_with_monad | integration]] is expected to provide a smooth onboarding and retention pathway for a wide range of users into the Monad ecosystem.

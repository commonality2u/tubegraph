From: [[thepipeline_xyz]] <br/> 

Monad's future outlook involves significant milestones, continued [[monads_team_and_community_development | team and community development]], and an increased physical presence at industry events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. The overarching goal is to press forward and launch a strong mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Next Milestones

Devnet, a fully functioning blockchain environment for Monad, is currently an internal core team environment used to dogfood the blockchain and identify areas for optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This process allows the team to refine the system through iterations of code development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

The next major milestone on the horizon is the testnet, which will be launched in phases, allowing for broader access and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Team and [[Community involvement and opportunities in the Monad ecosystem | Community Development]]

Monad is committed to expanding its team across all areas, especially engineering, to support its growing ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. The Monad blockchain is considered the "skeleton," while the ecosystem of applications, tooling, and infrastructure are the "muscles and tendons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. The [[Community involvement and opportunities in the Monad ecosystem | community]] is described as the "beating heart" that makes the entire system a "living, breathing body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. The efforts of the core team in building the blockchain are made worthwhile by the broader developer and crypto [[Community involvement and opportunities in the Monad ecosystem | community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

## Physical Presence and Events

Looking ahead, Monad plans to establish a stronger physical presence at various conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. There are also plans to potentially host their own events in New York, including discussions around organizing a hackathon further down the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. This increased presence aims to foster greater involvement within the broader ecosystem and highlight Monad's offerings to developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. The recognition of Monad has grown significantly, with people now stopping team members on the street after seeing Monad merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Monad Swag

For those interested in obtaining Monad merchandise, new designs and "drip" are expected in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Team members often carry a small handful of swag at conferences for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. For those unable to attend events, information on how to acquire new merch will be provided through updates and the pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

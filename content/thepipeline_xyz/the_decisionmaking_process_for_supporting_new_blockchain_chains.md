Phantom, a prominent non-custodial wallet, has publicly committed to supporting Monad from day one of its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This decision highlights key considerations for Phantom in choosing which new [[growth_and_scalability_challenges_in_blockchain_ecosystems | blockchain ecosystems]] to integrate.

## Phantom's Multi-Chain Strategy and Core Principles
Phantom's journey has been deliberately structured to evolve into a multi-chain wallet from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. The team believes the future of [[growth_and_scalability_challenges_in_blockchain_ecosystems | blockchain ecosystems]] will be multi-chain, with perhaps two to five dominant ecosystems forming robust communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Phantom's role is to identify the chains poised to emerge as winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The most critical underlying principle for Phantom's decisions is **technology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The company aims to onboard the next billion users, which necessitates scalable technology solutions readily available today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Key aspects influencing Phantom's support decisions include:
*   **Technological Innovation** The approach Monad is taking with its technology, including innovations in consensus and parallel execution, is a significant draw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This reminds Phantom of how Solana initially approached the market with pragmatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **EVM Compatibility** Monad's EVM compatibility is seen as a crucial advantage, as it has the best chance of marrying a user base that demands fast and cheap transactions with the existing, robust EVM ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Pragmatism over Dogmatism** Phantom experienced burnout in the Ethereum ecosystem from 2017-2021 due to the slow pace of development, which was attributed to a dogmatic approach to decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. Monad's philosophical alignment with pragmatism, similar to Solana, is highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.
*   **User Expectations** Phantom's user base is accustomed to fast and cheap transaction experiences, primarily from Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Monad's capabilities align with this expectation, offering a way to bring those benefits to the EVM world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.
*   **Community Building** Phantom observed Solana's "non-consensus" bet leading to a unique and strong community forged through shared experiences, especially during challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Monad is seen as making similar early steps to develop its own unique community by taking non-consensus bets in the EVM Layer 1 space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Strategic Market Entry** Phantom initially chose Solana to "plant its own flag" in a new ecosystem where there were fewer established competitors and less noise, allowing them to become a cornerstone of the user experience before expanding further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

## Monad's Rationale for a Layer 1 Blockchain
Monad's decision to launch as a Layer 1 (L1) rather than a Layer 2 (L2) is driven by several major reasons:
*   **Decentralization, Performance, and Cost** Monad aims to deliver the best of both worlds, achieving [[high_performance_blockchains | high performance]] while maintaining strong decentralization and low costs for end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Maximizing Machine Performance** Given the significant resources invested in running hundreds or thousands of machines globally for a blockchain network, Monad believes in extracting the maximum performance possible from these machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. This requires fundamental software changes, new architecture, and low-level optimizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.
*   **Overcoming the Trilemma** While acknowledging that performance can impact decentralization at certain scales, Monad's goal is to constantly move "up and to the right" on a performance-decentralization graph through novel architecture and software improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Control** Monad emphasizes the importance of decentralized control of block production, avoiding reliance on a single sequencer, and enforcing censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. They observed significant compromises in decentralization with current L2 solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.

## Enhancing Multi-Chain Connectivity
Phantom plays a crucial role in [[Challenges and solutions in blockchain bridging | multi-chain connectivity]]:
*   **Integrated Bridging** Phantom plans to embed bridges directly into the wallet's swap functionality, enabling seamless movement of funds between chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. Bridges are seen as a fundamental cornerstone for moving liquidity, the "lifeblood of financial activity," across different [[growth_and_scalability_challenges_in_blockchain_ecosystems | blockchain ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. Wallet-integrated bridges simplify tedious transaction confirmations, offering a much smoother user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   **Improved Onboarding** Phantom's acquisition of Bitsky, a creator of embedded wallets, aims to make Phantom's own [[advanced_mechanisms_in_blockchain_onboarding | onboarding]] experience as easy as web2 sign-ups using familiar identifiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This technology can also facilitate better [[advanced_mechanisms_in_blockchain_onboarding | onboarding]] of new users or existing users from other blockchains into new ecosystems like Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. The goal is to allow users to seamlessly sign up for a DApp on Monad without leaving the DApp or downloading another application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

## Vision for the Future
Both Phantom and Monad share a vision for "growing the pie" in [[Crypto and blockchain influences | crypto]], bringing [[Crypto and blockchain influences | blockchain technology]] to new users, products, and use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

*   **Super App Concept** Monad envisions a future similar to WeChat, where a wallet becomes an immersive environment for various applications, all coexisting on a shared, globally replicated blockchain substrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This allows for composability and interaction between applications, building complex functionality by reusing other apps as subroutines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Payments as a Key Use Case** Phantom remains bullish on payments, especially with developments like Stripe enabling any merchant to accept [[Crypto and blockchain influences | crypto]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This could change market structure, making [[Crypto and blockchain influences | crypto]] a cheaper alternative to credit cards for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Creator Economy Innovation** Projects like Drip House, which changed the NFT meta from scarce collectibles to abundant items focused on creator relationships and micro-payments, exemplify the type of innovation that scalable systems like Monad can enable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

The collaboration between Phantom and Monad is viewed as a critical step in making [[high_performance_blockchains | high performance]] and decentralized [[Crypto and blockchain influences | crypto]] accessible to the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

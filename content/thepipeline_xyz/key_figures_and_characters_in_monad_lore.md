The [[History of the Monad Community | Monad community]] has developed a rich and intricate lore over two years, featuring a variety of figures and memorable characters, from the early days of its loyalists, the "Nads," to numerous community-created mascots and inside jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

*   **Port** Port runs the Discord "Poker Knights" event, which originated from "Peso's Poker" and has been running for over a year, maintaining its weekly relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.

Pulse is at the forefront of [[emerging_consumer_apps_leveraging_blockchain_technology | consumer crypto]], developing a product that combines both software and hardware in the [[health_and_lifestyle_wearables | wearable tech]] sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This initiative aims to address prevalent issues in traditional wearables, particularly concerning user data ownership and compensation.

## The Vision Behind Pulse

Nix, the founder of Pulse, shares a personal motivation for the project, stemming from his own experience of neglecting health while building startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. He realized that physical well-being directly impacts productivity and overall life satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Pulse is conceived not merely as a health wearable, but a [[health_and_lifestyle_wearables | lifestyle wearable]] designed to enhance various aspects of a user's life, helping them become better operators, builders, and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The core outcome Pulse strives for is increasing user productivity through improved health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Addressing Data Ownership and Transparency

A significant differentiator for Pulse lies in its approach to user data. Traditional wearables like Whoop, Fitbit, and Aura Ring often acquire and sell user data to third parties without rewarding the data generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Instances such as Aura and Whoop selling data to companies, or 23andMe selling DNA data for millions, highlight this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Pulse leverages crypto rails to establish a transparent [[data_security | data brokerage]] mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This allows users to be notified, review opportunities, and decide whether to license their data, ensuring they receive value back for the data they generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For example, a research entity like the University of Oxford could acquire data for a clinical study, paying participants directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Crypto rails provide transparency regarding what data is shared, for how long, and its intended use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Data Security and Privacy

Beyond transparency, Pulse emphasizes [[data_security | data security]] and privacy. The aim is to store as much data as possible encrypted on-chain, using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) powered encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. This ensures that only the user can decrypt their data, providing confidence against hacks or data leakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. The use of fully homomorphic encryption allows for data insights without exposing raw data to third parties, a method also explored by companies like Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. This approach aims to prevent large-scale data breaches, such as the 23andMe hack or the Change Healthcare incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>.

## Hardware Development Challenges

Developing hardware for Pulse has been an arduous process, described as "chewing glass that is on fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Unlike software, mistakes in hardware development can lead to complete restarts and significant delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The team dedicated an entire summer to production, including finding suppliers, testing capabilities, benchmarking, and figuring out logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. A co-founder even moved to China to oversee the manufacturing process until completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

Despite the difficulties, building custom hardware offers strategic advantages:
*   **Creating a Moat:** It prevents other companies from displacing Pulse by revoking API access, a risk when relying on third-party hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **NFC Chip Integration:** The wearable includes an NFC chip, allowing for direct crypto wallet integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This enables "proof of pulse" to verify that "one wallet equals one human" without doxing users, valuable for validating real human users in web3 applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure for Developers:** Pulse envisions its wearable as an infrastructure piece, providing an API and SDK for other teams to build software on top of its device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Product Design and Functionality

Pulse's design philosophy is informed by an extensive assessment of existing wearables like Whoop, Aura, UltraHuman Ring, Fitbit, and Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. While many people use Whoop primarily for sleep tracking, Pulse aims to optimize for overall productivity, considering factors beyond just strain and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This includes monitoring sleep, gym activity, diet, stress levels, sun exposure, socializing, and overall fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

The device uses multiple sensors to automatically detect a user's activities and lifestyle patterns:
*   **Accelerometer:** Detects movement, acceleration, and deceleration, helping to identify activities like weightlifting or running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
*   **Temperature Sensors:** Indicate whether a user is outdoors or indoors (e.g., in hot yoga), by comparing local temperature to body temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
*   **Heart Rate Sensors:** Monitor heart rate patterns, which can indicate consistent physical activity like running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

Pulse aims to auto-detect about 50 common activities, including swimming, running, boxing, lifting weights, yoga, and Pilates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Beyond specific exercises, it also tracks general lifestyle data, such as prolonged sitting, and can nudge users towards more energetic or productive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

Nix clarifies that Pulse is not about rewarding users for being healthier; the reward for that is personal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Instead, the value and rewards come from sharing daily life data with third parties who want to build products, develop drugs, or create new services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. Even without intense exercise, a user's data remains valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. Pulse also plans to explore incentivizing users to contribute more comprehensive data, such as blood work, DNA, and electronic health records, to build a more valuable "Health Digital Twin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.

## Growth Strategy and Community Building

Pulse's initial growth strategy focuses on building a hardcore fan base within the crypto community, aiming for 0 to 10,000 users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This phase will refine the app, positioning, and branding, proving the product's stickiness and value for productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

Subsequently, Pulse plans to expand into the broader "normie" market, engaging users on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Marketing will use relatable language, targeting demographics like busy moms, students, and high-performers, framing the product around increased energy, focus, and overall self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Scaling from 10K to 100K and eventually to a million users will involve varied messaging and platforms, including influencer marketing, paid advertising, and performance-based marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

Once a healthy level of distribution (around 100K daily active users) is achieved, Pulse will pursue data acquisition deals with companies interested in licensing aggregated user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

Building a community around Pulse benefits significantly from crypto's inherent advantages in fostering culture and incentivizing participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. Unlike traditional startups that pay users for feedback, crypto allows for bootstrapping a loyal user base through token ownership and data ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This creates a strong community that is already "pilled" on the value of [[emerging_consumer_apps_leveraging_blockchain_technology | consumer crypto]] and the benefits of Pulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. The Monad community, known for its focus on health and wellness (e.g., Iron Nads, Monad Run Club), aligns perfectly with Pulse's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.

## Choosing Monad

Pulse chose to build on Monad due to its infrastructure meeting their needs for speed and user experience, which are crucial for a consumer-facing application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. They prioritize low latency and throughput over DeFi metrics like TVL or liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. Additionally, the existing Monad community's excitement about [[emerging_consumer_apps_leveraging_blockchain_technology | consumer crypto]] and health made it an ideal fit for galvanizing a super-fan base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

## Tips for Health Optimization

From the perspective of health optimization, two underrated tips are:
*   **Blackout Curtains:** These significantly help regulate sleep cycles by blocking out early morning sun, improving sleep quality and overall daily well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Consistent Exercise:** Despite the focus on diet and micro-optimizations, regular physical exercise like running or lifting weights is often overlooked but provides massive benefits in productivity, mood, and overall sharpness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. Finding enjoyable forms of exercise, such as pickleball, Orange Theory, spin classes, or hot yoga, can make consistency easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

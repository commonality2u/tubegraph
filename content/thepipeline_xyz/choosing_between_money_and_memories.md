When presented with the [[hypothetical_scenarios_and_personal_choices | hypothetical scenario]] of losing either all money or all memories, the individual immediately opts to lose all money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The [[hypothetical_choices_and_their_reasoning | reasoning]] behind this decision is practical and centered on recovery:
*   Money can be earned back relatively easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Memories, representing lost years, cannot be regained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

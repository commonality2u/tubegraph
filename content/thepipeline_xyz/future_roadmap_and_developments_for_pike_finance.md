Pike Finance is focusing on a progressive roadmap, starting with key milestones and expanding into new use cases and cross-chain functionalities. The team's vision extends to unifying liquidity, community, and governance across various blockchain ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

## Short-Term Milestones

The immediate next milestone for Pike Finance is to achieve a "live cap" for its mainnet, which is anticipated sometime in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. This capped launch was deliberate to allow for continued stress testing of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Building on top of Arbitrary Message Bridges (AMBs) is still very new, requiring assurance of performance and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

## Mid-Term Horizon: New Use Cases and Asset Support

Pike Finance is actively exploring new use cases for cross-chain lending, particularly focusing on supporting new types of assets like Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. The team anticipates that LSTs and LRTs will expand beyond Ethereum to other ecosystems that support staking assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

The ability to test and "testify" these builds on a high-performing EVM like [[future_prospects_and_applications_on_the_monad_platform | Monad]] is crucial, as Monad could serve as a potential hub to connect liquidity with other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>. This exploration is currently in a "research and ideation phase" and its timeline is dependent on [[future_prospects_and_applications_on_the_monad_platform | Monad]]'s development schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.

## Long-Term Vision: Cross-Chain Governance

On a longer-term basis, Pike Finance's product roadmap includes the development of cross-chain governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. As Arbitrary Message Bridges (AMBs) become more robust, more applications are expected to build on them, which will necessitate the introduction of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.

Implementing governance across multiple chains can be a significant challenge for builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>. Pike Finance aims to leverage cross-chain governance to minimize overhead while maximizing participation across all the chains where Pike is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. The ultimate goal is to create a "Melting Pot" concept that not only applies to liquidity but also to community engagement and participation in governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

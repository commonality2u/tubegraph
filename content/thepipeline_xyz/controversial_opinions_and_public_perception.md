Sharing [[unconventional_beliefs_of_entrepreneurs | unconventional beliefs]] can lead to concerns about public perception and potential backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Nature of Unconventional Beliefs

One individual shared an [[unconventional_beliefs_of_entrepreneurs | unconventional belief]] that "traumatized children are funnier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This was clarified to mean minor, rather than "deep trauma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The rationale presented was that children who only experience positive things may not develop humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Concerns about Public Reception and "Cancelation"

Upon hearing this belief, another person immediately expressed concern about putting such a statement "on the internet," fearing it could lead to "cancelation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The potential misinterpretation that one might be advocating to "traumatize children" was raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The speaker elaborated on the underlying idea, suggesting that life cannot "just all be rainbows" and that some level of challenge is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This aligns with the broader idea that "suffering leads to growth" and "grit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

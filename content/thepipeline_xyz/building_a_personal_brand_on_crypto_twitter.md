Building a personal brand on [[crypto Twitter]] is a unique journey that prioritizes authenticity, engagement, and long-term relationships over short-term gains. It offers a path to success for individuals, even those without traditional credentials, by emphasizing genuine connection and an understanding of the crypto culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## The Journey of Pancakes_BR
Pancakes_BR initially started his [[crypto Twitter]] account with an "aggro" and less wholesome persona, intending to be the "worst trader possible" and playfully annoy big influencers <a class="yt-01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Over time, he "accidentally tripped into" a role of cultivating "good vibes" and "wholesome vibes" on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This shift to being his genuine self, dropping any "Pancakes" persona, made it easier to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

His approach evolved into being as genuine and honest as possible, which proved to be a "growth hack" for networking in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. He consciously avoided being confrontational, a common trait in the "cutthroat" crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

A significant turning point came when prominent figure Kobe randomly retweeted him early on, leading to consistent growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This exposure, combined with his unique, goofy, and sometimes "obnoxiously stupid" but always funny reply style, helped him gain followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. People eventually became endeared to his persistent, un-pissable-off attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

Despite initial financial struggles (buying the top and selling the bottom in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, losing money on PancakeSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>, and even driving Amazon Flex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>), a lucky NFT sale provided funds for a year-long conference circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This allowed him to meet anonymous accounts in person, building trust and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. He strategically avoided paid "shills" to protect his reputation for the long game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.

Eventually, he leveraged his built-up network by tweeting a serious request for a job, which led to a role at idex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. This opportunity, secured during a bear market, solidified his place in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.

## The Importance of [[building_and_engaging_community_in_crypto_spaces|Community and Trust]]
For Pancakes_BR, the [[the_importance_of_crypto_twitter_for_trading|community]] aspect of [[crypto Twitter]] is "wonderful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, fostering genuine friendships, unlike the competitive nature of the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a>. He believes it's one of the best opportunities for "outliers" without traditional backgrounds to prove themselves by simply "being yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>.

A key element is being a "good person" and building trust, as companies in crypto prioritize what you can deliver, your adaptability, and trustworthiness over credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>. He actively avoids arguments on the timeline, opting for silly replies to diffuse tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>.

[[Twitter spaces]] have been particularly impactful during the bear market, allowing for relationship building with both "deep CT native" and "web3/NFT crowd" individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.

Pancakes_BR views the [[crypto Twitter]] community as a "real community" where people care about each other, despite the presence of bad actors and "PVP" (player vs. player) dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of empathy, not getting "tilted," and taking personal responsibility for outcomes in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:13:13]</a>.

## Companies and Community Engagement
Protocols and companies that understand [[Influence and trends on crypto Twitter|the culture]] of crypto and engage authentically tend to succeed more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>. Companies should allow a human, relatable personality to run their Twitter, engaging in meme culture and even edgy humor as long as it's not hateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>. This contrasts with overly professional or "corporate" approaches that feel like "tourists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>.

Authenticity is key; users can easily detect when a company is trying too hard or being inauthentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>. Companies that are "part of the community" and whose leaders or marketing teams are genuinely engaged are seen as "one of the homies" and gain trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:09:00">[29:09:00]</a>. Hiring ambassadors or marketers from within the community who "get it" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>.

Understanding the "sentiment on the timeline" and "reading the room" is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>. This means showing empathy when the community is suffering (e.g., during FTX collapse) or using self-deprecating humor when appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>. When a team is genuinely part of the community, this "reading the room" becomes second nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>.

## Tips for Newcomers to Crypto
For those new to crypto, particularly seeking a job or deeper engagement, Pancakes_BR offers several tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:22:00">[34:22:00]</a>:

*   **Stick Around**: OG members of the space recognize and respect small accounts that remain engaged and positive during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25:00">[35:25:25]</a>.
*   **Be Genuine and Kind**: Be yourself, but avoid being an "asshole." Genuineness, kindness, empathy, and a light-hearted approach are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Control**: This is the biggest advantage in crypto, whether for trading, networking, or business development. It helps to look past short-term emotions and personal slights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50:00">[36:50:00]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Show up every day and tweet regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a>.
*   **Content Strategy**:
    *   Focus on your own tweets for your timeline, limiting retweets so people see your content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a>.
    *   Engage heavily through replies ("reply-guying"), even if it sounds "stupid." This built Pancakes_BR's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:27:00">[38:27:00]</a>.
*   **Willingness to Learn**: If you lack skills, teach yourself. This doesn't necessarily mean coding; it could be community management, Discord moderation, or running a Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>.
*   **Engage with Everyone**: Reply to every comment and DM, especially early on, for as long as it's scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>. This builds engagement and community loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>. Also, engage with larger accounts and influential people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:39:00">[41:39:00]</a>.
*   **Give Value for Free**: Be willing to contribute without immediately asking for anything in return. Long-term thinking often leads to greater opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Burn Bridges**: Be cautious about making enemies, as it's generally unnecessary unless dealing with clear scammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:11:00">[45:11:00]</a>.

## Future of Crypto and [[the_relationship_between_crypto_and_social_media|Social Media Marketing]]
For crypto to achieve mass adoption, it needs to appeal to the everyday person beyond just financial use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:57:00">[55:57:00]</a>. This could involve [[social media marketing in crypto|social media platforms]] or apps that are fun and engaging for their own sake, rather than solely because they are "crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:35:00">[55:35:00]</a>.

While gaming is often discussed, Pancakes_BR is somewhat bearish on crypto-native games, citing the difficulty of making genuinely fun games and the historical struggles of even large traditional studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:56:00">[57:56:00]</a>. He believes mass adoption in gaming might require established gaming companies to adopt blockchain technology themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:40:00">[58:40:00]</a>.

He is, however, highly bullish on crypto disrupting the music industry, not through NFTs (which he views as mostly hype and potentially harmful to crypto's reputation due to "grifting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>), but through protocols that ensure artists are paid quickly and efficiently, addressing the issue of 70% of music money never reaching the artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.

Ultimately, the crypto space needs to foster collaboration and avoid tribalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:04:00">[51:04:00]</a>. Everyone is on the same team, trying to figure things out, and positive developments for one protocol can benefit the entire ecosystem by improving crypto's overall reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:15:00">[52:15:00]</a>. It's about continuous improvement, admitting unknowns, and doing better over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

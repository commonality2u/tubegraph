## Valuing Personal Relationships

The speaker expresses deep gratitude for [[important_personal_relationships | their relationships]] with friends and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These connections are a significant source of appreciation.

## The Need for Collaboration

A key self-discovery for the speaker is their inability to work alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As a triplet, they have been surrounded by people since birth, which has shaped their preference for collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This preference extends to all aspects of their life, as they genuinely enjoy [[challenges_of_working_alone_versus_collaboration | doing things with other people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Furthermore, the speaker acknowledges that they do not possess all the necessary skills to accomplish everything on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This highlights the practical necessity of teamwork and shared expertise.

> "I can't work alone. So, I'm a triplet. There's three of me. And so, from the moment I was like introduced on Earth, I've always had like, you know, people around me. And I think that stands true for anything that I do. So, I just really enjoy being able to do things with other people. And I 100% don't have the skill to, you know, do everything myself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

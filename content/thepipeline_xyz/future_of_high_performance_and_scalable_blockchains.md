The blockchain industry is rapidly advancing, with a significant focus on addressing [[scalability_and_performance_of_crypto_networks | performance and scalability]] to enable mass adoption and support complex applications. Experts note that while the [[Technical challenges and solutions in blockchain performance | technical challenges]] are being met, the industry is poised for a new phase of growth focused on real-world use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

## Current Landscape and Challenges

Historically, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has been characterized as "slow, clunky, and broken," making it difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This has led to issues where, even with 50,000 users, gas fees on networks can "go through the roof" and become "literally unusable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. For example, when high volumes hit applications like GMX, Arbitrum's gas fees can increase to the point of being prohibitive for average users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

A major concern is that current infrastructure, including Solana, would "break immediately" if a single application reached the user base of a successful Web2 app like Instagram or Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Beyond performance, security remains a critical issue, with approximately $4 billion lost annually due to smart contract hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. The user experience is also noted as a bottleneck, with complexities around wallets and seed phrases deterring new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

Another challenge is the developer ecosystem. While Solana is doing well, getting builders to write in Rust is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, and there's a financial disincentive for developers not to use Solidity due to existing volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) on EVM chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Emerging Solutions and Innovations

New projects are emerging to address these challenges by focusing on [[high_throughput_blockchains_and_infrastructure_challenges | high throughput blockchains]] and enhanced infrastructure:

### Movement Labs (M2)
Movement Labs is building a network of Move-based blockchains, launching M2 as the first Move rollup on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. M2 leverages Ethereum's security and liquidity as a Layer 2 solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Key components include:
*   **Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM):** The execution environment, originally developed by Facebook's Diem project, offers strong security features like formal verification, which can prevent many common hack types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
*   **Celestia for Data Availability (DA):** Partnering with Celestia helps avoid high gas fees associated with traditional rollups on Ethereum, offering Layer 1-like performance with low fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Sequencer Set:** Utilizes Snow Consensus (from Avalanche) for a decentralized sequencer set with low hardware requirements and financial incentives for validators, ensuring network uptime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Fractal (Transpiler):** Allows any Solidity code to be mapped to Move opcodes, making Movement's MoveVM compatible with existing Solidity projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. This ensures "backwards compatibility" similar to running PS4 games on a PS5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. While not 100% the same security as native Move, it offers significantly enhanced security compared to traditional EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

### Monad
Monad aims to make the EVM fast by changing underlying components like the database and consensus mechanism, operating as an L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. Monad is "fully EVM bytecode compatible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a> and seeks to contribute improvements back to Ethereum via EIPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. They plan to address security flaws by:
*   Reducing development costs so developers can implement more checks and avoid compromising security for gas optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   Adding special instructions to the VM (e.g., to mark contracts as non-reentrant), which is possible due to their L1 architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.

## Focus on Collaboration and Growth

There is a growing consensus that the blockchain ecosystem [[need_for_performant_blockchain | needs more collaboration]] and less tribalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The execution layer, particularly among different VMs like Monad VM, EVM, MoveVM, and Solana VM, is seen as a "friendliest layer" where builders are not engaged in "Twitter Wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Projects are focusing on "growing the pie, not fighting over the pieces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>, aiming to enable more use cases and allow developers to choose the best environment for their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

## [[Future potential of blockchain applications and adoption | Future Potential of Blockchain Applications and Adoption]]

The industry is reaching a point where infrastructure is "99% there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, making it ready to unlock actual applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. Key areas identified for disruption include:

*   **Payments:** Blockchains are poised to disrupt cross-border payments, offering more efficient and affordable alternatives to traditional services like Western Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. Innovations like account abstraction and better wallet experiences are crucial for mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.
*   **Retail Trading:** On-chain order books for retail trading are becoming viable, offering slippages that make sense for both users and market makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   **Gaming:** While previous attempts often involved Ponzi mechanics, the future of Web3 gaming lies in building "fun games" first and then integrating blockchain components for asset and state tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. The goal is to move beyond speculative models to sustainable economics and unique social coordination experiences that do not solely revolve around financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.
*   **Social Applications:** Unique use cases like Friend.Tech, while perhaps not long-term, have prompted thinking about how to leverage blockchain for social attention and experiences beyond traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

The breaking down of tribalism and the focus on collaborative development of [[opportunities_for_application_development_on_highperformance_blockchains | high-performance blockchains]] indicate a maturing industry ready for broader adoption and the deployment of "killer apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

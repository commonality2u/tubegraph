When posed a [[creative_hypothetical_scenarios | hypothetical question]] about a band name for the [[merging_animal_concepts | Monad animals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, Fitz, who works on the Monad ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, found the query to be "super tough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Difficulty in Naming

Fitz admitted to not being sufficiently creative to devise such names "in short order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The process of attempting to answer involved thinking about references from classic metal bands, specifically mentioning Black Sabbath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Ultimately, Fitz concluded that more time would be needed to consider the question, and an immediate answer could not be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

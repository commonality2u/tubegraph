The [[monad_public_testnet_introduction | Monad public testnet]] is now live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Users can perform day-one actions starting from the [[monad_testnet_launch | Monad testnet]] landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, accessible at `testnet.monad.xyz` or through `monad.testnet.phantom.me` for [[integration_of_phantom_with_monad_testnet | Phantom Wallet]] users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Connecting Your Wallet

The first step on the [[monad_testnet_launch | testnet]] landing page is to [[connecting_a_wallet_to_the_monad_testnet | connect your wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While some wallets offer native [[monad_testnet_launch | testnet]] support, others may require manual network addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This process is simplified by a button that allows for auto-addition of the [[monad_testnet_launch | testnet]] to wallets like Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Acquiring Testnet Tokens via the Faucet

Once connected, the next step is to acquire testnet tokens through the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This is done by pasting your public address and clicking "Get Testnet Mon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

*   The amount of tokens claimable varies based on several parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   The faucet refreshes daily, so users are encouraged to check back regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Making Your First Transaction

After obtaining testnet Mon tokens, users can make their first trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The [[monad_testnet_launch | testnet]] landing page features three meme coins for trading: Mandac, Makaki, and Chog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These coins can be purchased directly on the landing page thanks to Blinks by Dialect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, and are powered by Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. An example transaction, such as buying Chogs, demonstrates the speed of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Exploring Beyond Your First Transaction

After the initial transaction, a multitude of [[featured_applications_and_experiences_on_monad_testnet | experiences]] are available on the [[monad_testnet_launch | testnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

*   **Spotlight Experiences:** On day one, these include Fantasy Top, with a tournament starting soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Featured Apps:** The main landing page lists [[featured_applications_and_experiences_on_monad_testnet | featured apps]] such as Rare Bet, Sports 42, KY, Kuru, and Curv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Directory:** An ecosystem directory provides an updated list of new apps and [[featured_applications_and_experiences_on_monad_testnet | experiences]] throughout the [[monads_plans_for_testnet_and_mainnet | testnet phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Users are encouraged to frequently revisit this page to discover new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

The purpose of the [[monad_testnet_launch | testnet]] is to deploy new app [[featured_applications_and_experiences_on_monad_testnet | experiences]] and test them in a lower-stakes, lower-risk production environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Users are encouraged to try out various dApps and provide feedback to teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

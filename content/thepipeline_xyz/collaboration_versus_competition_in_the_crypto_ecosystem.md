The crypto industry has historically been characterized by intense competition and tribalism, particularly among different blockchain projects and ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>. However, there appears to be a shift towards a more collaborative mindset within the [[the_role_of_community_in_the_crypto_industry | crypto community]], especially among builders of foundational infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Era of Tribalism

In past cycles, there was significant public animosity and "Twitter Wars" among different Layer 1 blockchains, as well as between various data availability (DA) and settlement layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:07">[15:05:07]</a>. This competitive environment often involved projects "shilling" their own "bags" rather than focusing on genuine technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:57">[15:46:57]</a>. For example, Ethereum and Solana were often at each other's throats, which ultimately was not beneficial for either ecosystem or the broader space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.

The previous perception of crypto by the general public as a "niche scam" focused on "selling monkey pictures online" was exacerbated by this internal fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:19">[19:19:19]</a>.

## The Shift Towards Collaboration

Currently, there's a growing sentiment that the industry needs more collaboration to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. Many in the space are "tired of fighting with each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:07">[16:39:07]</a>. This shift is particularly evident at the execution layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:46">[15:00:46]</a>.

Rousi, co-founder of Movement Labs, notes that VMS like Monad VM, EVM, Move VM, and Solana VM are not engaged in public disputes, largely because these "next-gen VMS" are recognized as interesting pieces of technology developed with significant research for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:23">[15:21:23]</a>.

> "Everyone just hates the old EVM, that's like the common consensus no matter where you go, the old EVM needs to burn, taken behind the barn and shot, like there's no other way for it to live." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>

## Benefits of Collaboration

The primary benefits of a collaborative approach include:

*   **Moving the Space Forward**: Working together enables more significant progress for the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:51">[17:50:51]</a>.
*   **Mutual Learning and Improvement**: Projects can learn from each other's designs and innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. For instance, Solana's improvements were partly due to respecting Ethereum and addressing decentralization concerns raised by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. Newer execution chains are also contributing features back to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>.
*   **Growing the Pie**: Instead of fighting over existing users, collaboration aims to expand the overall market and onboard more people into crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:27:00">[32:27:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Problem Solving**: The emphasis shifts to solving specific [[challenges_and_strategies_for_crypto_startups | problems]] and building robust environments, leaving the choice to developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

## Coexistence and Specialization

The idea is not that one blockchain will "win," but that different solutions can coexist and cater to different needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>. For example, if a developer is accustomed to SVM (Solana Virtual Machine), they will likely use Solana; if they are an EVM developer, they might choose a project like Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>. This approach fosters market expansion rather than direct competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>.

Developers are encouraged to check out various communities, including Movement Labs and Monad, to explore available options and contribute to bringing new products to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:18:00">[44:18:00]</a>. The hope is that this [[role_of_community_and_collaboration_in_crypto_projects | collaborative mindset]] will persist even into the next bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

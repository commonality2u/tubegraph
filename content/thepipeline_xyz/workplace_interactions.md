Workplace interactions can involve various activities, including attempts to identify colleagues.

## Identifying Colleagues

An activity observed included participants attempting to identify colleagues by name or characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This activity involved naming individuals such as "Karma C" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, "Stan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, "Joey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, "Jack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, and "Annie" or "Anise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Participants faced challenges in identifying some individuals, with one participant stating, "I don't know that on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> and suggesting to "skip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> others. Despite difficulties, encouragement like "good job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> was offered. The interaction suggests a form of [[guessing_coworkers_in_an_office_setting | guessing coworkers in an office setting]] or an [[office_teambuilding_games | office teambuilding game]] where participants engage in a lighthearted manner, as indicated by laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, suggesting a [[fun_team_activities | fun team activity]].

Monad Games is described as a "high stakes, no holds bar competition" where five contestants compete to earn test net tokens, also known as T-Mo or mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The ultimate winner receives $5,000 to give away to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The show features a series of unique and often bizarre [[competitions_and_surprise_challenges_in_monad_games|competitions and surprise challenges]] designed to test the contestants' mettle, with dire consequences for those who end up in last place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Contestants enter with varying degrees of confidence, from "very confident" to a "50/50 chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Initial Difficulty Selection

Before the games begin, contestants are given a choice between two difficulties for their first challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:
*   **Easy Route**: Worth 200 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Represented by pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Hard Route**: Worth 1,000 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Represented by blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

All contestants unanimously chose the hard route, embracing their self-proclaimed title of "degenerate gamblers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Challenges Featured

### Cookie Carving ("Squid Games" Style)

This challenge tasks contestants with carefully carving out a design from a cookie within 7 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Rules**: Inspired by *Squid Games*, contestants immediately lose if they break their cookie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Difficulty**: As all chose the "hard" option, they faced a more intricate design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Strategies**: Contestants employed various methods, including licking the cookie to thin it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Outcomes**: Despite initial confidence, some contestants broke their cookies, leading to elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### John's Mystery Meat (Eating Challenge)

A chance for contestants to earn additional tokens by being "brave enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Task**: Each contestant is served a random, unknown meat and must eat it to earn 100 montans (tokens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. All meats are safe to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Mystery Meats**: The list of potential meats included: alligator, bison, yak, kangaroo, wild boar, rabbit, rattlesnake, antelope, venison, Rocky Mountain oysters (bull balls), and chicken sausage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Reactions**: Contestants faced their fears, experiencing unique tastes and textures, with some finding certain meats "awful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Hot or Not (Pitch Competition)

This challenge assesses contestants' influence and pitching abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, featuring aspects of a [[pitch_competition_aspects|pitch competition]].
*   **Task**: Pick a random prompt for a non-existent startup and pitch it to the group within 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. The other contestants judge and score the pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Added Stakes**: There are three "heat" levels associated with the pitch, each requiring the contestant to consume a spicy item for higher token rewards:
    *   Jelly beans: 200 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
    *   World's hottest chocolate: 500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

*   **Penalty**: If a contestant drinks yogurt (relief) before the time is up, they don't get points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Outcomes**: Danny, attempting the world's hottest chocolate, struggled significantly during his pitch for "Only NADS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. The "intern" won the round with their "Couch Confessional" pitch, earning 1,500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

### Ice Block Seed Phrase (Problem Solving)

A challenge requiring dexterity and quick thinking.
*   **Task**: Contestants must break open a block of ice containing eight words of a seed phrase within 10 minutes, then correctly order the seed phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. The words are numbered to aid in ordering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
*   **Tools**: Contestants select a tool to help them break the ice, ranging from versatile options to less obvious choices like a spoon or keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   **Rules**: There are no restrictions on how they can break the ice, including throwing it on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   **Strategies**: Some attempted to melt the ice, while others focused on physical breakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. The concept of bribing other contestants for words was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.
*   **Stakes**: This round was "all or nothing," worth 1,500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Danny won the challenge after a bribe for the last word, but later stated he received it for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

### Split or Steal (Psychological Challenge)

The final game is psychological and worth the most tokens: 2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. This represents a [[high_stakes_competition_and_reward_system|high stakes competition and reward system]].
*   **Task**: Each contestant privately chooses to "split" or "steal" their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.
*   **Rules and Outcomes**:
    *   If everyone chooses "split," they each receive 500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
    *   If only one person chooses "steal," they take all the tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
    *   If two or more people choose "steal," the splitters get everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
    *   If three or more people choose "steal," no one wins anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.
*   **Nature**: Described as a "game of trust, strategy, and maybe a little backstabbing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>, highlighting the [[psychological_elements_and_strategy_in_game_contests|psychological elements and strategy in game contests]].
*   **Outcome**: Ultimately, Danny and Spam chose to "steal," while Pre-Balling, Intern, and KB chose to "split" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. This configuration meant the splitters received everything. However, Danny, as the overall token leader, won the entire Monad Games, securing the $5,000 for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>. In an unexpected move, Danny then decided to split his $5,000 prize among three other Monad community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

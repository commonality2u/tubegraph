The Monad ecosystem presents a significant amount of opportunity, with many people potentially "sleeping on" the full extent of available prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is hoped that many [[community_involvement_and_opportunities_in_the_monad_ecosystem | community members]] will be hired natively within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This abundance of opportunities is considered a key point of differentiation for the [[monad_community_opportunities | Monad community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Specific Roles

On the Eco marketing side, nearly every team building on Monad is actively seeking assistance with social media marketing and [[roles_and_tasks_within_the_manad_community | community help]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Demand for Monad-Native Talent

There is a strong emphasis on hiring individuals who are not only [[opportunities_and_careers_within_blockchain_communities | crypto native]] but specifically "Monad native" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This highlights a need for people who deeply understand the Monad environment and can help drive various initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Real-World Example

A specific instance illustrates this demand: for an upcoming event designed to "rally the nads," a need arose for someone from the Monad side to help run it, as key figures like Bill Mund are not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Within a few days, a [[monad_community_opportunities | Monad Community member]] secured a [[opportunities_and_careers_within_blockchain_communities | full-time job working in crypto]] as a direct result of this demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This exemplifies the "truly endless" nature of opportunities, which is expected to be a significant trend in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

When asked about a [[dream_app_ideas_for_monad | dream app]] on Monad, Omar, who works on the ecosystem team, envisioned a specific type of application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Omar's [[ideas_for_a_dream_app_on_monad | Dream App Idea]]:
> I'd like a [[dream_technology_or_application | dream app]] that can tokenize everything at a very niche level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This would include the ability to tokenize a daily jog or create bets with friends on various activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Omar believes the future involves the tokenization of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. He would like to see interesting developments in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Crypto communities, particularly in projects like Monad, are actively integrating social and financial elements to foster engagement, reward contributions, and create a vibrant ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach goes beyond traditional marketing, focusing on organic growth and the direct conversion of social capital into tangible opportunities.

## Community-Driven Growth and Opportunities
The Monad community emphasizes a "by the community" approach, where members are encouraged to contribute and participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This environment has led to the emergence of key contributors whose talents are recognized and utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

A significant aspect of this integration is the direct pathway from community engagement to paid roles within the ecosystem. Projects building on Monad are actively seeking to hire community and marketing personnel from within the existing Monad community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This is seen as a "well of talent" due to members' deep understanding of the project's lore and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, carrying significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Some examples of opportunities include:
*   Winning meme competitions leading to greater involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Getting paid to be a meme maker or community person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Full-time job opportunities within crypto for active community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   The Monad community serving as an "incubator for top talent" in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

This model allows individuals to "maximize your luck surface area" by consistently engaging with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Evolution of Community Platforms
The Monad community has evolved across various platforms, each contributing to its unique social and engagement dynamics:
*   **Discord**: Initially an invite-only platform, it later opened up, leading to a significant inflow of new members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. The Discord also hosted events like the "Obab game initiative," fostering community interaction through gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
*   **Telegram**: Started as a fully public chat in December 2022, then became private around April 2023. This led to the introduction of meme competitions, more "shitposting," and ultimately the "Purge" and "Purgatory" systems to manage membership, accumulating over 2 million messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Twitter**: A crucial platform for sharing art and content, though some members express concern about excessive tagging for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The community encourages authentic engagement over spamming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

The ability for community members to contribute in various ways across different platforms is a key strength, allowing individuals to "stay in their lane and hammer what they do best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. This parallels the future on-chain verticals like DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and social applications expected on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

## Future Integration: SocialFi and Gaming
The community anticipates a deeper integration of social and financial elements, particularly in gaming. The idea of "financialization of fun" means that off-chain activities like co-creation, identity maximization, and meme-making will increasingly translate to on-chain experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

This includes:
*   Trading [[The relationship between crypto and social media | NFTs]] with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   Grinding levels in games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   Playing poker on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

The focus is on "community initiatives coming on chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>, enhancing the social aspect of financial interactions. This approach seeks to provide a frictionless user experience (UX) and leverage the strong community aspect for greater adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

## Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs)
Beyond social integration, the community is excited about the potential of Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs) on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>. CLOBs allow for a fully on-chain order book for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Unlike current Automated Market Maker (AMM) systems necessitated by high gas fees, Monad's high Transactions Per Second (TPS) and low fees make it economically viable for market makers to provide liquidity on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. This promises deeper liquidity and better execution for traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. This represents a significant jump in performance and enables use cases that can only exist in a high-performance execution environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

The community's success is attributed to recognizing and fostering talent, and maintaining strong interpersonal relationships. Key pieces of advice shared include:

*   **Find your people and stick to your thing**: Avoid scattering efforts due to noise; focus on what you do best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.

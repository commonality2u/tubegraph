The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology is gaining substance, moving beyond just being a buzzword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. This emerging field presents significant opportunities for new applications and shifts in how digital economies function.

## Overview of the Intersection

The dynamic nature of crypto, characterized by ever-changing "metas" that rise and fall, provides a fertile ground for exploring new technologies like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Phantom, a widely used crypto app, believes that Monad can carry the torch for the future of the EVM, bringing a composable Layer 1 environment where teams can work together to build a sum greater than individual parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. This collaborative spirit could extend to AI integrations, as wallets guide users to different dApps and actions on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>.

## Key Use Cases and Future Outlook

### AI Agents and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

A significant potential intersection lies in the realm of AI agents and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). While DAOs from previous cycles were often managed by groups of people in Discord, AI offers the means for truly automated operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. AI agents could roam the world, making payments using crypto, which is seen as a very natural and logical progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Humans would then provide support, recalibration, redirection, or funding for specific initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

### Censorship Resistance and Large Language Models (LLMs)

One of the most compelling characteristics of crypto that AI could tap into first is censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. AI models may experience a "Napster/Limewire moment," where tools emerge to bypass content moderation, DMCA usage restrictions, and other controls imposed by mainstream models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Uncensored Large Language Models (LLMs) could utilize blockchains to ensure no central server can shut them down, potentially going viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>. The more power big firms wield by combining AI and centralized control, the more attractive censorship-resistant methods will become for end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

### Frictionless Payments and On-Chain Economy

Currently, there's a "wall" between the crypto world and traditional finance, making on-ramping and off-ramping assets relatively painful and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. If AI can move to the crypto side of this wall, it could bring a significant portion of the economy on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. This would eliminate the need to bridge funds from traditional finance to DeFi, with everything existing natively in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

AI agents could frictionlessly pay for paid APIs by sending crypto to an address or buying credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. This could lead to businesses increasingly accepting crypto, transitioning towards a crypto-to-crypto peer-to-peer world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.

One intriguing [[hypothetical_scenarios_and_personal_choices | hypothetical scenario]] explores the nature of dreams and their connection to alternate realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Dreams as Journeys to Alternate Realities

If it were discovered that every time one dreams, they are actually visiting alternate realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, a specific question arises regarding which of these dream realities one would choose to revisit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

> "If you found out that every time you dream you're actually visiting alternate realities, which dream would you choose to visit again?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

The specific dream chosen to revisit is referred to as the "Gary Indiana dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The reasoning behind this [[hypothetical_choices_and_their_reasoning | choice]] is a stated affection for Gary, Indiana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, possibly reflecting [[city_dreams_and_aspirations | aspirations]] or positive associations with the city.

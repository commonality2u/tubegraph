This article explores the experiences and [[Bitcoin and Ethereum trading strategies | crypto trading strategies]] of prominent [[the_importance_of_crypto_twitter_for_trading | Crypto Twitter]] figures, Anom and Kevin (also known as @intern), discussing market dynamics, successful trades, and advice for new users.

## Introduction to the Traders
Anom and Kevin are well-known figures on [[the_importance_of_crypto_twitter_for_trading | Crypto Twitter]], recognized for their legendary presence and trading insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Anom's [[the_importance_of_crypto_twitter_for_trading | Crypto Twitter]] account saw significant growth, expanding from around 3,000 followers before the last cycle to over 100,000 by its end, primarily by sharing his trades publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Kevin has also experienced rapid follower growth, gaining 30-35K in a single month recently, indicating a return of retail participants to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Anom's Crypto Background
Anom's introduction to crypto began during his studies at Georgia Tech, where he pursued Computer Science and a minor in Business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He learned about Bitcoin in an emergency technologies class around 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. After graduating and working as a software engineer, his mentor, who was heavily involved in crypto trading, encouraged him to delve deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Anom began researching more intensely and traded crypto on the side until mid-2021, when he transitioned to full-time trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Growth
The recent rapid market movement has surprised many traders who navigated the bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The crypto industry faced severe setbacks in 2022, including the FTX collapse and widespread lender failures, compounded by Federal Reserve rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Despite stocks returning to all-time highs, crypto is still down 50% from its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The influx of new participants is contributing to the quick repricing of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Successful Trading Experiences
Anom's trading track record includes a period of consecutive successful calls, particularly evident around April or May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. His high-conviction calls, like Solana at $20, have seen significant pumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Axi Infinity Trade
One of Anom's most impactful trades was Axi Infinity (AXS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Despite initial skepticism about crypto gaming and viewing Axi as a potential scam, he successfully flipped his bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. He entered the trade around $12 in mid-2021, a period when he was bearish on most altcoins after being hit hard in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Axi was the only altcoin making new highs, a month before the broader market flipped, leading him to reassess his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The trade was successful, with AXS eventually surpassing $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Solana Trade
Following his success with Axi, Anom transitioned to Solana, another one of his best trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. He got long on Solana when other altcoins started following Axi's lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Anom emphasized the importance of having alerts on all tickers, as altcoin leaders often hint at market direction shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Being invested in leaders can allow traders to disregard broader market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Trading Philosophy and Overcoming Bias
Anom emphasizes trusting his own opinion above others in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. He advises against counter-trading sentiment, as it can lead to losses, especially in erratic bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. His core philosophy is to stick to one's own process and consistently journal trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Journaling helps in referencing one's initial thought process when emotions may cloud judgment during volatile periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

Anom's approach blends price action and fundamental analysis, with a leaning towards price action for actual position taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. He avoids heavy long-term investment in fundamentally unsound charts but may take momentum trades on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. He maintains a diversified portfolio, with about 70% in fundamentally strong assets like Solana, Coinbase, and Bitcoin, and a smaller portion allocated to momentum plays based on market narratives and retail behavior, even for projects he doesn't personally value, such as Cardano or Hex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## Market Narratives and Future Outlook
Anom identifies several strong market narratives for the upcoming cycle:
*   **Layer 1 (L1) Chains**: The L1 narrative remains strong, exemplified by Solana and Avalanche, due to their advantages over Ethereum in terms of cost, speed, performance, and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   **Layer 2 (L2) Solutions**: L2s are also a significant narrative, working to compete with L1s like Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.
*   **Modular Blockchain Thesis**: This involves projects like Celestia, which focuses on being a modular data availability layer, potentially making it cheaper for rollups to post data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. EIP-4844 for Ethereum is expected to significantly reduce rollup transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

The competition between L1s and L2s for user onboarding will be intense, as users typically have no allegiance to a particular chain and will gravitate towards the best applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. The vast majority of potential crypto users are not yet involved, indicating a significant opportunity for mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

### Enabling Mass Adoption Through Applications
For crypto to achieve mass adoption, it needs to support applications that can handle millions of daily active users, similar to top iOS apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Ethereum L1 currently handles about 1 million transactions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. While Bitcoin opened up the concept of peer-to-peer cash, Ethereum expanded imagination to smart contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. However, environments capable of supporting true mass-user apps, like Solana's high throughput and low fees, have only existed since late 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

The focus is shifting to applications. Promising areas for mass adoption include:
*   **Drip House**: A free NFT platform on Solana that allows artists to release art weekly using compressed NFTs, onboarding users to Solana's ecosystem by being completely free and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
*   **Social Apps**: Anom believes crypto can offer better incentive alignment for users and creators compared to traditional social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   **Stablecoins and Payments**: This is seen as one of crypto's largest and most uniquely enabled markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. Solutions like yield-bearing stablecoins (e.g., Mountain Protocol, Ondo) offer objective advantages over traditional payment systems like Venmo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **Gaming (e.g., Parallel)**: Projects like Parallel are focusing on a "Trojan horse" strategy by offering a game playable by traditional gamers without requiring crypto knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Gamers can optionally buy in-game assets as NFTs later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
*   **Sports Betting**: This industry stands to benefit from crypto's advantages, offering a better user experience for gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

A major [[Challenges and opportunities in cryptocurrency investment | challenge]] is overcoming the public perception of NFTs and crypto as scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. Good applications alone might not be enough; more voices are needed to convey crypto's value in an understandable way to the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

## Top Signals and Market Cycles
Identifying top signals in the upcoming market will be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. Past cycles saw celebrities and high-profile figures shilling projects like FTX, which later proved to be a top signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. However, if the current cycle leads to genuine product-market fit and mass adoption through daily-use applications, widespread support for crypto might be a confirmation of growth rather than a top signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Anom plans to primarily rely on technical analysis to determine market tops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.

Regarding potential "Luna-type" events, Anom hopes for fewer easily breakable mechanisms and more caution from the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>. While [[the_impact_of_leverage_in_crypto_trading | leverage]] events and flash crashes will always occur in crypto, the goal is to avoid major top-tier coins collapsing to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. The industry is moving towards greater transparency, with newer exchanges like Backpack focusing on verifiable balances and fund access to prevent issues similar to FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>.

## Advice for New Crypto Entrants
For internet-native individuals without a finance or software engineering background, Anom offers the following advice to get involved safely:
1.  **Get a Hardware Wallet**: Essential for [[navigating_risk_and_security_in_crypto_investments | securely storing crypto]]. Recommended options include Trezor or Lattice, as Ledger has had recent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
2.  **Get Active on [[the_importance_of_crypto_twitter_for_trading | Crypto Twitter]]**: While overwhelming, it's a rich source of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>.
3.  **Form a Group**: Engage with a group of friends interested in crypto to navigate information, bounce questions, and make the experience more enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.
4.  **Set Up Coinbase Account**: A good starting point for new users with tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
5.  **Start Small and Experiment**: Buy a small amount of crypto and start using applications to understand the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. Examples of apps to try include:
    *   Drip House (free NFT platform) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>
    *   MarginFi (deposit funds for yield on lending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>
    *   Drift or Zeta (for trading) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>
    *   Jupiter (for token swaps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>
    *   Tensor (for trading NFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>
6.  **Utilize Educational Resources**: Listen to podcasts, such as Blockworks, which often feature founders explaining their projects' importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

No technical background is required to use most crypto applications, though it helps in understanding underlying trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.

## Sappy Seals and Play Ember Partner on Monad Testnet

Sappy Seals and Play Ember are partnering to bring a new gaming experience to the Monad Testnet [01:43:40]. The collaboration has been in the works for about six months [01:06:40]. This partnership stems from a meeting between Wob, founder of Sappy Seals, and John Hook, co-founder of Play Ember, at a gaming NFT Meetup [02:08:11]. Wob recognized Play Ember's extensive experience in game development and their ability to scale products, reaching a large user base [02:41:00].

The collaboration aims to combine Play Ember's game-building expertise with Sappy Seals' "rabid community" [03:03:00]. The initial concept for their game, currently code-named "Sappy Quest," is an RPG-style dungeon crawler [03:48:00].

### Why [[gaming_and_crypto_integration | Gaming and Crypto Integration]]?

Wob views gaming as a logical fit for [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | blockchain technology]] because it involves digital economies and the exchange of tokenized assets on-chain [04:51:00]. He considers gaming a strong use case for crypto, noting past successes like Axie Infinity and activities in projects like Prime and Parallel [05:20:00]. For Sappy Seals, integrating their IP into gaming allows them to deliver scalable experiences that captivate people, offering a "slice of that experience" to a wider audience [06:12:00].

John Hook emphasizes that [[gaming_and_crypto_integration | gaming is an obvious way]] to onboard casual users to [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | blockchain-powered experiences]] [07:28:00]. He believes that while complex [[onchain_gaming | onchain gaming]] exists, there will also be a significant segment of "lighter touch experiences" for a more casual audience, similar to Web2 casual games [08:25:00]. Hook stresses the importance of great IP, like Sappy Seals, for players to download and enjoy a game, encouraging repeat engagement and exploration of related digital content [08:56:00].

Wob states that gaming gives people "something to do on chain that's interesting" [11:00:00]. He argues that engagement with crypto games and IPs can lead users to further engagement with crypto as a whole, seeing it as less "bad" [11:15:00].

### Challenges and Opportunities in Web3 Gaming

The current state of Web3 gaming faces challenges, primarily due to the perceived risk of crypto, which disincentivizes talented game developers [12:38:00]. Many early [[the_evolution_and_future_of_web_3_gaming | crypto games]] have been "not that good," leading to a perception that [[gaming_and_crypto_integration | crypto games suck]] [12:49:00]. However, this is seen as a phase of "natural growing pains" in the industry, which is expected to mature as the industry becomes less risky [12:56:00].

John Hook envisions a future where casual gamers engage with blockchain games, earning in-game currency that might lead them to explore other crypto communities related to art, music, or cars [14:02:00]. He advocates for cross-collaborations between gaming, community, and infrastructure projects to achieve this broader adoption [15:15:00].

## The Role of NFTs in Gaming and Identity

NFTs are seen as crucial for creating unique digital identities and assets within blockchain ecosystems [31:55:00]. While initial excitement focused on art or capturing moments (like NBA Top Shot), the market shifted towards viewing NFTs as financial primitives for investment or token vesting [35:34:00].

However, the "death" of NFTs is contested. Wob points out the irony that many NFT critics still use NFT profile pictures [34:49:00]. He argues that while [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | meme coins]] might die off once their momentum fades, NFTs, even in "dead" communities, often retain a "strange human psychology sort of attachment" and emotional feeling [33:01:00]. This psychological element, though not quantifiable on-chain, is considered very important [33:25:00].

### The Importance of Culture and Community

For Sappy Seals, a key driver is the "culture piece" that defines why people care about an NFT or project [26:50:00]. This culture attracts "value add" individuals who can produce content or contribute in unique ways [27:07:00].

Wob describes this as creating something that attracts people who find it interesting, building an "aura" and a "collective of people" united behind a shared passion [27:30:00]. He likens being a "Seal Maxi" to being an "eth Maxi" or "Solana Maxi," highlighting how these digital identities become intertwined with people's lifestyles and online presence [27:57:00].

Blockquote:
> "You spend every waking hour that you spend on Twitter or whatever, which is tends to be five plus hours for a lot of people on a day-to-day basis is a lot of time right spending it in the metaverse and that is your identity that's your passport that's who you are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>

The value of an NFT or token is assigned by the "total network value" of its individual nodes and contributors [28:44:00]. It's about how much "this dude is great at memes" or how valuable a "whale" who can "ape our floor" is to the collective [28:56:00]. The goal is to "increase the network value" by creating interesting things that attract more people [29:25:00].

John Hook attributes Sappy Seals' success to its culture, memes, and creativity, noting a significant number of gamers within the community even before his partnership with Wob [16:10:00]. He also values working with brands that have a clear vision, like Sappy Seals, which makes collaborations easier [27:28:00].

Wob observes that Sappy Seals' community has a natural affinity for gaming, partly because meme culture and online personas lend themselves to a "gamer persona" [19:37:00]. This has resulted in high retention rates for Sappy Seals in collaborations with other gaming projects, such as Nifty Island and Pirate Nation [21:20:00]. The community's willingness to help "platform" strong builders and "bolster initial traction" is a core philosophy [20:33:00].

The Monad community is also seen as having the "right persona types"—creatives and experimental individuals—who will contribute to the chain's traction post-launch through meme coins, NFTs, and general content [23:00:00]. The combination of Play Ember's gaming community, Sappy Seals' gaming and content-producing community, and Monad's meme-driven community is expected to push beyond the crypto bubble [23:51:00].

The cultivation of the "right user persona" and understanding what experiences will "delight and excite them" is paramount [24:48:00]. This "deliberate curation of the community" is seen as a missing piece in many crypto gaming projects [25:33:00].

## The Future Trajectory

The conversation suggests that the future of Web3 innovation, particularly in gaming, will look "so much different" from traditional Web2 models [44:35:00]. It won't be "Call of Duty with coins," but a "completely different thing that no one's ever seen before" [46:27:00]. This is aligned with the concept of "skamorphic" design, where new technology is retrofitted to look like older models, hindering true innovation [45:55:00].

The ability to build brands "hand in hand" with the community, allowing them to "freestyle and create stuff," is a unique and enjoyable aspect of Web3 development [49:04:00]. This grassroots approach means authenticity cannot be faked with just money, creating a "death wall" for products that lack genuine community belief [50:38:00]. Authenticity is deemed the "most valuable currency" in a world saturated with attention-grabbing content [51:37:00].

While the "Giga level of speculation" for NFTs (e.g., $500,000 profile pictures) may not return due to dispersed attention and liquidity, the market can be reinvigorated through unique innovations that give "something to the world that's unique" [54:50:00]. Wob believes that people need to focus on what matters and create new things to push the market forward and bring back attention [55:17:00].

The **Pulse** team is developing a [[consumer_crypto_products | consumer-facing product]] that combines both software and hardware to address [[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | data privacy]] in the wearables market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The product is described as a lifestyle wearable focused on maximizing productivity rather than solely health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## User Data Ownership and Rewards

A key motivation for **Pulse** stems from the observation that users of traditional wearable and health data services (like Whoop, Fitbit, Aura, and 23andMe) are not rewarded for the data they generate, while these companies often sell it for millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. **Pulse** aims to rectify this imbalance by leveraging [[challenges_and_strategies_in_building_crypto_infrastructure | crypto rails]] to create a transparent mechanism for data brokerage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

With **Pulse**, users are notified when a third party, such as the University of Oxford, wishes to acquire their data for purposes like clinical studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Users can then review the opportunity and decide whether to license their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This system ensures transparency regarding what data is shared, for how long, and for what purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

This approach provides a unique advantage by inherently baking incentives into the data system, solving transparency issues related to data brokerage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The team describes this model as "live to earn," where users are compensated for the value derived from their daily life data, even if they aren't actively engaging in health activities like going to the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. The goal is to build a comprehensive "Health digital twin" by eventually incentivizing users to contribute blood work, DNA, and electronic health records to the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

### Data Security and Encryption

A core aspect of **Pulse**'s design is **[[protecting_sensitive_data_and_credentials | data security]]**. The aim is to store as much data as possible encrypted on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. Through technologies like Multiparty Computation (MPC) powered encryption and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), only the user can decrypt their dataâ€”not even the **Pulse** team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

This ensures user confidence that their data remains encrypted and safe from hacks or leakages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>. FHE also allows users to gain insights from their data without risking exposure to third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. This approach directly addresses the vulnerabilities seen in traditional platforms, which have experienced major data breaches like the 23andMe hack and the Change Healthcare hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>. According to the team, [[challenges_and_strategies_in_building_crypto_infrastructure | crypto rails]] solve these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

## Building Community with Crypto

The **Pulse** team views [[the_relationship_between_crypto_and_social_media | crypto]] as a powerful tool for forming culture and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. Unlike traditional startups that might need to pay users to "dog food" their product and build a community, crypto's inherent ownership mechanisms (e.g., token ownership, data ownership) foster strong communities naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

This community-building advantage helps **Pulse** to:
*   Galvanize a hardcore community of super fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.
*   Get user feedback and shape product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   Grow and scale by leveraging community to reach critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

By building on Monad, the team has found an existing community that is already "pilled on the value that [[consumer_crypto_products | consumer crypto]] can bring," eliminating the need to convince users of its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. This alignment with the Monad community's focus on health, wellness, and optimizing productivity for the long term has been a strategic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

Pike Finance has a unique, community-driven NFT project that fosters identity and belonging among its members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. While Pike is primarily a DeFi protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, this NFT collection has become a significant aspect of its vibrant community.

## Origin and Development
The idea for a Pike NFT collection emerged entirely from the community, specifically within the general chat on Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. The team explicitly states they had "nothing to do with this NFT project" and that it was "completely Community Driven from the very first day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

A community member named Mojo took the initiative, despite having no prior experience launching an NFT project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. He began sharing sketches and asking for community feedback on ideas and traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. This collaborative process allowed the "Pik neans" (the name of the NFT collection) to "come to life just within the community itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

## Role of the Team
Despite not being directly involved in its creation, the Pike team actively supports and elevates all community efforts, including the NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. They have been "very explicit and always have been this is not a team like NFT project" and do not financially back it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. However, they amplify it where they can, demonstrating that they are also community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Team members often use the Pik neans as their profile pictures (PFPs), showing their solidarity and desire to rally around the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. This reflects the philosophy that everyone, whether part of the team or the broader community, is "one entity" striving for the same goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## Impact on Community Building
The Pik neans NFT project has had a significant impact on the Pike community:
*   **Identity and Belonging** It has become a "Universal identity layer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, providing a tangible symbol that people can "latch on to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a> and a "sense of belonging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Holding a Pikan NFT instantly signals to others that one is a Pike Finance community member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.
*   **Organic Content Generation** The project exemplifies how a strong community can generate vast amounts of candid content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. Community members create memes, art, songs, and even physical items like cookies and nail art featuring Pike imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. This organic content keeps Pike "top of mind" for users without the team needing to resort to spamming or forced advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Engagement** The project's success is a testament to the [[Building Communities in Crypto | community building]] approach of prioritizing meaningful engagement over vanity metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. By allowing the community to shape its own culture and lore, the team fosters deep connections and genuine excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. This long-term focus, similar to that of Monad's [[building_and_engaging_community_in_crypto_spaces | community-building efforts]], ensures a loyal fan base that will persist regardless of product developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

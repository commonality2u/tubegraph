Developing a game presents significant hurdles, with the primary challenge often being the creation of an engaging product rather than the integration of specific technologies like blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Bottlenecks in Game Creation

A core [[game_development_in_web3 | bottleneck]] in game development is simply "creating a good game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The prevailing view is that developers should prioritize creating a "fun game first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, and only then consider adding on-chain components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This approach is exemplified by platforms like Roblox, which established a successful game before exploring integrations such as NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This emphasizes the [[importance_of_creating_fun_games_first | importance of creating fun games first]].

## Security Challenges in Traditional Game Economies

Beyond development, existing game economies face substantial [[security_issues_in_gaming_economies | security issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Examples include:
*   Gamers trading CS:GO skins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   The RuneScape gray market for gold, which has existed for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

In these markets, users frequently fall victim to scams, often resorting to insecure methods like wire transfers to anonymous individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These traditional systems are considered "much less secure than crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, leading to significant user losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

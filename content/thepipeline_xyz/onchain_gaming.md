Creating a game is considered more challenging than creating an [[onchain_elements_and_technology_used_in_monad_games | on-chain]] game, with the primary bottleneck being the development of a genuinely good game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A common mistake observed is developing [[onchain_elements_and_technology_used_in_monad_games | on-chain]] elements first before the core game is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Development Approach

The recommended approach is to first create a fun and engaging game, and only then integrate [[onchain_elements_and_technology_used_in_monad_games | on-chain]] components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For instance, the integration of [[the_integration_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_mobile_gaming | NFTs]] with a platform like Roblox makes sense because Roblox was developed first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Features like [[ingame_asset_trading_security | asset tracking]] become valuable once the game itself is popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## In-Game Asset Trading

Gamers have a long history of trading in-game assets, such as CS:GO skins or gold in the RuneScape gray market, which has existed for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, these traditional trading methods are highly insecure, often leading to users being scammed or requiring risky wire transfers to unknown individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. In contrast, [[gaming_and_crypto_integration | crypto]] offers a significantly more secure alternative for such transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Bold Leonidas, a prominent content creator in the crypto space, shares insights into his journey, emphasizing the importance of consistency, adaptation, and offering value as a creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>. His work, primarily comics, has gained significant traction, leading to an "explosion" in popularity over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.

## Early Beginnings and Evolution
Bold Leonidas's journey into content creation began somewhat organically, without a clear singular starting moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:21">[02:46:21]</a>. Initially, his work was inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. He started doing comics sporadically around August 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, producing about 30 or 40 in a month, but not every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

One of his first impactful comics was inspired by "Did Da Koku" (Gabriel Leydon), who bought a Super Bowl ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. He then found more traction with a comic about a Vitalik Buterin picture, which made him realize the potential of his creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

### Commitment to Daily Creation
A pivotal moment came on February 19th, when he committed to creating at least one comic every 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. This commitment stemmed from a desire to improve quickly and to be an "antithesis of AI" in art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Unlike AI-generated art, his comics are purposefully hand-drawn with human errors left in, as a way to prove they are made by a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. He ensures each comic is drawn new, never pulling from previous work, despite the time it consumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

This dedication to [[building_consistency_and_finding_inspiration_in_daily_content_creation | building consistency and finding inspiration in daily content creation]] was also inspired by other artists like Beeple, who is famous for his "everydays" collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. Bold's goal was to eventually surpass Beeple in the raw number of "everydays" created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:46]</a>. He often produces two or three comics a day to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

## Creative Process and Inspiration
Bold Leonidas's content focuses on providing humorous and often hilarious commentary on current events in crypto culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. He maintains a "pulse on the culture of crypto" to ensure his content remains timely and relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>.

To overcome creative blocks, he employs a strategy of redrawing and reformatting existing memes in his unique style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>. This approach allows him to "own" a version of the meme, making it identifiable as his creation and enabling wider sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>. He also strives for visual humor that works specifically in a comic format, rather than just text-based jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>.

### Adapting to Market Trends
Initially, his comics were almost entirely about the NFT ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. However, as NFT interest waned, he made a conscious decision to pivot towards broader crypto topics, including trading concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. This adaptability ensured his content remained relevant and engaging.

## The Crypto Journey
Bold's personal entry into crypto began with buying Ethereum, though he initially struggled to understand concepts like "on-chain" and gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>. His initial foray into NFTs involved trying to list traditional paintings on OpenSea, which taught him about gas costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. He found digital art compelling after discovering collections like the Mike Tyson/Corey VanLew collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. For him, the "coin side" of crypto was comparatively boring to NFTs initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.

He believes "crypto is the future of finance" and that mass adoption will occur when users don't even realize they're using blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56:00">[41:56:00]</a>. This includes seamless integration into experiences like games, where carrying digital "skins" across platforms is enabled by the blockchain without the user's explicit knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:33:00">[45:33:00]</a>.

## Community Engagement and Support
Bold Leonidas was an early supporter of the Monad community, having learned about it through a tight-knit private group of long-time crypto participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:44:00">[37:44:00]</a>. What drew him to Monad was its transparency and "humanness," with founders like Keone actively front and center, unlike anonymous projects prevalent in the NFT and meme coin spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:25:00">[38:25:00]</a>. The long-term building approach of Monad, with a projected launch far in the future, signaled a serious and bullish commitment, contrasting with projects that pump out releases quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:08:00]</a>. He sees the involvement of established figures like Intern and Tunes in Monad not as "influencer pulling" but as a sign that experienced people in the space are confident enough to commit to the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:38:00">[46:38:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Creators

> [!NOTE] Final Alpha for Aspiring Creators
> When trying to connect with an influencer or promote a project, don't just ask for something; **offer something** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:15:00">[51:15:00]</a>. Offering genuine value—whether it's unique content, helpful contributions, or engaging community activities—will naturally attract attention and foster collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:54:00">[51:54:00]</a>. Asking without offering, especially with low-value requests like "a whitelist for your crappy NFT project," is not effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:25:00">[51:25:00]</a>.

This [[advice for new content creators | advice for new content creators]] highlights the shift from an "extractive mindset" to an "offering mindset" as crucial for success in the crypto content space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:39:00">[51:39:00]</a>. Bold's own experience, where people started approaching him after he began offering value, supports this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:54:00">[51:54:00]</a>. He suggests that [[building_and_engaging_community_in_crypto_spaces | building and engaging community in crypto spaces]] can involve simple contributions like hosting quizzes or creating unique content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:38:00">[53:38:00]</a>.

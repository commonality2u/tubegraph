Interviews often feature [[hypothetical choices and their reasoning | hypothetical questions]] designed to elicit a candidate's thought process, creativity, or unconventional perspectives. These questions can range from personal beliefs to event planning scenarios.

## Examples of Hypothetical Questions

### Unconventional Beliefs
One [[unconventional_beliefs_interview_question | unconventional beliefs interview question]] asked is: "what's one unconventional belief that you have?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. An example response to this question involved the belief that "traumatized children are funnier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This perspective suggests that while not advocating for "deep trauma," a "little" hardship can lead to humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, arguing that a child who experiences only positive things might not develop a sense of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It was also noted that suffering can contribute to growth and "grit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Designing an Event for "Monad"
Another [[hypothetical scenarios and personal choices | hypothetical question]] discussed is, "if you could ask the next person anything, what would you want to ask them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The suggested question to pose is: "if they could throw any event for Monad, with no bars, what would they do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This type of [[fun hypothetical scenarios involving Monad | fun hypothetical scenarios involving Monad]] explores creativity and resourcefulness, falling under [[hypothetical questions about manad and band names | hypothetical questions about Monad and band names]].

[[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | Interoperability]] in the blockchain space has undergone a significant [[evolution_and_growth_of_the_cryptocurrency_market | evolution]], moving from centralized, insecure bridges to decentralized, secure messaging platforms. Axelar Network, founded by Georgios and Sergey, plays a key role in this transformation by connecting various blockchains and enabling seamless cross-chain interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

## Axelar Network: An Overview
Axelar is an [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] network structured as a blockchain that connects 56 blockchains and counting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. It functions as a messaging platform upon which cross-chain applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), money markets, and NFT marketplaces, can be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. Axelar is not a bridge itself but provides the infrastructure for bridging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## The Problem with Early Bridges
A few years ago, the [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] landscape was dominated by centralized bridges like Ren Protocol and MultiChain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. These bridges were prone to single points of failure, where a compromised key held by a centralized entity could lead to the loss of all funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This centralization was responsible for major hacks in the DeFi space, including the Harmony, Ronin, and MultiChain incidents, which collectively resulted in billions of dollars lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Axelar's Solution: Decentralized Message Passing
Axelar adopted a different approach by designing a blockchain based on the Cosmos SDK, which features a fully decentralized validator set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. To attack the network and steal funds, a majority of its 75 validators, including major validators from Ethereum mainnet, would need to be corrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This makes Axelar almost as secure as the chains it connects to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Axelar also offers a "many-to-many" connectivity model, allowing a single connection to the Axelar blockchain to route messages to any other connected blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. This contrasts with competitors like Wormhole, Chainlink CCIP, and Layer Zero, which typically offer only pairwise connectivity, making it harder to add new chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## Genesis of Axelar: Onboarding and User Experience
The inspiration behind Axelar's design came from the [[challenges_and_strategies_in_building_crypto_infrastructure | difficulties in onboarding users and developers]] to new blockchains like Algorand in late 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. A key problem was the lack of easy ways to bridge assets and users from established chains like Ethereum, where most liquidity resided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This highlighted that bridging was about more than just asset transfers; it was about improving user experience and abstracting away the complexities of Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Thus, Axelar was designed as a generalized message-passing platform, enabling developers to build robust cross-chain applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Practical Application: General Message Passing (GMP)
Axelar's General Message Passing (GMP) protocol simplifies cross-chain development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. For developers building on a high-throughput [[evm_compatibility_and_innovation | EVM-compatible]] chain like Monad, GMP allows them to deploy the "brain" of their application on Monad while enabling users from other networks (e.g., Arbitrum, Solana) to interact with it seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. This eliminates the need for users to perform separate bridging steps, as asset locking and message passing occur together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. This approach also combats liquidity fragmentation, bringing users to a single ecosystem and simplifying development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Builder and User Perspective
The perspective of builders and users regarding [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] has significantly evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. A year ago, many teams were content building on a single chain, not seeing enough value in cross-chain expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. Today, the conversation has shifted, with teams immediately planning launches on multiple chains and aiming for broader expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. This change is driven by the rapid decentralization of liquidity and users across various chains, making it essential to build for a cross-chain world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>.

## Future Use Cases and Trends in [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | Interoperability]]
While asset transfers remain a primary use case, the [[future_of_the_crypto_industry_and_interoperability | future of interoperability]] is expected to see a cross-chain version of every single-chain application existing today, along with new, unique use cases yet to be imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Cross-chain gas fees are currently a limiting factor, but as [[future_potential_and_scalability_in_the_crypto_space | scaling solutions]] and high-performance chains like Monad reduce costs, cross-chain transactions will become more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

The **[[future_of_the_crypto_industry_and_interoperability | future of interoperability]]** aims to abstract away the underlying blockchain complexities from the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. Users should not need to know if their asset is on Solana and the application on Arbitrum; the wallet should seamlessly handle balances across chains and use [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] infrastructure to pass messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>. This means [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] will become an integral part of virtually every application, including DeFi, gaming, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>.

## Addressing [[challenges_and_strategies_in_building_crypto_infrastructure | Security Risks]]
Axelar implements multiple layers of security to mitigate risks:
1.  **Decentralization:** A fully decentralized validator set eliminates the most common attack vector seen in centralized bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Rate Limiting:** A simple code check that minimizes the impact of a hack by limiting the amount of funds that can be moved within a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>. This can be customized on the Axelar blockchain, allowing damage to be contained even if an external chain breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Multi-solution Approval:** For maximum security, applications can require approval from multiple independent [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] solutions. For example, the Lido community decided to work jointly with both Axelar and Wormhole, requiring approval from both validator sets before an asset is minted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. This creates three layers of security: two independent implementations plus stackable rate limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>.

## Axelar's Interchain Token Service (ITS)
The Interchain Token Service (ITS) is a beta product from Axelar that offers code-free, permissionless tokenization and bridging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. It allows anyone, from meme coin creators to large projects, to launch a token that is cross-chain from day one with robust security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. For instance, Frax, which previously managed its own native bridge, now partners with Axelar to issue Frax assets on chains not supported by Frax Ferry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. This indicates a broader industry trend where projects rely on specialized [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] providers instead of managing cross-chain asset issuance themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. ITS aligns with the ethos of decentralization and permissionlessness, enabling anyone to make their token cross-chain in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>.

## Axelar and Monad Collaboration
Axelar has shown early commitment to supporting Monad, driven by the Monad team's technical expertise, the community's excitement, and demand from builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27:00">[28:27:00]</a>. Axelar aims to be available on Monad from day one, recognizing that for an [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] platform, enabling developers on new chains is crucial for capturing new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>. Monad's [[evm_compatibility_and_innovation | EVM compatibility]] and instant finality are particularly exciting for Axelar, as instant finality is crucial for [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | cross-chain applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. Chains with instant finality, like Monad, significantly improve user experience by reducing message passing times from 15-20 minutes (on Ethereum) to 60-90 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. This speed will foster the growth of more [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | cross-chain applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.

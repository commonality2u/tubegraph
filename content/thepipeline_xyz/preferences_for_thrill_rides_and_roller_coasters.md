When asked to choose a theme park to [[living_in_a_theme_park_for_an_extended_period | live in for a month]]—an [[unusual_vacation_experiences | unusual vacation experience]]—one individual expressed a preference for Six Flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The primary reason cited for this choice is a strong liking for "Thrilla roller coasters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This preference is noted despite it having been a long time since their last visit to such a park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

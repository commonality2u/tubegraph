The Ronin Network, a blockchain company, experienced a significant security breach linked to its popular game, Axi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The parent company, Sky Mavis, was at the center of this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## How the Breach Occurred

The breach began with a phishing attack targeting a Sky Mavis devops engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The engineer received a fake job offer and clicked on an executable file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This single point of failure allowed the attacker to gain access to four keys for a multisignature wallet from the engineer's device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Through [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | social engineering]], the attackers obtained these initial four keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They then performed "lateral movement," shifting from the compromised device to another to acquire a fifth key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. With all five necessary keys in hand, they were able to compromise the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Understanding Multisignature (Multisig)

A multisignature wallet operates like a door requiring multiple keys to unlock it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In the case of the Ronin network, the multisig wallet needed five keys out of a total of nine keyholes to be unlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Impact of the Breach

This incident might be the [[large_scale_cryptocurrency_hack | largest hack in history]] to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. What started as a malicious office email ultimately led to approximately half a billion dollars in exploited funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

His work focuses on creating timely, humorous comics that provide commentary on current events in crypto.

## Bold Leonitis's Artistic Journey

Bold Leonitis began consistently producing daily comics around February 19th, having started sporadically in August 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. He aims to produce at least one new comic every 24 hours, always drawing from scratch rather than reusing previous elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. His initial inspiration for daily creation came from a childhood fondness for newspaper comics, seeking to bring a similar "funnies" element to the often "lifeless" Twitter feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

### The Anti-AI Stance

A key driver for Bold Leonitis's artistic direction was the rise of AI art. He felt that AI was "killing it" and made traditional art seem pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. In response, he deliberately made his art the "antithesis of AI," purposefully leaving in human errors and mistakes to demonstrate its organic creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. His goal was to create timely jokes and visual narratives that AI could not replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>, aiming to prove the human touch in art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

### Early Creations and Influences

Bold Leonitis's very first comic was a drawing of "Did da koku" (Gabriel Leyden), based on his "anon" profile picture, which was later edited to resemble Pepe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. A turning point came with a comic depicting the Vitalik "penis picture" (which was later revealed to be a rolled-up USB cable), which resonated with him and solidified his commitment to the style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

Bold Leonitis views fellow artist Beeple as a "massive inspiration" for his "everyday" art practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. While Beeple aims for one piece a day, Bold Leonitis produces a minimum of one, often several, and has created over 1,500 individual comics in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. He even "speedran" his artistic development by creating around 10 comics a day for a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. Despite complimentary comparisons to Beeple, Bold Leonitis maintains his unique approach, which sometimes leads to eerily similar topical creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Content

Initially, Bold Leonitis's comics were almost entirely focused on the [[NFT market trends and cultural impact | NFT ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. However, as [[NFT market trends and cultural impact | NFTs]] began to lose volume and interest, he consciously decided to pivot towards more general crypto topics, including trading and [[the_growing_popularity_of_meme_coins | meme coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>.

### Tapping into Meme Culture

Bold Leonitis's ability to stay updated and create relevant content stems from being highly "tapped in" to [[influence_and_trends_on_crypto_Twitter | crypto Twitter]] and private groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:42:00">[37:42:00]</a>. A pivotal moment in his understanding of memes came during a Discord event where he created 150 memes in under a day, a "baptism of fire" that immersed him in meme culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.

This experience led him to realize the infinite nature of memes and crypto events, allowing him to endlessly reformat pre-existing memes into his unique style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>. He found that by redrawing classic memes in his own artistic style, he could establish a form of "ownership" and recognition for his work, even if the original meme wasn't his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:00">[28:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. This strategy helps him overcome "writer's block" by providing a reliable source of inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>.

### The Role of Humor and Timeliness

Bold Leonitis's success lies in his ability to offer humorous commentary on current events in crypto culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. He maintains variety in his comic formats, avoiding repetition to keep his audience engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:00">[31:48:00]</a>. He aims for visuals that uniquely suit the comic format, rather than just dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a>.

> "Memes are infinite, this space is infinite in its ideas and in in the scams and stuff that happen every day..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>

His commitment to daily creation and a keen pulse on crypto culture ensures a constant stream of relevant and entertaining content, influencing the way digital art and memes interact within the dynamic crypto environment.

The Monad Madness event featured several teams presenting solutions leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning. These projects span various sectors, from decentralized AI computation to healthcare data management and real-world asset tokenization, demonstrating the wide applicability and growing demand for AI-driven innovations.

## Decentralized AI Protocols

Several teams are focused on addressing the scalability and accessibility challenges of AI through decentralized solutions.

### 42: Planetary AI Scalability
For over a decade, the team at 42 has been working on AI projects, including self-learning [[AI agents in blockchain testing | AI agents]], conversational AI platforms, and training a fundamental model for spatial reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. A persistent challenge they've encountered is the scalability of AI, noting limitations in API requests from centralized providers like OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The industry currently estimates that trillions of dollars are needed to meet AI demand, requiring new nuclear power plants, data centers, and specialized chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

42 proposes a sustainable approach by leveraging compute power already in the hands of users to create a "planetary layer" for AI scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. Their decentralized AI protocol is built on three pillars:
1.  **Small Language Models (SLMs)**: Significant progress in SLMs, such as Qu 2.5, a 7 billion parameter model capable of running on a MacBook Air and surpassing GPT-4 in coding tasks by up to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.
2.  **Excess User Compute**: Modern MacBooks and PCs often utilize only about 20% of their power, especially those with Apple silicon, presenting an untapped resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
3.  **Swarm Inference**: By combining SLMs with user compute, 42 enables a system where individual nodes work together to generate responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. This involves a self-supervised inference where nodes assess their expertise to contribute, peer-review each other's responses, and compile a final answer through a "Knowledge Tree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. This approach aims to lower inference costs by 100x and dramatically improve AI accuracy by avoiding common errors through peer review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

The team behind 42 has a strong AI background, working with Transformer models since their early appearance and developing learning [[AI agents in blockchain testing | AI agents]] based on neural evolution of augmenting topologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. Their CTO holds a PhD in Applied Mathematics with a thesis on distributed agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.

### G: Economic Layer for AI and Compute
G is building the economic layer for AI and compute, aiming to create a new type of yield-bearing asset backed by real AI cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. They identify compute as the "new currency" in the AI era, with GPUs being the asset capturing most value in the AI supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

G tackles the illiquidity and high transaction costs of GPUs by financializing and tokenizing them, then providing liquidity through various DeFi use cases like GPU-backed stablecoins, lending, borrowing options, and futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. Their architecture prioritizes transparency and decentralization, allowing for ongoing monitoring of GPU assets like uptime and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

The yield generated comes from actual demand on the AI cloud services market. One of G's co-founders leads GMI cloud, a company projected to reach $100 million in revenue by year-end through selling AI cloud services to major companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

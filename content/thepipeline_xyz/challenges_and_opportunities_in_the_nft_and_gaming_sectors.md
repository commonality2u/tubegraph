## Overview
The [[The role of NFTs and asset ownership in gaming | NFT]] and [[Crypto gaming and its future potential | gaming]] sectors within crypto present a mix of challenges and opportunities for mainstream adoption and long-term success. While both are seen as potential avenues for bringing more people into the crypto space, they face hurdles related to product utility, sustainability, and public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

## [[role of NFTs in gaming | Challenges in the NFT Sector]]
The [[role of NFTs in gaming | NFT]] bull run brought in many new individuals interested in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>. However, it also led to significant downsides:
*   **Grifting and Short-Term Hype** The period was characterized by "short-term hype" and "mania," with many making money "by accidentally buying a picture of a monkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.
*   **Lack of Bear Market Understanding** Many new participants did not understand what a bear market looks like, leading to misplaced analysis and expectations that most of their [[role of NFTs in gaming | NFT]] assets would recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.
*   **Reputational Damage** The "grifty" nature of the [[role of NFTs in gaming | NFT]] bull run has "extremely put off" powerful mainstream individuals, potentially hindering broader adoption and investment from external industries like music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.

A prediction suggests that the next cycle might see an "[[role of NFTs in gaming | NFT]] grift Bull Run 2.0," potentially even larger than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.

## [[Crypto gaming and its future potential | Challenges in the Gaming Sector]]
While [[Crypto gaming and its future potential | gaming]] is recognized as a major social activity with global appeal, the current state of [[Crypto gaming and its future potential | crypto gaming]] faces significant hurdles:
*   **Focus on Earning, Not Fun** Most [[Crypto gaming and its future potential | crypto games]] seen so far are primarily about "pay to like you're playing this game to make money" rather than being intrinsically fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>. This model is deemed unsustainable long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Game Development** Creating a truly fun game is exceptionally challenging, even for established multi-million and billion-dollar studios like Activision, Bethesda, and Nintendo, which often have a 50/50 hit rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. Crypto-native developers who are new to game development may find it "really hard to build a fun game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.

## [[Challenges and innovations in Web3 gaming | Opportunities and Future Outlook]]
Despite the challenges, both sectors hold potential for growth and positive impact:
*   **Social and Entertainment Avenues** For crypto to appeal to the everyday person and achieve mass adoption, it must integrate with social aspects of life, such as social media and entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. This includes [[Crypto gaming and its future potential | gaming]], as most people play video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.
*   **Traditional Gaming Adoption** The most likely path to successful [[Crypto gaming and its future potential | crypto gaming]] involves traditional [[the_intersection_of_traditional_gaming_companies_and_crypto_adoption | gaming companies]] recognizing the value in blockchain technology and integrating it into their existing, fun-first games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.
*   **Utility in NFTs** While not bullish on [[role of NFTs in gaming | music NFTs]] as the primary disruptive force, some [[role of NFTs in gaming | NFT]] use cases like Rolling Loud's "Loud Punks" (providing VIP access to festivals forever) show genuine utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.
*   **Disruption in Music Industry** Crypto has the potential to significantly disrupt the music industry, particularly by creating protocols that ensure artists are paid "quickly" and "efficiently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. Currently, about 70% of money in music does not reach the artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

The overall goal for the industry is to "keep getting better" and avoid past mistakes, particularly those related to "grifting" that alienate potential adopters and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>. The long-term vision is for crypto to find its place in the world in a way that truly "benefits people in Mass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

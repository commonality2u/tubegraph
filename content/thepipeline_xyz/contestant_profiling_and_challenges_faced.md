### Dalgona Cookie Challenge
Inspired by *Squid Games*, contestants had 7 minutes to carve out a design from a cookie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. All contestants chose the "hard" route, which was worth 1,000 mana tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Breaking the cookie resulted in immediate loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Participants experienced sweaty hands and struggled with the delicate task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Strategies included melting the back of the cookie to make it super thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Several contestants broke their cookies, leading to elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Influencer Ranking & [[psychic_challenge_insights | Psychic Challenge Insights]]
Contestants were first asked to rank themselves from most to least influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Afterward, a professional psychic conducted a 5-minute reading with each contestant to independently rank them by influence based on her intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. If the psychic placed someone in the same spot they put themselves, they won 500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. If she placed them in the number one spot, they won 1,000 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Each contestant then had 15 seconds to argue why they were the most influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

The psychic's readings included observations such as:
*   Being a "great organizer, a little anal," and an "empath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   Having a desire to "act, to perform," and liking the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   Being a "caregiver" and "secretive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   Preferring to be "in the back" but enjoying "fantasies" and wanting to be "bigger than life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   Being "very gentle, very caring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a> and having an "emptiness" when home alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   One participant noted the psychic correctly identified their preference not to be in the spotlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

### "Hot or Not" [[pitch_competition_dynamics | Pitch Competition Dynamics]]
This challenge required contestants to pick a random prompt for a non-existent startup and pitch it in 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. The pitches were rated by the other contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. To earn more mana, participants could choose to eat increasingly spicy items: jelly beans (200 mana), the world's hottest chocolate (500 mana), or the one chip challenge (2,000 mana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Drinking yogurt before time was up forfeited points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Ice Block Seed Phrase Challenge
Contestants selected tools to break open a block of ice containing eight words of a seed phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. They had 10 minutes to retrieve the words and order them correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Tools ranged from versatile options to a keyboard and a spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The challenge involved breaking the ice, often leading to words mixing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. One contestant resorted to bribing another for a missing word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

### Split or Steal
The final and most significant challenge, worth 2,500 tokens, was a psychological game called "Split or Steal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Each contestant secretly wrote "split" or "steal" on a card. The rules for token distribution were:
*   **Everybody Splits:** Each person gets 500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   **Only One Steals:** The one who steals takes all tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
*   **Two or More Steal:** Splitters get everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
*   **Three or More Steal:** No one wins anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

This [[high_stakes_gambling_competition_dynamics | high stakes gambling competition dynamics]] created tension and involved a game of "trust, strategy, and maybe a little backstabbing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. Ultimately, Professor Pipelines, also known as Danny, was the sole stealer and won the entire 2,500 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. Despite winning $5,000 to give to the community, he made an unexpected decision to split the prize among three other "OG Monad community members" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

During a conversation about [[unusual_vacation_experiences | unusual vacation experiences]], a person from India, identified as Pin, shared a unique location they had visited within their home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## A Mysterious Coastal Cave

The strangest place Pin had ever visited was a cave located on a beach in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This cave was distinct because it was described as being half underwater and half above water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. A notable characteristic of this location was that while one could enter the cave during the day, it was impossible to exit during the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

When asked which theme park they would choose to live in for a month, one individual selected Six Flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The reason for this choice was a long-standing absence from the park and an enjoyment of "Thrilla roller coasters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

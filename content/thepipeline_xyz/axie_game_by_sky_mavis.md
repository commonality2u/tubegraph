## Overview of Axie and Sky Mavis

Axie is a popular game developed by Sky Mavis, which is believed to be the parent company of the blockchain company Ronin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The game operates on the Ronin blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Ronin Bridge Hack

The Ronin blockchain, which hosts Axie, experienced a significant security breach. An engineer was compromised after being "fished" with a job offer, leading them to click an executable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Exploitation of Multi-Signature System
A critical point of failure was that the compromised device of one Sky Mavis employee gained access to four keys of a multi-signature system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A multi-signature (multi-sig) is a system that requires multiple keys to unlock, similar to a door needing many keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. In this case, five out of nine keys were required to unlock it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Through social engineering, the attackers obtained four of these keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They then performed "lateral movement," shifting from the initially compromised device to another to acquire an additional key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This gave them all five necessary keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Aftermath
The breach, stemming from a seemingly innocuous office email, resulted in damages of approximately half a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It is considered potentially the largest hack in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

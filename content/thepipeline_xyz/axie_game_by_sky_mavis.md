## Overview

Axie is a popular [[onchain gaming | game]] that was developed by Sky Mavis, the parent company of the blockchain company Ronin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Ronin Bridge Hack

Sky Mavis, the company behind Axie, experienced a significant security breach that may still be the largest hack in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The incident stemmed from a phishing attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

The attack unfolded as follows:
*   **Initial Compromise** A devops engineer at Sky Mavis was "fished" through a job offer, reportedly clicking an executable file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This created a single point of failure where the individual's device gained access to four keys for a multi-signature (multi-sig) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Multi-Sig Mechanics**
    > A multi-sig is essentially "a door with like many keys to unlock it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In this specific case, it required five keys out of nine possible keyholes to unlock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Key Acquisition** Through social engineering, the attackers managed to obtain four of the necessary keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They then performed "lateral movement," moving from the initially compromised device to another to acquire a fifth key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Total Compromise** With all five keys in their possession, the attackers were able to compromise the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The email-led attack resulted in significant damage, estimated at about half a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

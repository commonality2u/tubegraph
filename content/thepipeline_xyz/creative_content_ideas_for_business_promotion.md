Businesses often seek to create content to promote their services or products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While traditional methods might focus on direct self-promotion, a more effective strategy involves providing value to the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Moving Beyond Self-Promotion

Traditional promotional content often centers on the business itself, detailing aspects like organically sourced materials or high-quality ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach can be perceived as self-focused ("me me me") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Instead, businesses should aim to create content that offers value to the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

This means positioning content in a way that prioritizes the [[audiencefirst_approach_in_business_marketing | audience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Creating valuable content establishes a different dynamic with the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Example: The Sandwich Shop

Consider a sandwich shop looking to promote its business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rather than a commercial touting organic vegetables and high-quality meats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, they could create a content series about the best places to go on a picnic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

In this series, the sandwich could be simply brought along and featured as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The content would focus on providing information about picnic spots, whether through an informative or entertaining lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This approach subtly [[showcasing_products_subtly_in_content | showcases]] the product while primarily giving value to the audience by offering useful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The business can still mention desired details about their sandwiches, but the overall content is centered on the audience's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

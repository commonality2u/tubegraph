An unconventional belief suggests that children who have experienced some level of trauma may be funnier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">00:00:05</a>. This is clarified not as deep trauma, but a "little" trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">00:00:10</a>. The reasoning behind this is the idea that if a child experiences only positive things and everyone is always nice to them, they might not develop a sense of [[the_impact_of_childhood_experiences_on_humor | humor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">00:00:14</a>.

## The Role of Challenges in Development

Beyond just humor, there's a broader perspective that life cannot "just all be rainbows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">00:00:42</a>. It's argued that "suffering leads to growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">00:00:46</a>, and contributes to developing [[the_importance_of_resilience_and_grit_in_development | grit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">00:00:50</a>. This suggests that a degree of exposure to difficulties or challenges is beneficial for a child's overall development.

## Perceived Controversy

The unconventional nature of this belief is acknowledged, with concern about potential backlash or being "cancelled" if such a statement were widely publicized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">00:00:23</a>.

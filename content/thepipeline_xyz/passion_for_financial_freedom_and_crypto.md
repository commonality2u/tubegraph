A core passion for the speaker is [[self_sovereignty_and_financial_control_through_crypto | financial freedom]] and financial rights, viewing them as fundamental to nearly every other human right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This belief system is what drew them into the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The speaker believes that if individuals control their finances, they can allocate their money towards what they genuinely care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This is contrasted with a situation where people are controlled by the government that "owns the money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This perspective highlights the potential of [[crypto_opportunities_in_personal_finance_and_decentralized_finance | crypto opportunities in personal finance and decentralized finance]] to empower individuals.

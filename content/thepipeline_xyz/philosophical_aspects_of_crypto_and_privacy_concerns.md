## The Original Ethos of Crypto
The foundational idea of crypto, according to some, was built on the belief in [[self_sovereignty_and_financial_control_through_crypto | self-sovereign ownership]] over assets and the importance of financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Initially, there was a "whimsical idea of self-sovereignty" that drew people to the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. This core ethos advocated for the elimination of middlemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

## Concerns Regarding Centralization and Surveillance
Despite the original vision, discussions around the Bitcoin ETF and figures like Larry Fink introduce new complexities. Larry Fink has expressed bullish views on blockchain technology, noting its potential to eliminate corruption by allowing tokenized assets and identities on a public ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

However, a contrasting view highlights the potential downsides of such transparency:
> "I also sort of question how bullish is it that he's basically wants to tokenize everything in order to not allow you any sort of Financial Freedom whatsoever you he's basically going to know every transaction you ever make and then where does it go from there you know if you say the wrong thing or you you you follow the wrong political agenda Etc what what kind of limitations can they put on your finances and stuff so is it bullish on the sense that like we might be able to print more money in the sense that money is going to flood in and we make profit yes but how bullish is it actually from a fre Freedom perspective because I don't think it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>

This perspective suggests that a public blockchain could also be used for surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, potentially leading to a loss of financial freedom and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. The concern is that organizations like BlackRock are not philanthropic and might monopolize personal freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### The Shift in Priorities
Some argue that the crypto community's priorities have shifted from philosophical ideals to profit maximization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. While financial independence can be a form of [[self_sovereignty_and_financial_control_through_crypto | self-sovereignty]], it may come "at the cost of what the idea of crypto was in the first place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. This leads to a "two-edged sword" scenario where financial gain might compromise independence and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

## Seeking Privacy Solutions in the Blockchain Ecosystem
Despite [[security_concerns_and_solutions_in_blockchain_ecosystems | security concerns and solutions in blockchain ecosystems]], innovation is working to engineer privacy into crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. The argument is that privacy is a normal human expectation, similar to having a shower curtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Projects are actively working on solving these [[crypto_security_challenges | crypto security challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>, though they may not be as vocal on social media as traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

Some examples of areas focusing on privacy solutions include:
*   Native privacy on Solana, with teams like Elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   Projects like Nilon working on MPC (Multi-Party Computation) innovation to handle large amounts of data privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   [[future_applications_and_scalability_in_the_crypto_space | Cosmos]] and the rollup area, specifically using IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) to build fraud proofs natively, offering a potentially better design than current Ethereum rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>. Celestia, Dimension, and Sovereign Labs are mentioned as strong teams in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

## The Broader Impact of Technology and the Pendulum Effect
The discussion extends beyond just crypto to the broader impact of technology on human experience. A concern is raised about the progression of technology leading to a "detriment of like human experience" and a lack of actual human engagement and connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

The idea of the "boil the frog" analogy is used to describe the slow encroachment of technology on privacy and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. There's a fear of moving towards a "dystopian" future where society becomes "identityless" and sterile, losing its personality and filling voids with consumerism and short-attention-span content like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

However, an optimistic view suggests a "pendulum" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. While currently swinging towards an online, less personal side, it is believed it will eventually "come back down towards the middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

### The Need for User-Friendly Blockchain Applications
For crypto to achieve mainstream adoption and address privacy concerns effectively, there's a strong emphasis on building applications that are so seamless users don't even realize blockchain is working in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. This approach prioritizes user experience and ease of use over requiring deep technical understanding from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

> "I'm really bullish on on apps that are are blockchain based that are benefiting the user because of its its use cases but you don't have to be some kind of like super blockchain native human to use it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>

The focus should be on building consumer-driven, social applications that are simple to use and onboard, aligning with existing user habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. An example given is Parcel, which allows people to bet on housing markets without needing crypto knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. This approach can bring [[realworld_problems_solved_by_crypto | real-world problems solved by crypto]] to a wider audience, facilitating a gradual understanding of the underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to build technology that enhances real-life meetups and human connection, bringing the "human side back" to the digital realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

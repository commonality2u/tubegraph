One of the largest hacks in history involved the Ronin [[Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology | blockchain]] company, the parent company of which was Sky Mavis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This company was behind the popular game, Axie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Compromise

The incident began when a Devops Engineer from Sky Mavis was [[common_cryptocurrency_scams | fished]] through a deceptive job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The engineer clicked on an executable file received as part of this offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Exploiting Multisignature Security

A critical point of failure was that this single compromised device gained access to four keys for a [[multisignature_security_breach | multi-signature]] (multisig) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A multisig system acts like a door requiring multiple keys to unlock it, in this case, five out of nine total keyholes were needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Through [[common_attack_vectors_in_crypto | social engineering]], the attackers were able to acquire four of the necessary keys from the initial compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They then executed lateral movement, shifting from the compromised device to another, to obtain the fifth key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Outcome

With all five keys in their possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, the attackers were able to compromise the system. This hack resulted in an estimated loss of approximately half a billion dollars, making it potentially the largest hack in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The incident highlights how a seemingly simple phishing email can lead to catastrophic financial damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

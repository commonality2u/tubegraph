Logan, Managing Partner at Frictionless Capital, joined the podcast to discuss his background, the thesis behind Frictionless Capital, and the future of [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput blockchains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Logan's Background and Entry into Crypto
Logan began his career in Silicon Valley, working at Tesla where he spearheaded the supercharging network on the software side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. While at Tesla, he maintained a keen interest in the crypto sphere, having personally become involved with Ethereum in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. His enthusiasm for Ethereum waned when he experienced high gas fees ($1,000) during the 2021 bull market, leading him to explore alternative ecosystems focused on [[blockchain_scalability_and_highperformance_systems | scaling]] the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. He became excited about new infrastructure, including Monad, that could onboard the majority of the world due to low transaction fees, [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput]], and unique applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Frictionless Capital's Thesis
Frictionless Capital was founded to focus on new infrastructures, specifically [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput blockchains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Their thesis, established in early 2023, was considered "deeply unpopular" at the time, especially when Solana was widely perceived as "dead" after the FTX implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Despite the contrarian view, Frictionless Capital believed Solana represented a unique category of [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput blockchains]], being the first to employ technology architectures like large data propagation, big blocks, and [[Parallel Execution in Blockchain | parallel processing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

The core goal of Frictionless Capital is to enable self-sovereignty, private keys, and blockchain functionality for as many people as possible globally, moving from millions of users to ultimately hundreds of millions and billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. They believe that [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput blockchains]] are directionally correct for achieving this mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Importance of Scaling and First Principles Thinking
Logan's conviction stems from a "first principles" approach, which involves dissecting arguments and identifying flaws in thinking to reach the root cause of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. He learned this methodology at Tesla, where products like the Cybertruck were architected by challenging industry assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

After departing Tesla, Logan spent a year and a half conducting independent research into blockchain architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. He realized that "block space"—the amount of transactions a network can propagate—is the limiting factor, analogous to the transition from 56k modems to broadband and fiber optics internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Users and developers will always choose faster, cheaper transactions that allow for more interesting applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Therefore, blockchains that leverage modern computing and networking practices are likely to onboard the vast majority of users and engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

Solana was the first to take this unique approach by [[blockchain_scalability_and_highperformance_systems | scaling]] with hardware and increasing bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Other new architectures like Monad, Sui, and Aptos are following suit, integrating features like [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput]] and [[Parallel Execution in Blockchain | parallel processing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Identifying Promising Projects
Frictionless Capital looks for unique, crypto-native applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. They prioritize discussions with technical co-founders, who are typically honest about engineering tradeoffs, rather than marketing personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. For Logan, tech is a starting point to build unique products that will grow the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. He values feedback that highlights flaws or gaps in his own logic, as it aids learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

Their due diligence process involves extensive homework, especially in [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput blockchains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. When a team like Monad announces they will [[Parallel Execution in Blockchain | parallelize the EVM]] and make it [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput]], it becomes "pretty obvious" given the team's caliber, that they will deliver something special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

## New Architectures and Monad's Role
Modern [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput blockchains]] generally feature integrated designs and [[Parallel Execution in Blockchain | parallel processing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The transition from low-throughput to [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput blockchains]] enables many unique applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. For example, automated market makers (AMMs) were a solution created due to limitations of earlier blockchain architectures; with [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput]], order books become feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Monad is described as a combination of Solana's performance and Ethereum's EVM compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. Logan believes if he could rewrite Ethereum's history, he would design its architecture like Monad's, incorporating [[Parallel Execution in Blockchain | parallel processing]] and [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. He criticizes the single-threaded EVM for its inability to do [[Parallel Execution in Blockchain | parallel processing]], which he sees as a fundamental requirement for the industry's future [[blockchain_scalability_and_highperformance_systems | scaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

While acknowledging the significant infrastructure and capital built on the EVM, Logan stresses that a more integrated technology stack, like that of Monad, simplifies the experience for both users and engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. This allows engineers to focus on product development rather than infrastructure, which is crucial for moving the industry forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

## Future Applications Enabled by High Throughput Blockchains
Logan is excited for the "Golden Era of crypto products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Applications uniquely enabled by [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput]] include:
*   **DeFi 2.0**: Leveraging native order books and high-throughput capabilities for financial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. This will integrate traditional finance (TradFi) technology stacks to facilitate global money movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs)**: These networks offer a new way for capital formation and have the potential to enable applications with 10 million monthly active wallets on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. Examples like Helium expanding into cell phone plans show how physical world services can use crypto rails in the backend without users needing to know it's on a blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **Social Applications**: Continued experiments on [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput blockchains]] are expected to lead to more widespread adoption in social platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.

The key is to build foundational infrastructure that allows for unique applications "only possible" on a [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput blockchain]] architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. This new design space, enabled by [[high_performance_blockchains | high throughput blockchains]], is seen as the key to unlocking viral applications and ushering in the consumer age of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.

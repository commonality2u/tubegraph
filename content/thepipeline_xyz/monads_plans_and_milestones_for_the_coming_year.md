Monad is currently focused on a clear roadmap for the coming year, building on the recent launch of its Devnet. The primary objective is to move towards a robust mainnet launch, supported by continued development, team expansion, and deeper community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>.

## Upcoming Milestones

The recently announced [[monads_devnet_launch_and_its_significance | Devnet]] serves as the initial step in Monad's strategic rollout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. It functions as an internal core team environment for "dogfooding" the blockchain, identifying strengths, and areas for further optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

The next significant milestone on the horizon is the **Testnet** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This will be a phased release, allowing for broader participation and the sharing of more insights as development progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The ultimate goal remains the launch of a "really strong main net" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>.

## Team and Ecosystem Growth

Monad plans to continue building out its team across all areas, with a significant focus on engineering, as well as strengthening the ecosystem side to support the expanding community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. This expansion reflects the [[monads_evolution_from_a_small_startup_to_a_larger_team | company's growth]] from a small startup to a larger, more structured organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

The project views the Monad blockchain as a "skeleton," while the ecosystem of applications, tooling, and infrastructure are the "muscles and tendons" that bring it to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>. This emphasizes the critical role of external developers and the broader crypto community in realizing Monad's full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.

## Community and Engagement

A key aspect of the year ahead involves increasing Monad's physical presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Attending various conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.
*   Potentially hosting their own events in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.
*   Discussions around hosting a hackathon, though this might be further down the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.

The team also plans to release new merchandise and designs in the coming months, with opportunities for community members to acquire Monad swag at conferences or through future updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>. The community's ongoing creativity, seen in artwork, nails, and music, is highlighted as a source of excitement and a key driver of the Monad culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.

The mission is to continue to build out the team and to be a "continued presence" within the crypto industry, allowing them to share more about Monad's capabilities with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>.

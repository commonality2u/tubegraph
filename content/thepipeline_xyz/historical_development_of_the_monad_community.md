The [[growth_and_development_of_the_monad_community | Monad community]] began as a relatively small and infrequent gathering of like-minded individuals, evolving significantly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:59">[02:09:59]</a>.

## Early Days
Approximately a year prior to the recording, individuals first joined the [[history_of_the_monad_community | Monad Discord]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. Even from its inception, the community displayed "infectious" vibes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>. The early days were described as having a similar core mission and values, but with significantly less frequent content compared to later stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Content that might now be produced hourly used to be a weekly occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

The community building efforts started during the "deep bear" market, at a time when there was little exciting activity in the crypto space outside of Telegram bots and hamster racing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>. This timing was seen as a "massive advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>.

## Key Platforms and Their Evolution

### Discord
Initially, the [[growth_and_development_of_the_monad_community | Monad Discord]] began as an "invite only" space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. The opening of this invite-only Discord to a public one marked [[roles_and_tasks_within_the_monad_community | Intern Bra]]'s first involvement with the [[history_of_the_monad_community | Monad community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

### Telegram
The [[growth_and_development_of_the_monad_community | Monad Telegram]] chat was launched in December 2022 as a fully public channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:08">[02:37:08]</a>. Around April 2023, the chat transitioned to a "locked" or private status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This change sparked meme competitions and more active engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. The Telegram chat has since accumulated over 2 million messages, primarily consisting of stickers and links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

The idea for the Telegram chat, capped at 1,000 members, was a natural evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Initially, there was no cap, but as it grew, the community decided to implement one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This led to the implementation of "purges" and "missions" to manage membership, creating a formal system for removals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The Telegram chat has seen over 47 purges, with a core group of members who have survived them all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### Twitter
Twitter plays a significant role in content volume and outreach for the [[growth_and_development_of_the_monad_community | Monad community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## Notable Events and Milestones
*   **First Meme Competition**: Danny winning the first meme competition in the Telegram channel was a significant early event, leading to his increased involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **"Up Only Shout Out in August"**: This event was a major catalyst for the community's growth, drawing many new members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:05">[02:04:05]</a>.
*   **The Purge**: The system of "purges" and "missions" in the Telegram chat developed as a way to manage its capped membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. ID Kravitz played a key role in providing data for these purges, allowing for detailed tracking of member activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

Omar is a member of the [[roles_and_tasks_at_monad | ecosystem team]] at Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Focus Areas and Responsibilities

The [[roles_and_tasks_at_monad | ecosystem team]] is involved in various aspects of the Monad environment, contributing to its growth and development.

### Community Engagement
The team's involvement extends to the Monad community, exemplified by the humorous suggestion to "purge" John W Rich from the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:20]</a>. This highlights a degree of engagement with the project's [[community_engagement_in_crypto_projects | community]].

### Fostering Innovation
The team views Monad as a "super fast place" for users to "make things cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:34]</a>, indicating a focus on facilitating creation and innovation within the [[monad_ecosystem_developments | Monad ecosystem]].

### Exploring Future Applications
A key area of interest for the [[roles_and_tasks_at_monad | ecosystem team]] involves exploring future applications and [[opportunities_in_the_manad_ecosystem | opportunities in the Monad ecosystem]]. An ideal "dream app" would allow for the tokenization of "everything at a very niche level," such as a daily jog or personal bets with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:49]</a>. This reflects a belief that the "future is just tokenization of everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:57]</a>, suggesting the team supports broad and granular tokenization initiatives.

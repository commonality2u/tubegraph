Verifying wallet addresses is crucial in cryptocurrency transactions to [[preventing_loss_in_crypto_transactions | prevent loss]] due to malicious activities like address poisoning attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Address Poisoning Attacks

Address poisoning attacks are a specific type of scam where attackers attempt to trick users into sending crypto to a malicious address that visually resembles a legitimate one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### How Address Poisoning Works

Attackers monitor transactions on platforms like EtherScan or other transaction ledgers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Upon detecting an incoming transaction to a user, they immediately send a transaction to that user's wallet with an address that looks very similar to one the user might regularly interact with (e.g., their own second wallet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The similarity is achieved by making the first and last characters of the malicious address very close to the legitimate one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. In a browser view, the middle characters of the address may not be visible, making it difficult for users to spot the discrepancy at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

For example:
> If your address starts with `0x11` and ends in `563FD`, an attacker's address might also start with `0x11` and end in `563FD`, making the full address appear identical in a truncated view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Risks and Consequences

If a user is not paying close attention, they might mistakenly copy the malicious address from their transaction history, believing it to be a legitimate wallet they intend to send funds to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This often happens when users are sending crypto between their own wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The accidental transfer of a large amount of money to the wrong address has resulted in significant financial losses for many individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Prevention and Best Practices

To [[preventing_loss_in_crypto_transactions | prevent loss]] from address poisoning and ensure secure transactions, users should always adhere to the following best practices:

*   **Use the Direct Source:** Always obtain the wallet address from the direct source, such as your own wallet interface or a verified contact, rather than copying from transaction history, especially after receiving an unexpected incoming transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Verify the Entire Address:** Before sending any cryptocurrency, thoroughly verify that the exact address you intend to send to matches the one you have entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This includes checking not just the first and last characters but the entire string.

> [!WARNING]
> People have lost tons of money from accidentally sending to the wrong address due to address poisoning. Always be aware and verify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

For [[early_stage_founders_and_leadership | early stage founders]], the notion of immediate leadership can be [[counterintuitive_nature_of_leadership_development | counterintuitive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Initially, the focus isn't on leadership in the traditional sense, but on intensive, hands-on involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The "Soldier" Phase of Leadership

The fundamental [[role_of_founders_in_startups | job of a founder]] is to perform virtually every task required for the venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The greatest founders who ultimately become leaders first excelled as "great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This hands-on experience includes:
*   Writing code themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Handling sales personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Even minor tasks like cleaning their own workspaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Managing legal and accounting matters directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

Essentially, founders must initially take on every responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

> Be an exceptional "soldier" yourself. Engage in numerous on-the-ground battles before considering hiring additional team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## The Value of Ground-Level Experience

Performing these foundational tasks provides critical insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This deep understanding of operational challenges is invaluable for knowing how to recruit effective team members later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Following this intense hands-on phase, there will be a [[transition_from_soldier_to_leader | transition period]] where the founder grows into a leadership role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While support often exists for those becoming leaders, there is less emphasis on developing individuals into highly capable "soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Ultimately, a truly effective leader often emerges from being a strong "warrior" who has fought battles on the front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. A leader who lacks direct, on-the-ground experience in the battles faced by their team may not be as effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

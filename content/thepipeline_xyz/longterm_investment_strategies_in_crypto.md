Developing a long-term investment strategy in crypto involves understanding market cycles, distinguishing valuable projects from speculative assets, and maintaining a robust personal financial philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

## Memecoins vs. Fundamental Value
The crypto market has seen many cycles play out, leading to experienced participants holding a generally bearish view on memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Memecoins are particularly popular with newer crypto users, often those who joined in the last one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:58">[01:48:58]</a>.

While some memecoins like Doge, Bonk, or Whiff can emerge to create real culture, they are exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>. The vast majority of memecoins (99.9%) are considered "absolute trash," often created by a small number of people and functioning as pump-and-dump schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. These assets are generally useless, and those with large followings may use them to create liquidity for themselves, leading to a "YOLO cycle" or "financial nihilism" among investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.

The idea that memecoins are a rebellion against "insider" or "VC coins" is a misconception, as there are often insiders who hold a significant portion of the supply (e.g., 40%) and are waiting to dump on retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:19">[02:17:19]</a>. This low liquidity situation means that when large holders decide to sell, the market can crash rapidly, leaving late investors holding the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:28">[02:29:28]</a>.

Instead of chasing someone else's victory in speculative assets, focus should be on building or investing in "something real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. This includes [[Future applications and scalability in the crypto space | infrastructure plays]], financial derivatives, and bringing real-world goods on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Projects like Solana, despite facing severe market downturns and perceived backer issues (e.g., FTX), emerged due to the grit of its founder, Anatoly, and a strong developer community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:33">[02:37:33]</a>.

### The "Skinny Door" Analogy
Su Zhu's "fat people, skinny door" analogy describes the crypto market's liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:32">[02:16:32]</a>. The "skinny door" represents very low liquidity, making it challenging for many to exit, while "fat people" are the large supply holders willing to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>. This dynamic contributes to the severe corrections seen in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## Challenges for Founders and Builders
Founders building in crypto face significant challenges, especially during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

*   **Market Appetite:** The market appetite for certain narratives (e.g., NFTs) can change rapidly, requiring startups to be lean and adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:10">[03:17:10]</a>.
*   **Funding:** Founders should aim to raise as much money as possible at a higher valuation in a bull market to sustain operations through a bear market, rather than taking a "lean" approach early on and risking a down round later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. A typical funding window provides 12 to 24 months of runway, but long-term sustainability often requires a 10-year plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Dev Fatigue:** The ease with which memecoins can generate millions of dollars in weeks can lead to "dev fatigue" among talented individuals working on "real products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **Narrative vs. Utility:** While narratives can be powerful, they can also be extraordinarily disheartening for legitimate builders when speculative assets gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Projects need to find product-market fit beyond mere speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **User Experience (UX):** For crypto products to gain mass adoption, the crypto element must be completely invisible to the end-user, providing a seamless experience akin to traditional web services or mobile apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

### The Vision for Real-World Assets (RWAs)
A long-term vision involves bringing real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain using NFTs as a form of title or deed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This could revolutionize industries by creating transparent, verifiable historical records of ownership, maintenance, and metadata for physical assets like construction equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Currently, the "app layer" of crypto is failing to achieve this, with most efforts remaining insulated within the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

> "People who are building products using crypto, using blockchains and using using the technology and the infrastructure provided by crypto for a real world industry like we're just not doing that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

Future builders should identify industries that need disruption and use crypto as a tool, rather than focusing solely on the crypto industry itself, which is primarily suited for infrastructure development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Personal Investment Philosophy
Long-term success in crypto, like in other forms of [[Investment strategies and evaluating crypto projects | investment strategies]], requires a strong personal financial philosophy and self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

*   **Define Your Endgame:** Identify clear financial and quality-of-life goals. Don't let the pursuit of wealth consume your identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **Manage Expectations:** Be aware of the "house money" fallacy, where mentally, your net worth becomes the highest number you've seen, even if it's vaporous liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. This can lead to disappointment and unrealistic expectations.
*   **Take Profits:** Always be willing to "take some off the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. If you've achieved significant gains, like turning a small investment into millions, secure those profits.
    > "You will not regret not holding for 20 like forget that you have a Long window you're probably like 24 years old too by the way you can make 7% a year and double your money every 10 years like dominate just like just not don't dominate just get average returns and now your $6 million is $12 million 10 years from now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Comparison:** Recognize that "someone is always richer than you and somebody is always better at this than you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Focusing on external validation or being "the richest guy in the room" is a dangerous path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Balance Life:** Maintain balance between your crypto activities and other aspects of your life, such as family, hobbies (e.g., CrossFit, baseball), and personal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Over-focusing on crypto can lead to neglecting healthy routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluate Conviction:** The core narratives and reasons for getting into crypto may become weaker over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. It's important to re-evaluate your [[Conviction in crypto investing | conviction]] and adjust your investment allocation as goals and market conditions change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

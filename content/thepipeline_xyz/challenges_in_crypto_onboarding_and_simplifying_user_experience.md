The crypto industry faces significant [[Challenges in Onboarding New Crypto Users | challenges in onboarding new users]] and improving the overall [[User Experience and Retention in Crypto | user experience]]. Many existing crypto applications are perceived as clunky, threatening, and not intuitive, leading to low long-term retention rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.

## Current State of Crypto User Experience

Traditional centralized exchanges offer a more efficient experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:01">[03:38:01]</a>, while decentralized applications (dApps) often suffer from significant friction. Setting up a new wallet, understanding seed phrases, funding wallets, and navigating between different chains or protocols can be overwhelming for new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:39">[03:38:39]</a>. This complexity leads to poor adoption rates and wasted advertising spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>.

User surveys indicate that 98% of liquidity in Automated Market Makers (AMMs) sits idle, highlighting capital inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>. Furthermore, many decentralized exchange (DEX) models, particularly orderbook models, often rely on off-chain matching engines, which introduces a lack of transparency and risk of front-running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>.

## Key Challenges Highlighted

*   **Complexity and Friction:** Users encounter numerous steps, applications, and technical terms (e.g., gas, L2s, token addresses, seed phrases) just to complete simple tasks like a trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:08">[03:53:08]</a>. One example showed 73 clicks for a single Perpetual trade, taking over 6 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:14">[03:54:14]</a>. This high friction makes it difficult for "normal users" to enter the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>.
*   **Lack of Trust and Verifiability:** Past incidents, such as the Orthogonal Trading scam where $36 million was lost due to falsified financial statements, underscore the need for verifiable means to monitor and ensure counterparty integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This lack of trust has caused lenders to abandon uncollateralized lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Fragmentation:** The proliferation of new chains and protocols has led to scattered and insufficient liquidity, resulting in bad slippage and poor user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:28">[03:54:28]</a>.
*   **Security Concerns:** Automated solutions often come with security trade-offs, making users hesitant to commit significant portions of their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:08">[03:39:08]</a>.
*   **Limited Appeal to Mainstream:** Consumer crypto products are described as "threatening, hideous, and definitely not it girl," failing to meet users where they are without forcing "hyperfinancializing alien habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.

## Strategies for Simplification and Improved User Experience

Several projects are focused on abstracting away the underlying blockchain complexity and improving [[User Experience and Retention in Crypto | user retention]] through intuitive design and gamification:

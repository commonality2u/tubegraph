Consumer crypto products are a rapidly emerging category, gaining significant attention for their innovative approach to integrating blockchain technology with everyday user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These products often combine software and hardware components, building on verticals that have already seen substantial traction in traditional markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Pulse: A Lifestyle Wearable in Crypto

Pulse is highlighted as a cutting-edge example of a consumer-facing product, specifically a "lifestyle wearable" rather than just a health wearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Its vision is centered on the belief that physical well-being can enhance productivity, whether at work, in social life, or personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The device is designed to provide data to help users become better operators, builders, and humans in the ways they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Philosophy and Product Differentiation
The founder's personal experience of prioritizing work over health led to the realization that the body, unlike crypto assets, cannot be traded or easily replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This inspired Pulse's focus on graceful aging and maximizing productivity through health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Pulse differentiates itself from traditional wearables like Whoop, Oura, and Apple Watch by focusing on broader "lifestyle" aspects beyond just health and fitness metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. While products like Whoop are often used by those in tech to track sleep, their primary design is for athletes optimizing strain and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Pulse, however, aims to optimize for "productivity" by considering factors such as sleep, exercise, diet, stress levels, sun exposure, socializing, and overall fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Hardware Challenges and Strategic Advantages
Developing hardware is significantly more complex than software, likened to "chewing glass that is on fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Mistakes in hardware can lead to costly and time-consuming rebuilds, unlike quick software updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The process involves extensive work in production, finding and benchmarking suppliers, designing, logistics, fulfillment, and branding, all of which cannot be shortcutted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Pulse's co-founder even relocated to China for an extended period to oversee production until the final wearable leaves the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Despite the difficulties, building hardware offers several strategic advantages:
*   **Creating a Moat** Prevents displacement by other teams, such as existing wearable companies restricting API access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Direct Crypto Integration** The wearable includes an NFC chip, allowing direct integration with a crypto wallet for "proof of pulse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This enables verification of "one wallet equals one human" without doxing users, valuable for other teams needing human verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure for Developers** Pulse views its wearable as infrastructure, providing an API and SDK for other teams to build software on top of their device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Data Collection and Auto-Detection
Pulse uses multiple sensors on the wrist to infer daily activities:
*   **Accelerometer** Detects acceleration, deceleration, and movement (lifting, putting down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
*   **Temperature Sensors** Indicate if a user is outdoors or indoors, or in specific environments like hot yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
*   **Heart Rate Sensors** Help identify consistent heart rate patterns associated with activities like running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

These biometric data points allow Pulse to automatically detect around 50 common fitness and health activities such as swimming, running, boxing, lifting weights, and yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. The device also aims to track general lifestyle data, like prolonged sitting or phone usage, and nudge users towards more energetic or productive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

## Web3 and the User-Owned Data Model

The core advantage of consumer crypto products like Pulse lies in their web3 component, particularly regarding data ownership and incentives. Traditional wearables often sell user data to third parties without rewarding the users who generated it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Pulse aims to change this by using [[future_potential_use_cases_for_crypto_and_blockchain | crypto rails]] as a transparency mechanism for data brokerage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Incentivized Data Sharing
Users are notified if a third party, such as a university for a clinical study, wishes to acquire their data. They can then review the opportunity and decide whether to license their data, potentially for a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This creates a transparent relationship where users are rewarded for the value they generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This "live to earn" model rewards users for sharing their day-to-day life data, not necessarily for being healthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. The goal is to build a comprehensive "Health digital twin" by eventually incentivizing users to contribute blood work, DNA, and electronic health records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

### Data Security and Privacy
A key differentiator is the commitment to data security. Pulse intends to store as much data as possible encrypted on-chain using MPC (Multi-Party Computation) powered encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. This ensures that only the user can decrypt their data, not even Pulse itself, providing confidence against hacks and unauthorized access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. The use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), a technology also explored by companies like Apple, allows insights to be derived from encrypted data without exposing it to third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. This approach aims to prevent data breaches like those experienced by 23andMe or Change Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

## Growth Strategy and [[building_communities_in_crypto | Community Building]]

Pulse's growth strategy for the next six months involves distinct phases:
1.  **Zero to 10,000 Users** Focus on building a "hardcore fan base" primarily within the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. This phase involves refining the app, positioning, and branding, and proving the product's stickiness and value for productivity and lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
2.  **10,000 to 100,000 Users** Shift to the "Normie Market" by engaging users on traditional social media platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Messaging will highlight how Pulse benefits diverse user groups, such as busy moms, students, or high performers, by enabling more energy, study time, or productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This phase will involve influencer marketing, paid advertising, and performance-based marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
3.  **Beyond 100,000 DAU** Once a healthy user base is established, Pulse plans to pursue data acquisition deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. With a large pool of users generating data, Pulse can approach companies interested in licensing this data to build products or develop services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

[[social_media_marketing_in_crypto | Social media marketing in crypto]] and the ability to [[building_communities_in_crypto | build communities]] are seen as a "superpower" for consumer crypto products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. Unlike traditional [[startups_in_crypto | startups in crypto]] that might pay users to "dog food" their product and spend significant effort to gather feedback, crypto projects inherently foster community and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. The ownership of tokens or, in Pulse's case, data, helps formulate strong communities around shared beliefs like privacy and self-sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

## Building on Monad
Pulse chose to build on Monad after initially considering other chains like Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. The decision was influenced by Monad's infrastructure, which meets Pulse's needs for speed and low latency, crucial for enhancing user experience in a non-DeFi application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

Furthermore, Monad's community aspect was a significant draw. The Monad team's pitch around consumer crypto resonated, and the community is already "pilled on the value that consumer crypto can bring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. This eliminated the need to convince users of Pulse's value proposition from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. The Monad ecosystem has demonstrated a strong focus on health and wellness, with initiatives like "iron nads," "Monad Run Club," and "Monad Gym Club," indicating a community that cares about optimizing productivity and long-term self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>.

Many common objections to starting a new endeavor, such as lacking time or feeling uncomfortable, are described as 100% excuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These objections often stem from fear or uncertainty about where to begin, leading to a sense of discomfort that is simply "literally life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Overcoming Initial Discomfort

Feeling uncomfortable, especially when doing something like talking to a camera, is a common experience, even for those who do it often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The key to overcoming this discomfort is simply to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

> "Just start doing it dude if you look at the old videos like are terrible you just start to get better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>

Initial attempts might be "terrible," but continuous practice leads to improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Developing Your Method

Through consistent practice, individuals gain a better understanding of how to deliver content and find a method that makes them feel comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The effectiveness of a personal process comes from having done it enough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

While one person's process may not work for another, each individual will discover their unique approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The only way to find this personal process is by "getting out and doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

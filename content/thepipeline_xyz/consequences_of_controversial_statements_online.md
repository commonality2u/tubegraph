## Unconventional Beliefs and Humor

One individual shared an "unconventional belief" regarding humor, stating that "traumatized children are funnier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The speaker clarified that this referred to "not like deep trauma but like a little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, suggesting that children might not be "funny" if "everyone's nice" to them and "only good thing to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

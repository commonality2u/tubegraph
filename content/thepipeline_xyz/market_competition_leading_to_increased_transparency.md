## User Resentment Towards Traditional Crypto Launches

Average cryptocurrency users often view new token launches as potential scams or as being driven by [[insider_dynamics_in_crypto_markets | insiders]], leading to a perception that "the rich [are] getting richer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A significant concern among users is the lack of opportunity to be early participants in promising ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This sentiment fosters resentment and momentum among crypto users regarding the dynamics of new coin creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Meme Coins: An Honest Alternative

As a result of these frustrations, some users choose to withdraw from traditional market participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. They instead opt to invest in meme coins, which are perceived as a "more honest" alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Meme coins are seen as fair due to the absence of insiders, creating a "very level playing field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The increasing popularity of meme coins is attributed to users being "sick of getting dumped on by insiders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Competition Driving Transparency

The rise of meme coins is expected to continue until crypto insiders are compelled to act more honestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This shift is driven by the realization among insiders that they are [[high_stakes_competition_and_reward_system | competing]] against the market's inherent desire for truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The preference for meme coins demonstrates a collective desire from users to "play our own game" free from perceived insider manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

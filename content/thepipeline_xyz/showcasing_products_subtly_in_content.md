When [[reasons_businesses_create_content | creating content to promote a business]], a common approach is to focus on the product's features and qualities, such as a sandwich shop highlighting "organically sourced vegetables" and "highest quality of meats" in a commercial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This method, however, can often come across as self-serving, characterized as "me me me look at what I do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Instead, a more effective strategy involves providing genuine value to the audience, positioning the product as a natural complement rather than the sole focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Value-Driven Content Examples

Consider the sandwich shop example:

*   **Traditional Approach:** A commercial directly promoting the sandwich's ingredients and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Subtle Approach:** The shop could [[creative_content_ideas_for_business_promotion | create a content series]] "around the best places to go on a picnic," simply bringing their sandwich along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This approach shifts the dynamic with the viewer by offering valuable information or entertainment, such as showcasing various picnic locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. In this scenario, the sandwich becomes "just the byproduct," mentioned without being the central theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

This method effectively positions the content so that the "audience is first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The fundamental principle for [[reasons_businesses_create_content | promoting a business through content]] is to prioritize "the value that you can provide to other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

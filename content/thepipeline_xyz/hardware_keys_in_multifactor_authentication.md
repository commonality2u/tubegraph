Hardware keys are one method that can be used in [[introduction_to_multifactor_authentication|multi-factor authentication (MFA)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These physical devices serve as a second method to verify a user's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. An example of this is using a physical key that asserts "this is who I am" during the authentication process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

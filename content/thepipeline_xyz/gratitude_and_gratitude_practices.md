An individual expressed their [[goals_and_gratitude | gratitude]] for specific aspects of their life when asked to list three things they were grateful for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Key areas of gratitude mentioned include:
*   **Relationships** The individual is grateful for the relationships they share with friends and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Work and Passion** Gratitude was also expressed for the opportunity to work on something they are extremely passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This passion leads to excitement upon waking every day, a stark contrast to a previous job three or four years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This highlights a significant aspect of [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness_in_work_life | personal growth and self-awareness in work life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Collaboration** An important self-realization that ties into gratitude is the inability to work alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As a triplet, the individual has always had people around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, and this preference for doing things with others extends to all their activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. They acknowledge not possessing the skills to accomplish everything independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The [[Monad public testnet launch | Monad public testnet]] is now live, offering an environment for users to interact with the ecosystem and provide feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Accessing the Testnet

To begin, navigate to the [[monad_testnet_introduction_and_setup | Monad Testnet landing page]] at testnet.monad.xyz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For [[understanding_monad_and_its_community | Monad community members]], an alternative link is available: monadtestnet.phantom.me, which integrates with the [[integration_of_phantom_with_monad_testnet | Phantom wallet experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Connecting Your Wallet

The initial step on the landing page is to connect your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Some wallets offer native testnet support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   For wallets requiring manual network addition, a button allows for auto-adding the testnet to wallets like MetaMask in a single step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Acquiring Testnet Tokens

After connecting your wallet, the next step is to [[acquiring_and_using_testnet_tokens | acquire testnet tokens]] via the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Paste your public wallet address into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Click "get testnet mod" to claim tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   The amount of tokens claimable varies based on several parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   The faucet refreshes throughout the day, so daily checks are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Making Your First Trade

Once you have `testnetm` in your wallet, you can make your first trade directly on the landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Three meme coins are available for trading: the House of Mandac, the House of Makaki, and the House of Chog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   These trades are facilitated by Blinks by Dialect and are powered by Uniswap, a day-one deployment on the testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Exploring Available Applications

After completing your first transaction, a range of [[available_applications_and_experiences_on_monad_testnet | experiences]] are available to explore on the testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>:
*   **Fantasy Top** has a tournament scheduled to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Featured applications on the main landing page include Rarebet Sports, 42KY, Kuru, Curv, and ANS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   An ecosystem directory is available and will be updated throughout the testnet phase with new applications and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This directory is the primary resource for discovering new activities on the [[Monad public testnet launch | Monad public testnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Users are encouraged to revisit this page frequently to stay updated on new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Engaging with various decentralized applications (dApps) and providing feedback to their development teams is crucial, as the testnet serves as a lower-stakes environment for testing new app experiences in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

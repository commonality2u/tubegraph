## Introduction to Ky
Ky is a social media betting application, described as one of the "coolest apps in all of crypto around anything social media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. It offers daily prediction markets where users can bet on their favorite teams, influencers, and internet content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. The core concept behind Ky is to take traditional sports betting models and apply them to the performance and metrics of social media creators and influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.

> [!info] Vision
> Ky aims to be "the home of social media betting" across various platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Kick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The long-term vision is to achieve mass market growth, allowing anyone to download and start playing the app in under 30 seconds, without requiring any specific Web3 knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.

## Key Features and User Experience
Ky's development emphasizes a strong [[innovations_in_user_experience_for_betting_platforms | user experience (UX) and user interface (UI)]], aiming for a Web2 feel on blockchain rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. The team does not use crypto benchmarks for UI/UX, instead striving for an app that is "good enough for everyone," comparable to popular mainstream apps like Instagram or TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>. Transactions are designed to be quick, with account setup and initial deposits happening in under 15-20 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

Recent updates include:
-   **Season One Launch** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>: Introduced gamification features such as a mission center and ranking system, making the app feel more like a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
-   **Expanded User Base** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>: The app has seen a dramatic increase in users and engagement following recent shout-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
-   **New Game Modes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>: Planned releases in the coming weeks and months are expected to "completely switch the model" and enhance the app's entertainment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Creator Engagement
Ky allows users to bet on the social media performance of creators and influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. The most popular markets often involve widely known figures like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Mr. Beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Additionally, popular creators within specific niches, such as the crypto and Web3 communities (e.g., Kona, KB, King Louie from the Monad ecosystem), also see high engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

> [!caution] Creator Onboarding
> Ky maintains a curated listing process for creators to ensure market integrity and protect users from manipulation. This is due to the inherent risks in [[social_media_betting | social media betting]], where small profiles could be easily influenced by external factors like bots to sway betting outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The process reviews engagement and views to determine if a market would be both engaging and safe for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This approach is analogous to how traditional [[revolutionizing_sports_betting_with_blockchain | sports betting]] platforms do not allow betting on high school games to maintain trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

More YouTube creators are planned for integration soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. The initial focus was on Twitter as Web3's most popular social media platform, with YouTube added due to its massive user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Ky is built on [[integration_of_crypto_and_blockchain_in_sports_betting | blockchain rails]], specifically leveraging Monad TestNet, which provides a fast and efficient platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. This technological foundation is crucial for delivering a Web2-like [[innovations_in_user_experience_for_betting_platforms | user experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

The app plans to launch real money markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>, with deposits on Monad Mainnet expected soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. Discussions also include the possibility of "non-monetary custom betting lines" for smaller profiles, allowing users to create permissionless markets for test net or casual betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. This could enable a "free-to-play" model as Ky transitions from TestNet to Mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. The team is also considering features like early cash-out systems, similar to traditional [[social_media_betting apps and technology entrepreneurship | betting apps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. These developments align with the broader [[future_of_online_gambling | future of online gambling]], particularly in [[future_trends_in_crypto_including_social_media_and_gaming | crypto including social media and gaming]].

> [!info] Community Engagement
> Ky actively engages with its community, considering user feedback for feature development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. The Monad ecosystem provides a dedicated niche and audience of users excited about speculation and early adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The app hosts influencers and creators from the Monad community, fostering [[community_engagement and strategies for RareBetSports | community engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

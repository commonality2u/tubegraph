Six-Man Ventures, an early-stage crypto fund founded in 2021, primarily focuses its investments at the application layer and has made over 100 investments across various crypto categories since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. As a venture capitalist, Carl, a partner at Six-Man Ventures, emphasizes that for [[Venture capital impact on crypto development | venture capital]] to be interested, a clear path to a 100x investment is necessary, as a 10x return is not considered interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Core Investment Philosophy: Enterprise Value Over Product
A fundamental principle for [[early_stage_founders | early-stage founders]] is that building enterprise value and a company is more crucial than merely building the "right product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While first-time founders often prioritize product, experienced founders focus on distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The goal for founders should be to create enterprise value for themselves, their employees, and the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Components of Enterprise Value
While revenue is the most straightforward and powerful way to value a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, other forms of enterprise value that investors consider include:
*   **Brand Awareness & Category Leadership:** Being the dominant entity in a particular crypto category suggests a pathway to future revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Proprietary Data:** Accumulated data across a wide customer base can be monetized in the future, providing a basis for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Partnerships & Distribution Channels:** Working with Tier 1 companies or having exclusive distribution can signal significant future revenue potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

Founders should consider the enterprise value they need to create for their next funding round and then plan the capital required to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Early-Stage Crypto Investments

### 1. Founder-Market Fit
For [[early_stage_founders | early-stage companies]] with minimal established metrics, founder-market fit is one of the most important factors for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This means the founders possess the ability to understand the market and the technical capacity to build the solution due to their background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Deep founder-market fit allows for quicker market understanding and access to relevant networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### 2. Co-Founder Selection
Choosing the right co-founder is arguably the most crucial decision for a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Building a business is incredibly challenging and often lonely, making a co-founder who is equally committed and vested vital for morale and sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Complementary Skills:** Ideally, co-founders should possess complementary skills (e.g., product sense, technical acumen, market analysis, community management) rather than being exact replicas of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Personality & Network:** Complementary personalities and diverse networks can significantly enhance a company's strength and ability to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Obsession:** Investors look for founders who are "all in" and obsessed with the problem space they are building in, as lack of obsession often leads to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### 3. Capital Management and Fundraising
*   **Cash Management:** For any founder, cash management is paramount, as running out of cash is the number one reason companies fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Fundraising:** The ability to communicate a compelling vision to the right investors is critical for securing necessary capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Dilution:** Teams often get into trouble by over-diluting too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Overly aggressive dilution in early rounds can make it difficult to attract large, meaningful investors in later rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Valuation vs. Partners:** Founders should not fret over a few percentage points in valuation if it means securing the right strategic partners who can enable success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The impact of a slightly lower valuation is less material for founders if the company achieves a massive outcome, while it can significantly affect investor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Margin of Safety:** Always raise capital with a margin of safety, avoiding overly optimistic projections, as market sentiment, meta trends, technology, and customer demand can change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

### 4. Focus on the "One Thing That Matters"
A founder's hardest job is to identify and execute the single most important thing that will guarantee company success, while ignoring all other noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   **Customers Over Features:** For a Series A round, investors look for customers, growth, and AUM/revenue, not just more features on a roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Shipping Over Tech Debt:** Startups have limited runway and should prioritize shipping new features and growing the product over extensive refactoring or addressing technical debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   **Depth Over Breadth:** Focusing on becoming an expert in one area and solving one problem deeply is more effective than being too broad, which can lead to an unscalable business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

### 5. Hiring and Team Building
*   **Hire Slowly, Fire Quickly:** Rushing hires and bringing on the wrong people can do more damage than not hiring anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. A bad hire, even if they own a small percentage of the company, can represent a significant operational drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Quality of Talent:** In the competitive crypto talent market, top engineers want to work in challenging environments free of "dead weight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
*   **Decisive Action:** If a hire is clearly wrong, it's essential to fire quickly, as waiting only prolongs the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

### 6. Get Out of Stealth
Staying in stealth mode is often detrimental, as the risk of irrelevance far outweighs the risk of ideas being copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Learning and Iteration:** Stealth prevents learning, iterating, customer feedback, advertising, and building excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Momentum and Market Anchor:** Launching without prior engagement leads to no day-one momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Being public allows a company to establish itself as the market anchor, against which competitors are measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Limited Runway:** Spending significant portions of a limited runway in stealth means not performing business-building activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
*   **Examples of Success:** Monad and Jito on Solana are examples of projects that successfully [[building_community_and_growth_strategies_in_the_crypto_space | built in the open]] and engaged their community before mainnet launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. [[gamefis_current_strategies_for_targeting_crypto_versus_mainstream_audiences | Photo Finish]], a virtual horse racing game, built community by launching NFTs that integrated with the game, ensuring engagement upon game launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

### 7. Relentless Pursuit of Product-Market Fit
[[startup_innovation in crypto | Product-market fit]] is defined as finding repeatable cases of "hell yes" customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Repeatable Solutions:** A product must serve a market repeatably, not require a different solution for each customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
*   **Customer Pull:** Instead of pushing a product, founders should aim for customers to "pull" the product, actively seeking it out due to clear problem-solving capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.
*   **Indicators of Product-Market Fit:**
    *   Customers continue to use the product even after pricing is introduced or increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. A strategy for pricing is to "double prices until somebody says no" to find true price discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
    *   Customers evangelize the product to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

### 8. Understanding Customer Behavior
*   **Customers Lie:** Founders should not ask customers what they want, as customers often cannot articulate their true needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.
*   **Focus on Actions and Goals:** Instead, ask customers what they *do* and what they are *trying to accomplish* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. This approach helps identify opportunities to build better experiences and create value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   **Avoid Excessive Experimentation:** Seed-stage companies with limited runway should avoid complex A/B testing and instead make decisive product decisions, as the risk of delay outweighs the risk of a wrong initial ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. This is another reason founder-market fit is valued, as it implies intuitive knowledge of what needs to be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

### 9. Simplicity Over Complexity
Simplicity is paramount in product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.
*   **Customer Attention:** Decreasing customer attention spans require products to make an impact very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.
*   **Technical Debt:** Complex products create more technical debt and can lead to feature bloat, burdening engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Clear Value Proposition:** Simplicity ensures a clear and easily digestible value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>.
*   **Indicators of Complexity:**
    *   Inability to describe the value proposition in two sentences or within 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>.
    *   Lack of a "delight moment" for customers within 60 seconds of onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.
    *   No singular call to action within the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.
    *   Continual adding of features without removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

### 10. Referral Codes as Value Proposition
Referral codes should not just be alphanumeric strings, but rather integrate the core product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. For example, Pay (a private crypto Venmo) required users to be paid by someone to onboard, immediately activating the product's value proposition of sending and receiving money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. This creates a much more compelling onboarding experience than just downloading an app with a zero balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

### Tokenomics and Market Share
In a discussion on market share versus revenue, especially in growing markets like Solana, market share is generally prioritized, particularly during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Companies like Helius (RPC provider) and Squads (multi-platform) focused on increasing market share, knowing that revenue could follow as the market recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

Regarding tokens, launching a token before a product often signals misaligned priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. However, tokens are incredibly important for the business's success, decentralization, and value sharing with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Founders must prioritize token liquidity to enable price discovery and allow value-add investors to increase their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

Airdrops, as part of [[building_community_and_growth_strategies_in_the_crypto_space | growth strategies]], should be focused on existing core product users rather than as an acquisition tool, and a smaller percentage (10-15%) of the total supply should be airdropped to preserve treasury for future engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. Ultimately, the product needs to be good enough that the airdrop is not the sole reason for usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

### Bootstrapping vs. Raising Capital
Founders should bootstrap for as long as possible to minimize early dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. However, raising capital becomes appropriate when it enables faster scaling once product-market fit is established, or when strategic investors can provide crucial connections and advice not accessible independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. For example, investors can leverage their network to introduce a DeFi protocol to large syndicates for initial liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.

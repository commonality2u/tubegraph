User experiences during high-demand events, such as NFT mints or other scenarios involving significant concurrent activity, can be highly variable, often characterized by [[high_transaction_volume_challenges | high transaction volume challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These events test the limits of blockchain systems and infrastructure, potentially leading to frustrating outcomes for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Challenges and Common Issues

During periods of intense network activity, users frequently encounter issues that disrupt their experience:
*   **System Failures**: Systems may fail to stand up to the load, leading to a need for excuses about why things went wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **RPC Failures**: Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services, critical for interacting with the blockchain, can fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Transaction Reversion**: Transactions may be submitted but subsequently reverted, leading to lost attempts and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Widespread Complaints**: These issues often surface on social media platforms like Twitter when problems arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

The goal for platforms is to avoid these common issues and not have to make excuses when things go wrong during high-stress situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Past User Experiences

A notable example of a challenging user experience during a high-demand period occurred on Solana in the fall of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This period was characterized by people from across the globe "spam clicking mint buttons," leading to unanticipated system stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Preparing for Future High-Demand Scenarios

To better prepare for and understand [[high_transaction_volume_challenges | high transaction volume challenges]], future stress testing could involve:
*   **AI Agents**: Utilizing AI agents on testnets to simulate high throughput and identify potential vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The combination of AI and [[discussion_on_high_throughput_blockchains | high throughput]] could yield interesting results, especially if AI is incentivized to intentionally stress or "crash" the test environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This approach considers not only human behavior but also the potential for automated "robot" clicking to generate even greater load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Optimized Performance**: Continuous monitoring and optimization efforts are necessary to ensure graceful handling of high transaction volumes and to mitigate potential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The aim is to create systems that can withstand super high stress, such as an NFT mint, without making excuses for failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

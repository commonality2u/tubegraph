## The Importance of Conviction

A primary piece of advice for [[early_stage_founders_and_leadership | founders]] in the crypto industry is to possess and maintain strong conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Ideas that initially appear outlandish or ridiculous are frequently proven correct years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. For instance, the early 2013 belief that Bitcoin would be widely used for payments, while not manifesting exactly as predicted, has seen its underlying thesis play out through the prevalence of stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Markets are dynamic and necessitate adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, this adaptation should not compromise the fundamental core beliefs of why one is involved in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Monad Games is a high-stakes, no-holds-barred [[competitions_and_surprise_challenges_in_monad_games | competition]] where five contestants battle to earn testnet tokens, known as T-Mo or Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The ultimate prize for the player with the most tokens is $5,000 to give away to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Conversely, the loser faces an undesirable fate, with the host stating, "you don't want to be in last place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The show features various [[challenges_and_tasks_in_degenerate_game_shows | challenges]] designed to test contestants' skills, endurance, and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Contestants

Before the games begin, contestants are introduced, each expressing varying levels of confidence in winning, ranging from "10" to a "50/50 chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Competition Rounds

The competition is structured into several rounds, each presenting a unique [[challenges_and_tasks_in_degenerate_game_shows | challenge]] and a chance to earn tokens.

### 1. Difficulty Choice and Cookie Carving Challenge

Contestants are initially given a choice between an "easy route" worth 200 Mana or a "hard route" worth 1,000 Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. All contestants collectively decide to choose the hard route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

The first physical [[challenges_and_tasks_in_degenerate_game_shows | challenge]] is a "Cookie Carving" game, inspired by *Squid Games* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Objective**: Carefully carve out a design from a cookie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Time Limit**: 7 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Penalty**: Immediate loss if the cookie breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   During this [[challenges_and_tasks_in_degenerate_game_shows | challenge]], contestants employ various strategies, including licking the cookie to thin it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Some contestants are eliminated after their cookies break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### 2. John's Mystery Meat Challenge

This [[challenges_and_tasks_in_degenerate_game_shows | challenge]] is an opportunity for contestants to earn back tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Contestants do not know which meat they are eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   Notable moments include reactions to eating "bull balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a> and a "Mountain Man" blend of elk, venison, antelope, wild boar, and bison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### 3. Influence Ranking Challenge

*   **Part 1: Self-Ranking**: Contestants first arrange themselves from most to least influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Part 2: Psychic Reading**: A professional psychic conducts a 5-minute reading with each contestant and then re-arranges them based purely on her intuition of their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
    *   **Reward**: 500 Mana if a contestant is placed in the exact same spot they put themselves in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

    *   **Reward**: 1,000 Mana if placed in the number one spot by the psychic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   This [[influence_and_engagement_in_social_media_contests | influence and engagement in social media contest]] revealed insights into the contestants' personalities, with some being described as "empaths" or preferring to "be in the back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### 4. Hot or Not: Pitch Competition

*   The winner of this round receives 1,500 Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. One notable pitch was "Couch Confessional," an AI priest for spilling secrets, which, in a V2, would reward users with tokens based on how "bad" their secrets were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

### 5. Ice Block Seed Phrase Extraction

Contestants choose a tool to extract a seed phrase frozen inside a block of ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

*   This round also featured a moment of [[psychological_elements_and_strategy_in_game_contests | psychological elements and strategy in game contests]], where one contestant bribed another for a missing word in the seed phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

### 6. Split or Steal: The Final Psychological Game

The final [[challenges_and_tasks_in_degenerate_game_shows | game]] is worth 2,500 tokens and tests trust and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   **Objective**: Each contestant secretly decides whether to "split" or "steal" the tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Outcomes**:
    *   If everyone chooses to "split," they each get 500 Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
    *   If only one person "steals," they take all the tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
    *   If two or more people "steal," the "splitters" get everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
    *   If three or more "steal," no one wins anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.
*   This game is described as a test of "trust, strategy, and maybe a little backstabbing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

## Winner and Final Outcome

Ultimately, Professor Pipelines (Danny) wins the entire Monad Games, securing the $5,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. Despite having "stolen" in the final round, Danny, who initially claimed "10 out of 10 conviction" of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>, decides to split his winnings among three other "OG Monad community members" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

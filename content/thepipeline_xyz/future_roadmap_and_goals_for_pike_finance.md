Pike Finance aims to become a [[pike_finances_role_in_the_defi_ecosystem | universal liquidity protocol]], unifying liquidity across various decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. This includes EVM environments like Ethereum, Optimism, and soon [[future_plans_for_monad_ecosystem_and_mainnet_launch | Monad]], as well as non-EVM ecosystems such as Solana, IBC/Cosmos, and Move-based parachains like Aptos and Sui [00:06:29].

### Core Principles

A key principle for Pike Finance is to eliminate the need for bridges by utilizing cross-chain messaging, primarily through Wormhole messaging [00:07:21]. Instead of sending assets across chains, Pike sends messages to facilitate borrowing against deposited assets on different chains [00:07:51]. This approach also means Pike only deals with native assets, avoiding "bridged assets" and their associated security concerns [00:08:23].

A long-term vision is to simplify the user experience by getting rid of prefixes and suffixes on assets (e.g., derivative tokens, receipt tokens) to make the ecosystem more accessible for millions of future users, including those new to crypto [00:08:49].

### Roadmap Milestones

The team has outlined several key milestones and areas of focus for the future:

*   **Live Cap Launch**
    The immediate next milestone for Pike Finance is the "live cap" launch, which is anticipated for March [00:44:05]. This phased launch allows the team to stress-test the system and ensure performance and reliability, especially given that building on arbitrary message bridges (AMBs) is still a new and complex area [00:16:10]. As of early February, the mainnet launch saw close to 4,000 unique wallet counts within five days, with most cross-chain messages registered on Arbitrum, followed by Optimism and Base [00:17:02]. This early activity demonstrates liquidity flowing between different chains [00:19:00].

*   **Exploring New Use Cases with High-Performance Chains**
    Pike's early commitment to [[future_plans_for_monad_ecosystem_and_mainnet_launch | Monad]] stems from its focus on performance and cost-efficiency [00:10:05]. This high-performing EVM environment will enable Pike to trial new cross-chain lending use cases [00:44:31]. A specific example includes supporting new types of assets like Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) [00:44:53]. Pike predicts that LSTs and LRTs will expand beyond Ethereum to other ecosystems with staking assets [00:45:07]. [[future_plans_for_monad_ecosystem_and_mainnet_launch | Monad]] is envisioned as a potential hub to connect liquidity with other chains, a concept currently in the research and ideation phase for the mid-term horizon [00:45:24].

*   **Cross-Chain Governance**
    A longer-term objective for Pike Finance is to implement cross-chain governance [00:46:02]. As Arbitrary Message Bridges (AMBs) become more robust, enabling more applications to build across multiple chains, the challenge of rolling out governance across these disparate chains becomes significant [00:46:16]. Pike aims to leverage cross-chain governance to minimize the overhead for builders while ensuring broad participation across all chains where Pike is deployed [00:46:59].

Ultimately, Pike Finance's long-term vision is to create a "Melting Pot" concept that applies not only to liquidity but also to community engagement and governance participation [00:47:25]. This approach aligns with a commitment to fostering a strong, engaged community that can organically contribute to the protocol's presence and growth [00:32:08].

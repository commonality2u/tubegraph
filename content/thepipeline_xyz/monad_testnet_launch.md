From: [[thepipeline_xyz]] <br/> 

The [[monad_public_testnet_introduction | public testnet]] for Monad is finally going live, marking a significant milestone that many have contributed to over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This launch is considered by the Monad team not as a finish line, but as the starting line for continued development and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Unpacking Monad's Unique Approach

[[Monad Labs and blockchain technology | Monad Labs]] has taken a unique approach to building its protocol by developing everything from the ground up, rather than forking an existing open-source project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

### Reasons for Building From Scratch
*   **Technical Control**: Building from scratch provides greater technical control over the product, allowing specificity in how memory allocation, disk interaction, and other low-level aspects are implemented for optimal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Friction**: Forking an existing project would have required so many modifications that the benefits of leveraging ongoing maintenance or new features from the original project would have been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **High Performance EVM**: Monad was specifically envisioned as a high-performance EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chain with minimal design restrictions, except for achieving 100% EVM compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This contrasts with Ethereum clients that are arbitrarily rate-limited to lower throughput to maintain low node requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   **Targeting Consumer-Grade Nodes**: A goal was set to ensure Monad nodes could run on consumer-grade machines, such as a $1,000 PC, rather than requiring expensive server machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

### Challenges of Building from Scratch
Building from scratch is a massive undertaking that requires a unique skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Low-level system engineers, who are crucial for such work, are typically found in large tech companies, silicon manufacturing, or high-frequency trading firms, making them difficult to recruit in the blockchain space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

## Key Innovations and Performance

Monad's core innovation lies in optimizing transaction execution to ensure the machine is always busy, leveraging concurrency and addressing disc access bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

### Concurrent Execution and Pipelining
Unlike most existing clients that are single-core for transaction execution, Monad aims to utilize multiple cores through concurrent execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. This involves intelligently pipelining transactions within a block, even with dependencies, to work on multiple tasks simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. The "washing machine" analogy describes this: just as one can wash, dry, and fold different loads of laundry concurrently, Monad processes different sets of transactions at various stages of execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

### Database Optimization
A major challenge is preventing the CPU from idly waiting for slow disc access, which can take 30 microseconds or more per access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Monad addressed this by building its own database to optimize disc interactions and keep the CPU busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

## [[Monads Devnet announcement and significance | Monad's Devnet]] vs. [[monad_public_testnet_introduction | Public Testnet]]

### [[Monads Devnet announcement and significance | Devnet]]
The [[Monads Devnet announcement and significance | Devnet]] served as an early feedback loop for testers and infrastructure providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:35:00">[0:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:39:00">[0:39:00]</a>. It allowed Monad to continuously run replays, gather metrics (TPS, gas per second), and identify unanticipated use patterns that required further optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:44:00">[0:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:47:00">[0:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:55:00">[0:55:00]</a>.

A notable benchmark on Devnet saw a team send 3 trillion gas worth of usage in a couple of hours, simulating a huge number of complex exchange orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:00">[0:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:00">[0:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This amount of gas is equivalent to about 30 days of Ethereum's throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### [[monad_public_testnet_introduction | Public Testnet]] Benchmarking
Monad benchmarks its performance by replaying actual Ethereum history, not just simple token transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Simple token transfers are easily achievable even by unoptimized, single-core clients (e.g., 50k TPS on early Ethereum history) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Monad aims to handle the complexity of real-world Ethereum usage, including taxing protocols like AMMs, lending protocols, and even extremely expensive ZK-proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The focus is on real usage and pushing TPS and gas per second, even with very expensive computations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## What Monad Unlocks

Monad offers a performant version of shared global state with built-in payment rails and programmability, enabling anyone to build and distribute applications to millions or hundreds of millions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

### Key Verticals and Use Cases
*   **High Fidelity DeFi**: Enabling personal finance to scale to hundreds of millions of users with extremely cheap transaction fees and low slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Consumer Space (dPIN)**: Supporting applications that need to scale to hundreds of millions of users and require Monad's throughput of over a billion transactions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This includes areas like marketplaces for health data or any type of device data where large numbers of consumers contribute resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Gas Fee Abstraction**: Monad's low transaction costs make it feasible for applications to sponsor gas fees, simplifying the user experience and enabling sustainable business models for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Addressing Misconceptions and Future Vision

A common misconception is viewing the launch of [[monad_public_testnet_introduction | testnet]] and [[Monads plans for Testnet and Mainnet | mainnet]] as the "finish line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. For Monad, it's considered the "starting line" for a massive queue of ideas, including further optimizations, rewrites, new features for usability and privacy, and increased decentralization to support thousands of nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

Monad challenges the narrative that technology doesn't matter or that go-to-market strategy is more important than technological innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. By bringing multiple new, innovative technologies to market, Monad aims to push the decentralization-performance tradeoff curve forward substantially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. This launch is merely the beginning of a much broader effort to grow the crypto space through new applications and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

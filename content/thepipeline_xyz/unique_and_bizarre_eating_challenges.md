"Monad Games" featured several [[competitions_and_surprise_challenges_in_monad_games | competitions and surprise challenges]], including two unique eating challenges that tested the contestants' palates and endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## John's Mystery Meat

This challenge offered contestants an opportunity to earn 100 "montans" (tokens) for each piece of random meat they chose to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The contestants were not told what kind of meat they were eating until after they had tasted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. All meats served were safe to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

The assortment of meats included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>:
*   Alligator
*   Bison
*   Yak
*   Kangaroo
*   Wild Boar
*   Rabbit
*   Rattlesnake
*   Antelope
*   Venison
*   Rocky Mountain Oysters (bull balls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
*   Traditional Chicken Sausage

Reactions varied, with some describing the taste as "pretty good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> or even having a "nice" smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. One contestant noted a meat tasted "kind of like a like an [[weird_food_combinations_with_apples | apple cinnamon]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. However, other reactions included describing a meat as looking "a little sus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, tasting "like poop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, or being "awful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Ultimately, two contestants ate all the meats, while others missed eating the "balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Hot or Not Pitch Challenge

This challenge combined a business pitch competition with a spicy food eating component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Contestants had 60 seconds to pitch a random startup idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. They could choose to eat one of three items, with increasing heat levels corresponding to higher potential token rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>:
*   Jelly beans (worth 200 mana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>
*   The world's hottest chocolate (worth 500 mana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>
*   The One Chip Challenge (worth a whopping 2,000 mana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>

While contestants didn't *have* to eat an item to pitch, doing so increased their potential score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Yogurt smoothies were provided for relief, but drinking them before the pitch time was up resulted in losing points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

One contestant attempted the world's hottest chocolate, expressing fear beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> and later stating, "I'm starting to foam up here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a> and "It really hurts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. The winner of this round was the "Intern," who earned 1,500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

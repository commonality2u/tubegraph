The [[monad_public_testnet_launch | Monad public test net]] is now live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Day one activities for users involve connecting a wallet, acquiring testnet tokens, and engaging with available applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Connecting Your Wallet
To begin, navigate to the [[monad_testnet_introduction_and_setup | Monad testnet]] landing page at `testnet.monad.xyz` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Community members can also access it via `monadtestnet.phantom.me` for a specific [[integration_of_phantom_with_monad_testnet | Phantom wallet]] experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The first step on the landing page is to connect your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While some wallets offer native testnet support, others may require manual network addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This process is straightforward; a single button click can auto-add the testnet to wallets like MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Acquiring Testnet Tokens via the Faucet
After connecting your wallet, the next step is to obtain testnet tokens through the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This is a very easy process: simply paste your public wallet address into the designated field and click "get testnet mod" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The quantity of tokens claimable by your wallet may vary based on certain parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The faucet refreshes throughout the day, so users are encouraged to check it daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Making Your First Trade
Once testnet tokens are acquired, users can make their first trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The platform features three meme coins: Mandac, Makaki, and Chog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These can be purchased directly on the landing page, enabled by Blinks by Dialect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The coins themselves are powered by Uniswap, a key day-one deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Trades, such as buying Chogs, are notably fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Exploring Testnet Applications
Following an initial transaction on the testnet, a wide range of experiences are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Day one highlights include:
*   **Fantasy Top** - With a tournament starting the day after launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Featured Apps** - Located on the main landing page, including Rare Bet Sports, 42 KY, Kuru, Curv, and ANS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Directory** - An evolving resource that will be regularly updated with new apps and experiences throughout the testnet phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The ecosystem directory is the primary place to discover new activities on the [[monad_testnet_introduction_and_setup | Monad public test net]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Users are advised to frequently check this page to avoid missing exciting opportunities to interact with the testnet and experiment with new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. A key purpose of the testnet is to deploy new application experiences and test them in a lower-stakes, lower-risk environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, so users are encouraged to try out various dApps and provide feedback to the development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Fitz, who works on the [[Growth and development of the Monad community | ecosystem]] at Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, shared some of his personal favorites and preferences related to [[Introduction to Monad and its capabilities | Monad]] and its community.

## Explaining Monad to a Child

When asked to explain [[Introduction to Monad and its capabilities | Monad]] to a 5-year-old, Fitz offered an analogy related to trade and permanence:
> "It's sort of a place where you can put your snacks or your toys and trade them for other snacks and toys and they will always be there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>

## Preferred Pronunciation

Fitz clarified his preferred pronunciation of "Monad":
> "I say Monad. I think the average English speaker reads it and wants to say Monad, but to each his own." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

## Favorite Monad Animal

Fitz's favorite Monad animal is "Li ra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. He chose this because he likes the "really abstract ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> or those that are "not at all popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, noting that "Li ra" almost never gets mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Community Member to Purge

When asked to purge one person from the [[Understanding Monad and its community | Monad community]], Fitz jokingly chose "John W rich kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, desiring for him to "get a taste of his own medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Hypothetical Monad Animal Band Name

When prompted to name a band composed of Monad animals, Fitz struggled to come up with an immediate answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, considering references from "Classics metal" bands like Black Sabbath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> but ultimately needing more time to think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

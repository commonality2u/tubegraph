The [[monad_public_test_net_launch | Monad public test net]] is now live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This marks a significant milestone that the community has been anticipating for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. To begin interacting with the test net, the first step is to connect your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Accessing the Monad Test Net Landing Page

To access the Monad Test Net, you can navigate to `testnet.monad.xyz` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. For existing Monad community members, an alternative is to go to `monadtestnet.phantom.me` for a Phantom wallet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Connecting Your Wallet

Upon reaching the [[monad_testnet_launch | test net]] landing page, the initial action required is to connect your digital wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

*   **Wallet Compatibility**: Some wallets offer native support for the test net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Manual Network Addition**: If your wallet does not have native support, you may need to manually add the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This process is simplified by an auto-add button, which allows you to integrate the test net into wallets like MetaMask in a single step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Once connected, your wallet will be ready for interaction with the Monad Test Net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Obtaining Test Net Tokens via Faucet

After successfully connecting your wallet, the next step is to acquire test net tokens using the provided faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

*   **Process**: Simply paste your public wallet address into the designated field and click "Get Test Net Monad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Claim Limits**: The amount of tokens you can claim varies based on several parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Faucet Refresh**: The faucet refreshes throughout the day, so it's recommended to check it daily for more tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Having test net tokens enables you to begin making transactions and exploring the various applications and experiences available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. For example, you can [[making_transactions_on_monad_test_net | make your first trade]] of meme coins directly on the landing page, powered by Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Exploring the Ecosystem

The Monad Test Net offers a multitude of experiences from day one, including featured applications like Fantasy Top, Rare Bet Sports, 42 KY, Kuru, and Curv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. An ecosystem directory is available on the main landing page, which will be regularly updated with new apps and experiences throughout the test net phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Users are encouraged to try out various dApps and provide feedback to the development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The purpose of the test net is to deploy and test new application experiences in a lower-stakes, lower-risk environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

An analogy was proposed for explaining [[blockchain_for_beginners | blockchain]] to extraterrestrial beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

> "if you had to build a spaceship but you had to purchase each one uh sorry each piece part by part and the goal was to get your spaceship to fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

Despite the attempt, the proposed analogy was met with the reaction, "Oh my gosh that makes zero sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Average crypto users often view new token launches as insider-driven scams where the rich get richer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Even when genuine opportunities arise, the average user lacks the chance to participate early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This fosters resentment towards the dynamics of how new coins are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. As a result, users may choose to disengage from such markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> and instead gravitate towards what they perceive as more honest alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Perceived Fairness and Accessibility

A primary reason for investing in [[meme_coins]] is the perception of honesty and fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Key attributes include:
*   **No Insiders** There are no insiders involved in [[meme_coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

*   **Level Playing Field** They offer a very level playing field for all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Users are increasingly opting for [[meme_coins]] because they are "sick of getting dumped on by insiders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, preferring to "play their own game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

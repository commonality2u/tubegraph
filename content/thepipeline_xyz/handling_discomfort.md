Discomfort is a natural part of initiating new activities, such as speaking to a camera. The speaker notes that even they still feel uncomfortable often when doing so, and frequently "get hung up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Overcoming Initial Discomfort
The key to handling discomfort is simply to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Initial attempts may be "terrible," but consistent practice leads to improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Over time, individuals develop a "feel" for how to deliver or perform, figuring out methods that make them comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This comfort comes from doing the activity enough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Finding Your Process
While one person's process might work for them, it may not work for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The only way to discover your own effective process is by actively engaging in the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Identifying Excuses
Many objections to starting something new, such as lacking time, are identified as "100% an [[overcoming_excuses | excuse]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. These excuses often stem from being scared or not knowing where to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

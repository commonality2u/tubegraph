For any founder, [[importance_of_securing_funds_and_accounts | cash management]] is paramount. The primary reason companies fail is running out of cash [00:03:52]. Therefore, founders must be acutely aware of where their cash is stored, how much they possess, and their burn rate [00:03:57].

## Fundraising

[[purples_fundraising_and_growth_strategy | Fundraising]] is a critical component of a company's success. Companies often succeed or fail based on their ability to articulate a compelling vision to the appropriate investors, who then provide the necessary capital [00:04:06]. This aspect is a key part of [[challenges_and_strategies_for_crypto_startups | Challenges and Strategies for Crypto Startups]].

### Optimizing for Massive Financial Outcomes

When taking venture capital, founders must optimize for a massive financial outcome [00:10:04]. A venture investor, especially at the pre-seed stage, seeks a path to at least a 100x return, as a 10x return is generally not considered an interesting outcome [00:10:29].

### Avoiding Over-Dilution

A common pitfall for teams is over-diluting too early in the business lifecycle [00:10:47]. For example, a pre-seed round with 20% dilution might be acceptable, but if a subsequent round adds another significant dilution (e.g., reaching 40% total), it severely limits future capital raises and allocations for elements like community tokens [00:11:03]. A strong recommendation is that if a round involves substantial dilution, the subsequent round should avoid further excessive dilution [00:11:38].

However, founders should not be overly concerned about a few percentage points in valuation if it secures the right strategic partners [00:12:15]. Achieving a billion-dollar outcome is exceptionally difficult, and optimizing for the highest chance of success by having the right people on board is more valuable [00:12:27]. A 5% difference in founder's personal wealth (e.g., $30 million on a billion-dollar outcome) is less material compared to a 25% difference in return for a tier-one investor [00:13:32]. It is preferable to accept slightly less equity and win, rather than failing due to a lack of the right partners [00:14:28].

### The Goal of Capital: Creating Enterprise Value

The primary goal of raising capital is to create [[valuedriven_marketing_strategies | Enterprise Value]] [00:14:38]. While product managers focus on product, CEOs must think about Enterprise Value [00:14:59].

Enterprise Value can manifest in various forms beyond just revenue:
*   **Revenue** The most straightforward and powerful indicator [00:15:07].
*   **Brand Awareness** Becoming a recognized leader in a crypto category [00:15:24].
*   **Data** Accumulating proprietary data that can be monetized in the future [00:15:46].
*   **Partnerships** Collaborations with tier-one companies [00:16:05].
*   **Distribution Channels** Exclusive access to large customer bases (e.g., Fireblocks) [00:16:12].

Founders should consider the specific types of Enterprise Value they need to create to secure their next funding round, and then determine the capital required to reach those milestones [00:16:54].

### Raising with a Margin of Safety

Always raise capital with a margin of safety [00:17:03]. It is unrealistic to assume precise planning for runway, as market sentiment, trends (e.g., AVS valuations), technology, and customer demand can change rapidly [00:17:19]. Building in a buffer is crucial to mitigate unforeseen challenges [00:17:51].

### Bootstrapping vs. Raising Capital

Bootstrapping for as long as possible is generally encouraged, as it allows founders to dilute less of their business over time and potentially raise at later, more advanced stages [00:58:29].

However, raising capital becomes strategic when:
*   **Accessing Connections** Investors can provide crucial connections and endorsements, helping accelerate the business beyond what could be achieved alone [00:59:06]. For instance, a respected capital allocator's endorsement can attract more syndicates [00:59:27].
*   **Accelerated Scaling** If a company has found product-market fit and is growing at a certain pace, capital can enable a significantly faster growth trajectory, preventing loss of market position to quicker competitors [00:59:41].

In summary, delay taking on capital until products and theses are proven, but raise when it enables quicker scaling or provides essential connections and advice [01:00:00].

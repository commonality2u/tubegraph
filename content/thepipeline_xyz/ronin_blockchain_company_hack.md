The Ronin blockchain, a company known for its popular game, Axi, experienced a significant security breach. The parent company, Sky Mavis, was at the center of the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## How the Hack Occurred

The hack began with a [[Security concerns and solutions in blockchain ecosystems | phishing]] attack targeting a DevOps Engineer at Sky Mavis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The engineer was sent a job offer, and it is believed they clicked on an executable file within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This constituted a single point of failure within Sky Mavis's security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Through this initial compromise, the attacker gained access to the engineer's device, which provided them with four keys for a multi-signature (multi-sig) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A multi-sig acts like a door requiring multiple keys to unlock it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In this specific case, five out of nine total keys were required to unlock the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The attackers used [[Security concerns and solutions in blockchain ecosystems | social engineering]] to obtain the initial four keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Subsequently, they performed "lateral movement" by moving from the compromised device to another to acquire the fifth necessary key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Once all five keys were obtained, they were able to fully compromise the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Impact of the Hack

The Ronin blockchain hack resulted in one of the largest, if not the largest, hacks in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The financial damage amounted to approximately half a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The incident highlights how a seemingly innocuous official email could lead to such extensive damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Pancakes BR, a prominent figure in crypto Twitter known for his "wholesome vibes," has a background in the music industry, having managed artists since he was 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:46">[02:57:46]</a>. He discovered crypto in 2017 while working in music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>. After initially observing the space and losing money, he decided to travel and eventually left the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Despite this, he has recently considered advising artists or managing musicians again in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

## Core Problem in the Music Industry

Pancakes BR is "extremely bullish on crypto completely disrupting the music industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. He identifies a significant issue: approximately 70% of money in music never reaches the artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. Since 2017, he has believed that crypto could provide a solution to this problem, particularly through protocols that can ensure artists are paid quickly and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

## The Role of NFTs

While bullish on crypto's overall potential in music, Pancakes BR expresses skepticism about [[future_potential_use_cases_for_crypto_and_blockchain | music NFTs]] being the primary answer for disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. He acknowledges examples of good utility, such as Rolling Loud's "Loud Punks" NFTs, which provide perpetual VIP access to their festivals, calling it "the most utility I've seen NFT have yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. However, he generally doesn't believe NFTs will be the solution for the music side of things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

He reflects on the NFT bull run, stating he goes "back and forth on if the NFT bull run was good or bad for the space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.
*   **Positive aspects**: It brought in many new people interested in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>.
*   **Negative aspects**:
    *   Many newcomers made quick money accidentally, developing egos without understanding bare markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.
    *   There was "a lot of grifting that happened within that space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
    *   Mainstream figures, including music executives, were "extremely put off from crypto because of the NFT bull run" and related grifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.
    *   He anticipates an "NFT grift Bull Run 2.0" in the next cycle, potentially "even bigger this time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.

## Broader [[future_of_crypto_applications_and_use_cases | Applications and Use Cases]]

Pancakes BR emphasizes the need to understand "what does everyone else care about in the world" and whether crypto technology can "improve that experience for them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>. He believes crypto can "improve almost any vertical in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.

For mass adoption, he suggests that crypto's breakthrough will likely come through [[the_relationship_between_crypto_and_social_media | social media platforms]] or applications that are genuinely fun, rather than just being "crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. This aligns with where people spend their time: watching TikToks, tweeting, Instagram, Netflix, attending shows, and enjoying music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.

He also notes that while gaming is a social activity and many people play video games, he is "a little bit more bearish on the video game side of things" for crypto, with some exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>. This is because most crypto games so far have focused on "play to make money," which is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. Additionally, it is inherently difficult to make a fun game, even for established studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. He believes it will take traditional gaming companies to find value in crypto technology and integrate it themselves, rather than crypto-native teams building the next big game from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

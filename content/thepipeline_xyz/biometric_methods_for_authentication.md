Biometric authentication is a form of [[introduction_to_multifactor_authentication|multifactor authentication]] (MFA) that verifies a user's identity based on their unique biological characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

It serves as a second method to confirm that the person accessing an account is who they claim to be, in addition to a password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

A very common example of biometric authentication used as a means of [[common_methods_of_multifactor_authentication|MFA]] is Face ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem of Misinformation
Misinformation and disinformation are significant issues in crypto today, particularly regarding awareness and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. As technology scales and reaches more users, the amount of noise around it inevitably increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Root Causes
One primary cause of misinformation stems from individuals who are not necessarily technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Their backgrounds may not provide them with sufficient domain knowledge in complex blockchain engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. For example, a political science major might not understand intricate blockchain engineering as well as the engineers building these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Often, those lecturing engineers about system building have gained wealth early by being early investors in a particular coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This creates a scenario where people look up to them because of their financial success, leading to a situation where the "blind lead the blind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Impact
Many individuals are afraid to correct misinformation, fearing it might appear "too mean" or "burn some bridges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This reluctance allows complete lies and narratives to circulate, potentially affecting the work of those doing great work on specific networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

A major challenge for [[challenges_and_strategies_for_crypto_startups | startups]] in the tech industry, including crypto, is not just building the technology but also getting people to care enough to build on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. In crypto, this is often dominated by noise and even politics, such as debates over L1s versus L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

### Proposed Solutions
To combat misinformation, there is a need for more "builders" to speak out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Engineers and builders sometimes hesitate to speak because they fear even a minor inaccuracy might lead to judgment from other smart people, or they believe that building the best product will naturally attract users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. However, in a noisy environment where attention is scarce, this passive approach is unlikely to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Solutions include:
*   **More Builders Speaking Out:** Actively producing content like podcasts and written articles can foster a meritocracy of ideas, allowing the best concepts to rise to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Checks and Balances:** Encouraging open discourse where people can affirm truths or correct falsehoods is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Taboo Concepts:** It is important to prevent situations where certain topics or criticisms are disallowed, stifling valuable conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. While challenging, speaking up is often more beneficial than remaining silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

> "Most people are kind of afraid or whatever to check that kind of stuff because they're like oh well it'll it'll be too mean or it'll you know uh burn some bridges and whatnot but but I think like while it's important to not be like directly insulting to people it's I think pretty fair to like correct the misinformation so that you know people who who are doing great work on a certain Network aren't affected by complete lies and narratives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>

The presence of misinformation is acknowledged as a "huge problem in crypto today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The [[the_relationship_between_crypto_and_social_media | crypto Twitter]] presence of knowledgeable individuals helps in addressing this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The ongoing "validator debates" also highlight the need for clear communication and education within the community, especially concerning complex technical trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

Ultimately, addressing misinformation requires persistent effort and a commitment to fostering an environment where accurate information and genuine discourse can thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

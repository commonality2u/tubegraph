Misinformation and disinformation pose a significant challenge in the crypto space, impacting awareness and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Root Causes of Misinformation

A primary source of misinformation stems from individuals who are not technical and lack sufficient domain knowledge in blockchain engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. For example, some individuals with backgrounds like political science may attempt to lecture engineers on how to build complex blockchain systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Many purveyors of misinformation gained wealth by being early adopters of certain cryptocurrencies, leading to a "blind leading the blind" scenario where inexperienced individuals look up to them for financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Furthermore, there is a general reluctance to correct false information, often out of fear of being perceived as "too mean" or "burning bridges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This reluctance prevents necessary checks and balances, allowing complete lies and narratives to affect those doing valuable work on networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Addressing Misinformation

To combat misinformation, it is crucial for more "builders" – individuals directly involved in developing blockchain systems – to speak out and produce content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. However, many builders are often hesitant to do so, either because they perceive a small part of their statement might be inaccurate or they believe that a superior product should speak for itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This passive approach is ineffective in a noisy environment where attention is scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The goal should be to foster a meritocracy of ideas, where the best concepts rise to the top through open discourse and continuous checks and balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Concepts that become "taboo" and prevent open discussion, such as avoiding criticism of a specific protocol or public figure, are counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. While speaking up can sometimes lead to trouble, it is ultimately more beneficial than remaining silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. As technology scales and reaches a broader user base, increased noise and potential for misinformation are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Examples of Misinformation in Marketing

Misinformation can also manifest in marketing strategies. For instance, some proponents of L2s (Layer 2 solutions) exaggerate their capabilities, implying that L2s are the sole path forward for crypto and can solve all problems, including global issues like world hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. These individuals may also downplay the capabilities of Layer 1 (L1) blockchains to promote their L2 solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. The notion that L2s are the "savior of crypto" is a problematic marketing approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

The announcement of Devnet marked a significant milestone for [[what_is_monad|Monad]] supporters globally and within the EVM landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It represents a crucial development for [[what_is_monad|Monad]], signaling progress in its mission to enhance blockchain performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## What is Devnet?

Devnet is a fully functional blockchain environment specifically for the [[what_is_monad|Monad]] blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It signifies the unification of all four optimizations of [[what_is_monad|Monad]]'s tech stack, a culmination of nearly two years of crafting and optimizing various parts of the blockchain across both execution and consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Key components integrated into Devnet include:
*   The consensus engine, which is the core of [[what_is_monad|Monad]] BFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   The execution engine, enabling parallelized execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Their interactions through [[what_is_monad|Monad]] DB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

This integration forms a cohesive, fully functioning system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Accessibility and Future Milestones

Currently, Devnet is solely an internal environment used by the [[what_is_monad|Monad]] core team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This means it is not yet accessible to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The next significant milestone for [[what_is_monad|Monad]] is the launch of its Testnet, which will allow for broader access and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Redefining TPS: [[what_is_monad|Monad]]'s Approach

One of the headlines surrounding Devnet has been its achievement of 10,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS) on the EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. However, TPS is often a misleading metric due to the lack of a universal measurement standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a> and the variability in transaction complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Theoretical vs. Real TPS
*   **Theoretical TPS** refers to an artificially high number achieved by simplifying environments or using only simple transaction data like transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. These "transfer-only scenarios" do not reflect real-world blockchain usage, which involves complex smart contract interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Real TPS**, in contrast, is based on the actual complexity of transactions seen in live environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

[[what_is_monad|Monad]] defines and measures TPS using real, historical Ethereum data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. By replaying recent Ethereum transactions on the [[what_is_monad|Monad]] blockchain, [[what_is_monad|Monad]] provides a more realistic and accurate view of its true performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This approach leverages [[what_is_monad|Monad]]'s EVM compatibility, allowing applications deployed on Ethereum to also run on [[what_is_monad|Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This ensures that the measured TPS reflects the demands of a modern blockchain environment with complex smart contract interactions, rather than simple transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Devnet's Place in [[monads_plans_and_milestones_for_the_coming_year|Monad's Broader Strategy]]

Devnet is the first of many exciting milestones for [[what_is_monad|Monad]] this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Its purpose is to "dog food" the blockchain, allowing the core team to identify internal strengths and areas for further optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. As a software company, [[what_is_monad|Monad]] emphasizes continuous improvement through iterations of code development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Devnet is a critical step in this iterative process, leading towards continued improvements of the [[what_is_monad|Monad]] blockchain as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

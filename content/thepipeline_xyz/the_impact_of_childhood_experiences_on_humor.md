## Unconventional Belief

An unconventional belief proposes that children who have experienced some form of "trauma" tend to be funnier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This perspective clarifies that it refers to a "little" amount of adversity rather than deep trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is suggested that if a child only experiences positive interactions and good things, they may not develop humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Role of Adversity

The concept implies that a childhood that is "just all rainbows" may not be beneficial for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, hinting at [[the_balance_between_protecting_children_and_exposing_them_to_challenges | the balance between protecting children and exposing them to challenges]]. While not every upbringing aims to optimize for humor, there is an assertion that some level of challenge is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is noted that [[the_role_of_suffering_in_personal_growth | suffering]] can lead to growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> and contribute to the development of [[the_importance_of_resilience_and_grit_in_development | grit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

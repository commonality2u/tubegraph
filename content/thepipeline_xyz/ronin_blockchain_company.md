Ronin is a [[Monad blockchain development|blockchain]] company known for its popular game, Axi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Sky Mavis served as Ronin's parent company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Ronin Bridge Hack

The Ronin blockchain experienced what might be the largest hack in history, resulting in approximately half a billion dollars in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Initial Compromise

The incident originated when a devops engineer from Sky Mavis was "fished" with a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is believed that the engineer clicked on an executable file sent as part of this phishing attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Vulnerability and Multi-Signature Keys

A critical point of failure was that the compromised device of this single individual gained access to four keys for a multi-signature wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A multi-signature (multisig) wallet is designed like a door requiring multiple keys to unlock it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In this specific case, the multisig required five keys out of nine possible keyholes to be unlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Key Acquisition and Exploit

Through social engineering tactics targeting the engineer, the attackers initially acquired four of the necessary keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They then performed "lateral movement" — moving from the compromised device to another — to obtain an additional key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This allowed them to accumulate all five required keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, granting them full access to exploit the system. The entire compromise, leading to significant financial loss, originated from what appeared to be an office email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

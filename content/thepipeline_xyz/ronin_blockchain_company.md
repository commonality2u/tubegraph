Ronin is a blockchain company that developed the popular game "Axi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its parent company is [[Sky Mavis | Sky Mavis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Ronin Network Hack Incident

The Ronin blockchain network was subjected to a significant hack, potentially the largest in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The incident resulted in the exploitation of approximately half a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The attack originated from a social engineering scheme where a DevOps Engineer from [[Sky Mavis | Sky Mavis]] was phished with a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The engineer reportedly clicked on an executable file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Exploitation Details

*   **Initial Access:** The engineer's compromised device gained access to four keys required for a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Multi-Sig Definition:**
    > "Multi-sig is basically just a door with like many keys to unlock it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
    In this case, five out of nine keys were needed to unlock the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Lateral Movement:** After obtaining four keys through social engineering, the attackers performed lateral movement within the network, moving from the engineer's compromised device to another to acquire an additional key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Total Access:** This allowed the attackers to accumulate all five necessary keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Impact:** The exploit, triggered by what started as an office email, led to massive financial damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Introduction to Pulse

Pulse is a consumer-facing product on the cutting edge of wearable technology, uniquely combining both software and hardware components in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The team behind Pulse, including founder Nix, is passionate about consumer crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Inspiration and Vision

Nix, a lifelong founder since 2010, initially ignored his health, focusing instead on building startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. As he aged, he realized his body was not responding as it used to, leading to a focus on graceful aging and personal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This personal journey inspired Pulse, driven by the belief that taking care of one's body can enhance productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Pulse: A Lifestyle Wearable

Pulse is defined as a lifestyle wearable, not solely a health wearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Its design aims to help users across various life aspects beyond just health, utilizing collected data to enable individuals to become better operators, builders, and generally improved humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

The vision is not just to make people healthier, but to help them gain an "edge" in work, social life, happiness, and overall personal well-being through improved health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This contrasts with traditional wearables like Whoop, which is often optimized for athletes focusing on strain and recovery, rather than the broader concept of productivity that encompasses sleep, gym, diet, stress levels, sun exposure, and social fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Core Philosophy
A Calm Mind, a Fit Body, and a house full of love cannot be bought; they must be earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Similarly, [[scott_hermans_transition_from_fitness_to_web_3_gaming | fitness]] and mental or physical health cannot be purchased, only earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Web3 Integration and Data Ownership

Pulse integrates a [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology_advancements | Web3]] component primarily by using crypto rails as a transparency mechanism for data brokerage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This addresses the common issue where users of traditional wearables (like Aura or Whoop) are not rewarded for the data they generate, even when companies sell that data for millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Pulse's model allows users to be notified if a third party wishes to acquire their data, giving them the option to review and decide whether to license it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. For example, a research entity like Oxford University could pay participants to acquire a year's worth of wearable and DNA data for clinical studies, with transparency on how the data is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Crypto rails are seen as the solution to problems of transparency, enabling a direct and transparent relationship between research entities and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Data Security and Privacy
Data security is another critical aspect, with plans to store as much data as possible encrypted on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. This ensures that only the user can decrypt their data, providing confidence against hacks and data leakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. The use of fully homomorphic encryption would allow insights to be gained from data without exposing it to third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>, a concept recently highlighted by Apple AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. This approach aims to prevent the large-scale data breaches seen with platforms like 23andMe or Change Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.

Pulse's approach can be summarized as "live to earn," where the value comes from sharing data with third parties for product development, even if the user doesn't actively pursue health optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. The long-term vision includes incentivizing users to contribute a broader range of data, such as blood work, DNA, and electronic health records, to build a more valuable "Health Digital Twin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

## Hardware Development Challenges

Building hardware is extremely difficult, described as "chewing glass that is on fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Unlike software, where updates can quickly fix issues, a single mistake in hardware can require rebuilding from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The Pulse team spent an entire summer in stealth mode, navigating the "gauntlet of production" which involved finding suppliers, testing capabilities, benchmarking, designing, and figuring out logistics and fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. A co-founder even relocated to China full-time to oversee production until the last wearable leaves the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Strategic Advantages of Hardware
Despite the difficulty, building hardware offers several strategic advantages:
*   **Creating a Moat**: It prevents displacement by competitors like Whoop or Oura by controlling access to their own API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Direct Crypto Integration**: The wearable has an NFC chip, allowing direct integration with a crypto wallet for "proof of pulse" â€“ verifying one wallet equals one human without doxing the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This is valuable for teams needing to verify real human users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure for Developers**: Pulse views its wearable as infrastructure, providing an API and SDK for other teams to build software on top of their device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Product Design and Activity Detection

The Pulse team extensively assessed the existing wearable market, analyzing why users chose Whoop, Oura, Ultrahuman Ring, Fitbit, or Apple Watch, and identified flaws and learnings from these solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Pulse's device can glean a surprising amount of information about a person's day-to-day activities using various sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>:
*   **Accelerometer**: Detects acceleration, deceleration, movement, lifting, or putting something down, helping to guess physical exercises like weightlifting or running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
*   **Temperature Sensors**: Indicate if a user is outdoors or indoors (e.g., in hot yoga) by comparing with local temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
*   **Heart Rate**: Provides insights into consistent exercise patterns, like the elevated and consistent heart rate during a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

Pulse aims to automate the detection of about 50 common [[scott_hermans_transition_from_fitness_to_web_3_gaming | fitness]] activities, including swimming, running, boxing, lifting weights, yoga, and Pilates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. It also tracks general lifestyle data, like prolonged sitting or phone use, and can nudge users towards more energetic or productive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

## Growth Strategy and Community Building

Pulse's immediate goal is to build a hardcore fan base of 0 to 10,000 users, primarily from the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This initial phase will focus on refining the app, positioning, branding, and proving the sticky value of Pulse from a productivity and lifestyle perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

The next phase involves scaling from 10,000 to 100,000 users by targeting the "Normy Market" (mainstream retail) through platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Marketing language will shift to resonate with broader audiences, such as busy moms seeking more energy, students wanting to study longer, or high performers aiming for earlier wake-ups and increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Growth strategies will include K or influencer marketing, paid advertising, and performance-based marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Once Pulse achieves a healthy distribution of around 100,000 daily active users, it will explore data acquisition deals, offering companies access to aggregated, anonymized user data from around the world to help them build products more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

### Crypto's Advantage in Community Building
Optimizing productivity has a proven impact on community building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. There's a market desire to pay for an "edge" in life, as seen with online courses promising better health, discipline, or social popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. While individuals cannot directly buy health, they are willing to pay for tools that give them an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

Crypto is considered the most powerful tool for formulating culture within a group, driven by the ownership of tokens and, in Pulse's case, the ownership of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. This fosters community engagement that traditional wearables lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. This unique advantage of leveraging blockchain for community and direct user incentives was a "big aha moment" for Pulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

## Health Optimization Tips

Nix shared practical, underrated tips for optimizing health:
*   **Blackout Curtains**: The easiest low-hanging fruit for improving sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. They help the body regulate sleep cycles more efficiently, preventing premature waking due to early sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   **Exercise**: Many people overlook the importance of regular exercise, over-indexing on dietary details (like microplastics or seed oils) while neglecting physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. Consistent exercise, even a 30-minute run, can significantly improve mood, focus, creativity, and overall well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Enjoying the process of exercise, perhaps through new forms like pickleball, Orange Theory, spin classes, or hot yoga, can make it more sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

## Partnership with Monad

Pulse chose to build on [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology_advancements | Monad]] after a random meeting with Kevin, head of growth at [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology_advancements | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Extensive research into [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology_advancements | Monad]]'s consensus mechanism and throughput capabilities provided confidence in the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.

Pulse's team committed to being fully ingrained in the [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology_advancements | Monad]] ecosystem, quickly engaging with the community and adopting [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology_advancements | Monad]]'s culture and memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. From an infrastructure perspective, [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology_advancements | Monad]]'s focus on speed and low latency aligns with Pulse's need for a smooth user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. The [[monad_labs_and_blockchain_technology_advancements | Monad]] community is already "pilled" on the value of consumer crypto and cares about health, wellness, and optimizing productivity, making it a natural fit for Pulse's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

## Final Alpha

For builders, a key piece of wisdom from Ben Horowitz's book "The Hard Thing About Hard Things" is: "If you're going to eat shit, don't nibble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. This means confronting difficult situations directly and fully, rather than half-measures, which is crucial for founders facing inevitable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

The sentiment surrounding [[crypto_meme_coins | memecoins]] within the venture capital (VC) sector has undergone a significant transformation in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Initially, VCs were observed to be "laughing at mem coins and insulting them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, this perception has shifted as they recognized that the "high FDV low float meta is over and... there's no one to buy these unlocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Challenges Faced by Venture Capitalists

The primary reason for this evolving sentiment stems from the distinct incentives of venture capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. VCs need to raise funds to deploy, and a positive reputation for the crypto industry facilitates discussions with large institutional investors like Larry Fink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Sophisticated actors who manage significant capital are not typically convinced by the "hilarity" or future potential of [[crypto_meme_coins | memecoins]] like Pepe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

It's not necessarily that VCs "hate" [[crypto_meme_coins | memecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, but rather that the prevalence of these assets makes their job harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. When the public discourse is dominated by discussions about "Harry Potter Obama Sonic1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, it becomes challenging for VCs to explain to their Limited Partners (LPs) the legitimacy and long-term potential of emerging technologies within crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The comparison is drawn to a scenario where a platform like ChatGPT, if uncensored, could be overrun with "ridiculous disgusting heinous violent content," overshadowing its core utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Similarly, the permissionless nature of crypto allows for the creation of [[crypto_meme_coins | memecoins]], which, while demonstrating the open aspect, complicates the narrative for those trying to promote the "good aspect" of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Impact on Crypto Industry Perception

The [[the_impact_of_memecoins_on_the_perception_of_the_crypto_industry | impact of memecoins on the perception of the crypto industry]] is significant. The rise of [[crypto_meme_coins | memecoins]] has led to a perception of "financial nihilism," where the entire asset class is viewed as a "scam" or "joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This negative attribution can extend to legitimate projects, making it frustrating for teams building meaningful technologies when the broader industry is dismissed due to the success of [[crypto_meme_coins | memecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Implications for Retail Investors

[[memecoins_as_a_financial_phenomenon_with_implications_for_retail_investors | Memecoins as a financial phenomenon with implications for retail investors]] often result in retail investors "getting cooked" (losing money) due to rampant "low float high FDV" scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Unlike regulated financial markets where companies are required to disclose stock sales by founders, many crypto teams make it difficult to find unlock schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This lack of transparency and incentive alignment is a major issue in the "low float FTV" space, where teams can OTC (over-the-counter) their tokens without being subject to vesting schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

While VCs may not personally dislike [[crypto_meme_coins | memecoins]], the broader narrative they create makes their job of securing serious institutional investment more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

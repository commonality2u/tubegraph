When promoting a business or creating content, a common pitfall is to focus solely on the business itself, detailing features and internal processes. This can be perceived as "me, me, me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. An example is a sandwich shop making a commercial about their organically sourced vegetables and high-quality meats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Shifting from Self-Promotion to Audience Value

Instead of a self-centric approach, businesses can [[creative_content_ideas_for_business_promotion | create content]] that provides value to their audience or viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means thinking about what information or entertainment would benefit the consumer. For instance, the sandwich shop could create a series about the best places to go on a picnic, simply bringing their sandwich along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

This strategy creates a different dynamic with the viewer because the content is actively giving them value, whether through information or entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It showcases different picnic locations, making the content engaging and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## The Product as a Byproduct

In this [[audiencefirst_approach_in_business_marketing | audience-first]] approach, the product itself — such as the sandwich — becomes a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The business can still mention and showcase the product within the valuable content, but its primary focus is on the audience's needs and interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. By positioning content in a way that the audience is prioritized, businesses can more effectively [[targeting_market_audience_with_content | engage their target market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

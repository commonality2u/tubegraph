## Content Creation Tips

### The Importance of Starting

The most crucial piece of advice for anyone new to content creation is to simply "just start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. There are numerous tools available, such as ChatGBT, which eliminate any excuses not to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It's expected to "suck at the beginning" of any new endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The process involves fumbling your way into getting progressively better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Focusing on Incremental Growth

A key strategy for improvement, as advised by successful creators like [[advice_from_successful_creators_like_mr_beast | Mr Beast]], is to focus on getting better by just 1% each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Significant growth in content creation can be achieved by committing to a daily production schedule, even if the content is short and focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For example, creating a "vlog a day" or a "vlog in 60 seconds every single day," with the sole focus on making the next video incrementally better, proved highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Trying to perfect every aspect of your content will significantly slow down your growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Instead, the advice is to move as quickly as possible and work on one small improvement with each iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This approach leads to noticeable and rapid improvement because you are "running full force into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Anom and Kevin, prominent figures on Crypto Twitter, discuss significant events and trends in the crypto market, including the impact of FTX's collapse, the rise of Solana, and the evolving landscape of decentralized applications.

## Anom's Journey and Market Insights

Anom's introduction to crypto began in 2016 during an emerging technologies class at Georgia Tech, where he studied computer science and business, with a focus on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. After graduating and working as a software engineer, he transitioned to full-time crypto trading by mid-2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. His [[growth_and_trends_on_crypto_twitter | Crypto Twitter]] account significantly expanded during the last cycle, growing from approximately 3,000 to over 100,000 followers by sharing his trades publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

In recent months, Anom has observed an "insane" influx of new users, gaining over 30,000 to 35,000 followers in a single month, which he describes as "bull market numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. This rapid market movement, he notes, caught many seasoned traders off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. He attributes this surge to the severe market downturn in 2022, including the collapse of FTX and the Federal Reserve's rate hikes, which pushed down crypto prices even as stocks recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. With crypto still significantly off its highs, the current repricing is happening quickly as new participants enter the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Key Trades and Market Philosophy

Anom highlights Axi Infinity (AXS) as one of his best trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Despite initially viewing the game as a "scam" and being bearish on alts in mid-2021, he was able to "flip bias" and go long on AXS when it started making new highs, even before the broader market flipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. This trade, which saw AXS go from around $12 to over $100, was significant not only for its profit and loss (P&L) but also for demonstrating the importance of adapting one's view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

Anom also emphasizes his successful [[solana_and_blockchain_development | Solana]] trade later that year, where he shifted from Bitcoin to Solana, anticipating a strong rip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. He consistently tracked Solana throughout 2023, confident it would reprice back to pre-FTX levels and gain ground on Ethereum, despite widespread skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

His trading approach combines [[navigating_market_signals_and_identifying_potential_top_signals_in_crypto | price action]] analysis with fundamental understanding, leaning more on price action for actual positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. He diversifies his portfolio, allocating around 70% to projects with strong fundamental theses like [[solana_and_blockchain_development | Solana]], Coinbase, and Bitcoin Prime, and the remaining portion to momentum trades on assets he might not consider fundamentally sound long-term, such as Cardano or Hex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. This strategy acknowledges the power of "social signaling" and speculative premiums in crypto, where projects can reach high valuations due to narrative strength rather than inherent utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>.

Anom stresses the importance of adhering to one's own process and consistently journaling trades to counteract emotional decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. He maintains a long-term bullish stance on crypto, viewing it as fundamentally important and dismissing pessimistic views that it's only for gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Market Perception

The rise of certain projects has led to ingrained biases within the crypto community, with Bitcoin Maxis, for example, often dismissing other projects due to their early success with Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:00">[41:51:00]</a>. Similarly, early Ethereum proponents, who faced criticism from Bitcoin enthusiasts, now sometimes dismiss newer L1s like Solana. This dynamic, driven by past price appreciation, makes it challenging for people to see beyond their initial convictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>.

## Key Market Narratives and the Future of Crypto

### Layer 1 and Layer 2 Competition

The [[crypto_ecosystem_developments | Layer 1 (L1)]] narrative remains strong, exemplified by [[solana_and_blockchain_development | Solana]] and Avalanche (AVAX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>. These L1s offer advantages over Ethereum's mainnet in terms of lower costs, faster speeds, and better user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. Layer 2 (L2) solutions are also a significant narrative, continually working to compete with L1s like Solana on metrics like transactions per second (TPS), user experience, and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>. The EIP-4844 upgrade is expected to make Ethereum rollups significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>.

Users, particularly retail participants, are not loyal to specific chains; they prioritize ease of use and efficient applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>. This competitive landscape will continue to drive innovation in onboarding users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>.

### Early Stages of Mass Adoption

Despite crypto being around since 2009, the infrastructure to support large-scale, consumer-facing applications has only recently become available, notably with [[solana_and_blockchain_development | Solana]] gaining prominence around September 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>. Previously, the internet itself lacked the necessary speed and bandwidth for modern applications like social media. Similarly, true mass adoption for crypto applications requires underlying layers that can handle millions of daily active users and high transaction volumes at low costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>.

Anom believes that as crypto develops more real-world applications and integrates with larger companies (e.g., DePIN projects), it will become easier to distinguish genuine value from purely narrative-driven projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. This current phase is comparable to the early 2000s for tech companies, where significant value emerged over time despite initial failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>.

### Promising Application Areas

#### Apps as "Main Character"

Kevin believes that crypto applications (`apps`) will become the "main character" in the next two years, following the L1 focus of previous cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a>. The first successful apps at scale are expected to have an unprecedented impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>.

#### Payments and Stablecoins

Stablecoins are identified as a massive market with a uniquely enabled solution by crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:00">[32:21:00]</a>. Leveraging the original vision of Bitcoin as peer-to-peer cash, crypto payment rails offer objective advantages over traditional systems like Visa and MasterCard, which charge high fees for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>. Innovations like yield-bearing stablecoins (e.g., Mountain Protocol, Ondo Finance) can make crypto payments superior to traditional options like Venmo by offering T-Bill interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>. The existing adoption of Tether in countries in Africa and South America for everyday payments demonstrates this market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:05:00">[34:05:00]</a>.

#### Social and Gaming

[[social_media_and_community_marketing_in_crypto | Social]] applications hold significant interest due to the potential for better incentive alignment compared to traditional social media, where users are often the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a>.

Gaming is another major area. Drip House on Solana, a free NFT platform allowing artists to release art weekly using compressed NFTs, is a successful example of onboarding new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>. Users often transition from Drip House to other DeFi applications on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:21:00">[31:21:00]</a>.

The challenge lies in overcoming the "Normie perception" that NFTs and crypto are scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:25:00">[36:25:00]</a>. Anom believes a good app, even a "Trojan horse" type that doesn't explicitly highlight its crypto backend, can break through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:36:00">[37:36:00]</a>. Parallel, a gaming project, aims to onboard web2 gamers who can play without needing a crypto address but can opt to own in-game assets as NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:00">[38:01:00]</a>. Free-to-use NFT apps like Drip House also mitigate the "scam" perception by removing financial risk for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>.

Anom's thesis for the upcoming cycle is twofold: continued acceleration of gambling (crypto allows easy betting on anything) and the emergence of applications that display the fundamental value of the space without requiring users to bet money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>. Sports betting through crypto is highlighted as an area where the product is objectively better than web2 alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>.

## Navigating Market Signals and Risks

### Identifying Top Signals

Predicting market tops is becoming increasingly difficult. Last cycle, celebrities like Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen shilled FTX, and its founder interfaced with politicians, yet FTX still collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:56:00">[43:56:00]</a>. This makes it hard to distinguish between traditional "top signals" (e.g., mainstream adoption, non-crypto people shilling) and genuine [[consumer_crypto_and_pulse_overview | mass adoption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>. Anom will primarily rely on technical analysis (TA) to identify false breakouts or parabolic movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:32:00">[45:32:00]</a>.

He acknowledges the irony that market participants bet on crypto for years hoping for mass adoption, only to consider selling when it appears to arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:52:00">[46:52:00]</a>. Recent events like VanEck publishing a Solana report targeting $3,000 during the bear market, Visa writing a report on Solana, and T-Mobile partnering with Helium, suggest that institutional recognition is no longer a top signal but rather a confirmation of underlying value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:34:00">[47:34:00]</a>.

### Preventing Another Luna Event

Anom hopes to avoid another "Luna type event" or similar mechanisms that could lead to easy collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:37:00">[48:37:00]</a>. While leverage-driven liquidations and flash crashes are inherent to crypto, the industry is becoming more cautious with designs. The issues with FTX, stemming from a lack of transparency and poor risk mechanisms, are being addressed by newer exchanges like Cube and Backpack, which prioritize transparency and user fund access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:19:00">[49:19:00]</a>. Many researchers tried to warn about Luna's design flaws, and Anom believes these "smarter voices" will be heeded more this cycle, contributing to [[building_trust_in_the_market_particularly_in_crypto | building trust in the market particularly in crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:10:00">[50:10:00]</a>.

However, the phenomenon of anonymous users raising millions from the public, often by explicitly stating they might "rug it," remains a concern, highlighting the market's current speculative nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:31:00">[50:31:00]</a>.

## Getting Involved in Crypto Safely

Anom suggests the following for new users with no prior trading or software engineering experience:

1.  **Hardware Wallet**: Purchase a hardware wallet (e.g., Trezor, Lattice) to securely store crypto. This is crucial for self-custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:50:00">[54:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Education**: Utilize resources like Coinbase tutorials for new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:36:00">[54:36:00]</a>.
3.  **Community Engagement**: Get active on [[social_media_and_community_marketing_in_crypto | Crypto Twitter]], ideally with a group of friends. This makes digesting vast information easier and provides a support system for questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:22:00">[55:22:00]</a>.
4.  **Hands-on Experience**: Start with a small amount of crypto and experiment with applications. Examples include:
    *   Drip House for free NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:11:00">[56:11:00]</a>.
    *   MarginFi for lending funds and earning yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:18:00">[56:18:00]</a>.
    *   Drift or Zeta for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:30:00">[56:30:00]</a>.
    *   Jupiter for swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>.
    *   Tensor for NFT trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:36:00">[56:36:00]</a>.
5.  **Listen to Founders**: Explore podcasts (like Blockworks) that interview founders, providing insights into their projects' importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:10:00">[57:10:00]</a>.

Kevin reiterates the importance of finding a group of interested peers to navigate the space together, making the experience more engaging and collaborative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:52:00">[57:52:00]</a>.

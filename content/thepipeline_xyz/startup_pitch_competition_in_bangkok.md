*   **Chat Treasuries:** Built into each chat room, allowing token holders to donate and vote on how funds are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Trending Page:** Gauges community activity (new messages, new members) to indicate token longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
Dusted aims to serve the broader tokenized world, projected to be a $15 trillion market by 2027, including RWA assets and prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Revenue streams include in-app trading, customizable experiences (emojis, sticker packs), and sponsored token listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The team reported 287,000 waitlist sign-ups within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### Ever Network
Ever Network is a decentralized healthcare data storage protocol built on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. It addresses the issues of siloed medical records and data breaches by giving data ownership back to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The platform uses an encrypted layer of IPFS, allowing users to control data storage, access, and usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Users can interact with their data via a chatbot and potentially monetize it by licensing it to pharmaceutical companies, insurance providers, and drug researchers, or getting recruited for clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

Starting as a SaaS company in 2019, Ever Network has government contracts with the Thai government and a network of over 650 hospitals and 10 million patient records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. They recently signed a contract with the Indonesian government and are pursuing partnerships in Colombia and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. Their go-to-market strategy is three-pronged: B2B hospital acquisitions, empowering users to earn rewards by providing wearable data (e.g., Aura ring, Whoop, Apple Watch), and leveraging their team's Web3 and global healthcare experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Currently, patient data is managed by hospitals, but Ever Network plans to move towards patient-held private keys in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

### 42
42 is a decentralized AI protocol aiming to solve the scalability limitations of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. They highlight that centralized AI providers face API request limits, and the industry requires trillions of dollars for new infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. 42 leverages the power of small language models (SLMs), like Qwen 2.5, which can run on consumer hardware, combined with the excess compute capacity of regular users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

Their core innovation is "swarm inference," where distributed nodes collaboratively generate responses, peer-reviewing each other and building a "Knowledge Tree" for a compiled answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. This approach aims to lower inference costs by 100x and dramatically improve AI accuracy by avoiding common errors found in state-of-the-art models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. 42 is a research-driven protocol, with a prototype, a research paper presented at MIT's Decentralized AI Summit, and selection for the Monad accelerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. They are preparing to deploy a "foundational hive" of initial nodes to ensure network stability and demonstrate high-quality answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

### G
G is building the economic layer for AI and compute, enabling a new type of on-chain asset backed by real AI cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. They posit that compute is the new currency in the AI era, and GPUs are the underlying asset with high yield potential (100-200% APL, as noted by Jensen Huang) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. The problem is the illiquidity and high friction in accessing GPU assets directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.

G's solution involves tokenizing GPUs and their associated yield on-chain through a transparent and decentralized orchestration layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. They then provide liquidity through DeFi use cases like GPU-backed stablecoins, lending, borrowing, options, and structured products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. Revenue primarily comes from tokenization fees and a cut from tokenized products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. The yield is generated from real AI demand, with a co-founder's company, GMI Cloud, projected to make $100 million in revenue from AI cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. G aims to bring this external yield into crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. They have a pipeline of approximately $2 billion in compute assets to tokenize in the next 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.

### Gifted.art
Gifted.art is an email delivery platform for on-chain goods, aiming to simplify the experience of receiving tokenized assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. The platform addresses the friction points of wallet creation and funding on-ramps that hinder mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. Users can send on-chain goods via email, and recipients log in with their email, with the sender covering initial transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. Gifted.art prides itself on a great mobile-first user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

Clients use Gifted.art for events, digital art e-commerce, and token delivery (e.g., wedding cards, Christmas gifts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. A major activation resulted in a 21% conversion rate from email to new wallet creation, with 7.5% post-claim actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. Their roadmap includes building a suite of on-chain goods like personalized gift cards and scratch cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. The business model charges $1 per email, with additional fees for custom domains and campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. They have bootstrapped to $12K in revenue and 3,000 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

### Jigsaw Finance
Jigsaw Finance is a CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) stablecoin protocol designed to offer maximum capital efficiency and composability over assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. It tackles the limited scope of minting and yield earning in existing CDP stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. Users can deposit ETH, mint JUSD (their stablecoin), and immediately start earning yield through integrated DeFi protocols like Daero (for LST APX ETH) and Pendle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. Users are not locked into their initial deposit and can easily switch between protocols for higher yields or farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

To simplify the complex process, Jigsaw Finance implements an intent-based infrastructure, offering both customized actions and one-click strategies for auto-compounding, claiming, and looping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. The protocol features a dual token system: JUSD as the openly traded stablecoin and Staked JUSD (sJUSD) for earning yields, alongside JIG as a governance token and Staked JIG (sJIG) as a voting token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. The voting system is granular, allowing users to control incentive flows for specific pools and integrations, creating a flywheel effect where increased yield benefits all farmers and attracts more TVL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. Jigsaw Finance prioritizes battle-hardened protocols and conducts its own audits to mitigate the risk of bad debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>.

### Jojo World
Jojo World is a decentralized AI 3D data platform focused on securing and monetizing spatial 3D data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>. It addresses the scarcity and high cost of spatial 3D data, which is crucial for training AI 3D models and large world models (LWMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. The spatial 3D market is projected to reach $1.06 trillion by 2030, with major uses in e-commerce, AR/VR, and spatial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

Jojo World's ecosystem has three layers: creators contribute raw 3D data and receive tokens as incentives; Jojo World processes and supplies this data; and data buyers (e.g., Google, Nvidia, OpenAI) consume tokens to access the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. Their product is live, allowing creators to upload 3D data, and they aim to reach $2 million in revenue by the end of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. The business plan projects $5 billion annually with 5,000 institutional clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. The team has accumulated about 50,000 creators worldwide and partners with top AI companies, including Nvidia and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>. They have collected over 1 million raw spatial 3D datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

### Ky
Ky is the first social media betting app, disrupting the betting industry by allowing users to bet on their favorite creators and influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>. Recognizing the massive attention commanded by social media (billions of monthly active users) and the growth of betting (over half the world participates annually, $1 trillion market by 2030), Ky combines these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

The app, live for YouTube and Twitter creators, allows betting on content engagement (e.g., Donald Trump's tweet views) using paramutual markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. Ky utilizes a two-sided market where players provide liquidity for over/under bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>. In closed alpha, 70% of 200 early customers are active daily, with an average of 250 transactions per user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. Ky aims to be the de facto social media betting product, akin to DraftKings for sports betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>. Future plans include live betting with leverage and social sharing of trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. The team's previous venture was a Solana social media infrastructure company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>. They address bot activity and manipulation through market formation (short time frames, big creators) and real-time monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>.

### LootGo
LootGo is a free "walk-to-earn" mobile app that gamifies daily life into a treasure hunt for meme coins, aiming to onboard non-crypto users seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. It tackles the high barrier to entry and "pay-to-play" nature of many dApps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>. Users simply walk around to collect and open loot boxes containing random meme coins, building their first crypto portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

The treasure hunt is funded by in-app ads, and the excitement of meme coin price surges encourages users to top up and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>. LootGo combines Web2 best practices (move-to-earn, ad revenue) with Web3 rewards (potential upside of tokens) and offers seamless onboarding without worrying about wallets or transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>. Unlike other move-to-earn apps, LootGo is a platform for accessing speculative assets, not speculative itself, offering diversification and higher retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>. The team targets the trillion-dollar speculation market, starting with crypto-native communities, then expanding to crypto-aware and non-crypto users via referrals and mass marketing (e.g., TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>. The main business model relies on trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.

### M10
M10 is a next-gen video game publisher and developer, building a new type of shooter game for the "brain rot era" characterized by a constant need for dopamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:46">[01:27:46]</a>. Their first game, "Project Fallen," is a 1v1 competitive shooter where players control multiple squads and can rapidly hot-swap between them in third-person view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>. Matches are short, intense 10-minute sessions with no boring moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>. M10 positions "Project Fallen" as a "Helldivers 2 but PVP," tapping into the PVP market which is five times larger than PVE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>. Playtesting has shown overwhelmingly positive feedback, with hot-swapping identified as the most unique feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a>.

M10 aims to turn the game into a player's obsession through a deep, player-driven economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:58">[01:29:58]</a>. The best in-game items are earned through competitive play, creating a zero-sum system where players can also buy from top-ranked players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. They also emphasize a robust UGC (User-Generated Content) cosmetic system, where players create and sell cosmetics, taking most of the revenue, unlike traditional games with high take rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>. Their business model is "in-app taxation": M10 doesn't sell anything directly to players, but instead takes a tax from player-to-player trades within the vibrant economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>. This model is expected to increase monetization and conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:43">[01:31:43]</a>. The team boasts experienced leaders, including a former CEO of a $200M gaming company and a game director from Assassin's Creed Origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>.

### Monart
Monart is an IP powerhouse that transforms crypto IPs into consumer products for mainstream adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:47">[01:36:47]</a>. They focus on designing, manufacturing, and distributing these products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:57">[01:36:57]</a>. Inspired by companies like Pop Mart, which sells emotional value toys at high margins and repurchase rates, Monart identifies a gap in Web3 for IP derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:21">[01:37:21]</a>. While Pudgy Penguins have shown success with physical toys through traditional channels, Monart aims to leverage verifiable on-chain IPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:26">[01:38:26]</a>.

Monart's core product involves finding the best crypto IPs, turning them into mystery boxes, and shipping them to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>. Customers can buy these mystery boxes on-chain via their website or Telegram mini-apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>. The "blind box" mechanism allows for trading before opening, and rare items carry a premium, generating marketplace fees for Monart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. They also plan to sell through traditional Web2 channels like TikTok live streaming, aiming to convert Web2 users to Web3 one at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:25">[01:39:25]</a>. The protocol requires a high-throughput blockchain like Monad to handle transactions and ensure transparency and fairness, protecting against MEV hunters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. Monart will start with its original Momo IP, followed by pop-up and in-person stores, and integrate other IPs on-chain by Q3 next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:38">[01:40:38]</a>.

### Monorail
Monorail is building an "instant personalized order book" that combines the best of order books and AMMs (Automated Market Makers) to optimize the trading experience on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>. It addresses the inefficiencies of traditional order books (struggle with long-tail tokens, less resilient to liquidity gaps) and AMMs (lack pricing precision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:37">[01:45:37]</a>. Users can trade any on-chain asset (whether on order book or AMM) under one roof, benefiting from smart order routing that taps into all available liquidity sources for best prices and deepest liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:23">[01:46:23]</a>.

Monorail supports advanced order types like limit orders and partial fills, abstracting away fragmentation and complexity for a seamless user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>. Even without live on-chain order books, they claim to provide comparable or better pricing 81% of the time against competitors like 1inch and Matcha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>. Unlike traditional aggregators, Monorail was built from the ground up for seamless AMM and order book integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:24">[01:47:24]</a>. As a Monad-native project, they commit to working with every team to ensure no liquidity is left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:37">[01:47:37]</a>. Their revenue model includes a 0.1-0.2% fee on transactions and an affiliate fee model to incentivize integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:51">[01:47:51]</a>. The future vision includes bridge aggregation and market aggregation to become a central hub for DeFi insights and action on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:33">[01:48:33]</a>. The team previously built Astroport, the largest AMM on Terra, managing over $2 billion in TVL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:06">[01:49:06]</a>.

### Moosy
Moosy is an infrastructure for a lossless crypto experience, powered by yield-bearing assets, designed to make staking more engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. It addresses the issues of locked funds, passive experience, and missed opportunities in traditional staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:03">[01:55:03]</a>. Moosy aims to keep users' principal safe, maximize yield, and provide fun through interactive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:15">[01:55:15]</a>.

The process involves four steps: stake Monad, take LST (Liquid Staking Token), enjoy by utilizing LST in the Moosy ecosystem, and profit from opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Moosy collects yield for Monad every epoch, and users can enjoy it every two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:22">[01:56:22]</a>. The platform supports any LST and is open for developers to build on top of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:32">[01:56:32]</a>. Use cases include games (Magic Wheel, rock-paper-scissors), financial tools (binary options, leveraged yield trading), social applications, and payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:51">[01:56:51]</a>. The revenue model comes from a 0.1% fee on transactions and commission fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>. The LST market opportunity is over $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:07">[01:58:07]</a>. Moosy's go-to-market strategy focuses on community building, LST partnerships, and launching key product features on platforms like Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>. The vision is to unlock sustainable growth and flexibility for users, developers, and the Monad blockchain by allowing users to play games and engage only with the yield, protecting their principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:53">[01:58:53]</a>.

### Moo Digital
Moo Digital is bringing Blue Chip borrowers on-chain by building an RWA (Real World Asset) protocol that provides access to institutional-grade, high-yield corporate lending directly from an on-chain wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:44">[02:02:44]</a>. They aim to solve the "RWA trilemma" of simultaneously achieving liquidity, high returns, and stability, which traditional tokenized treasuries or illiquid credit lending protocols struggle with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:35">[02:03:35]</a>.

Users can swap stablecoins for Moo Digital's muon tokens to access yields averaging 10-12% from corporate borrowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:44">[02:04:44]</a>. The protocol is built for DeFi, offering permissionless transfers, 24/7 mint/redeem, and composability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:51">[02:04:51]</a>. It simplifies access barriers like KYC, high minimums, and credit analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. The portfolio is backed by high-grade public credit (bonds yielding 1-5% over US treasuries) and proprietary private credit deals (co-underwritten with investment banks, yielding 15-20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:25">[02:05:25]</a>. Moo Digital's competitive advantage lies in its focus on tokenizing APAC corporate lending, a $20 trillion market offering premium yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:52">[02:05:52]</a>. Their "secret sauce" is in asset origination and credit underwriting expertise, leveraging their team's careers in TradFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:07">[02:06:07]</a>. The go-to-market strategy is B2B-focused, targeting foundations, DAOs, and DeFi natives, with an eight-figure TVL commitment book ahead of launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:40">[02:06:40]</a>.

### Paper Plane
Paper Plane is a lifestyle app that changes how people eat, drink, and earn rewards, aiming to connect Web2 users with Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:07">[02:12:07]</a>. The platform addresses the issue of untraceable advertisement spending by rewarding merchants and consumers for uploading user data on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:32">[02:12:32]</a>. It onboards young users with high lifetime value and an openness to new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:21">[02:13:21]</a>.

Paper Plane allows Web3 projects (e.g., centralized exchanges) to roll out payment solutions and tokens to real-world users for dining and partying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:31">[02:13:31]</a>. For consumers, it offers discounts when paying with crypto at premium venues like Michelin Star restaurants and world's best bars in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:57">[02:13:57]</a>. The "magic" lies in users seeing their purchasing power grow as tokens appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:31">[02:14:31]</a>. They have onboarded 100+ premium venues and 10K+ users, collaborating with a top crypto exchange in Taiwan and a luxury automobile brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:52">[02:14:52]</a>. The go-to-market is a flywheel: more brands lead to more campaigns/rewards, attracting more users, which brings more merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>. Discounts for crypto payments come from marketing fees paid by Web2 brands and savings from credit card fees (2-3%), combining to offer 8-12% cashback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:22">[02:18:22]</a>.

### Primus
Primus (formerly Parallax) is a cryptography technology provider focused on making Web2 data usable on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:43">[02:21:43]</a>. It aims to solve the problem of limited on-chain data (only transactions, addresses, balances) and the complexity of integrating Web2 data using cryptography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>. Primus builds a cryptographic layer for secure data intelligence, connecting authenticated, high-value data from Web2 to Web3 and AI applications in a trustless and secure way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:03">[02:23:03]</a>.

They provide two core capabilities: data verification and data computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:22">[02:23:22]</a>. Their core technologies include MPC TLS (Multi-Party Computation Transport Layer Security), ZK TLS (Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security), and ZK FHE (Zero-Knowledge Fully Homomorphic Encryption) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:30">[02:23:30]</a>. Primus's ZK TLS is 10 times faster than existing solutions, and their ZK FHE design offers a 300x improvement in proving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. In the short term, they focus on providing data verification capabilities, offering standard protocols for digital goods marketplaces, verifiable data marketplaces, and prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:47">[02:24:47]</a>. They plan to open-source their development to promote community adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:09">[02:25:09]</a>. The long-term goal is to deploy FHE payments and FHE VMs for confidential AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:24">[02:25:24]</a>. The team consists of 16 members, including a chief cryptographer whose algorithms are used in other products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:32">[02:25:32]</a>.

### Pulse
Pulse is building a DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) that monetizes health data through its own native wearables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:23">[02:30:23]</a>. It addresses the issue of large companies profiting from users' health data without compensating the data generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:50">[02:31:50]</a>. Pulse aggregates health data from various devices (wearables, DNA, blood work, health records), encrypts it on-chain, and allows users to share it with third parties in return for rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:59">[02:31:59]</a>.

The health data market is valued at $69 billion and is projected to reach $540 billion in the next decade, fueled by AI, longevity research, and personalized healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:13">[02:32:13]</a>. Pulse aims to build a health data ecosystem, allowing data owners to share data with researchers, health apps, or marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:54">[02:32:54]</a>. A key component is their consumer application, serving as a gateway for data contribution and providing health insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:50">[02:33:50]</a>. They also offer a native wearable device, the "Pulse," marketed for productivity hackers, tracking sleep, heart rate, calories, and energy levels to provide recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:11">[02:34:11]</a>. The device has an inbuilt hardware wallet with a secure enclave for private key creation, ensuring only the user has access to their encrypted data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:48">[02:34:48]</a>. Pulse is decentralized from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:14">[02:35:14]</a>. The team has seen early success, with $150K in sales in 21 days, selling out multiple waves of their product, primarily to the Monad crypto-native community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:23">[02:35:23]</a>. Future plans include scaling to a broader audience via TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, targeting fitness and productivity segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:31">[02:37:31]</a>.

### Pi Finance
Pi Finance is building liquid stake bonds (LSBs) and a yield exchange, a new DeFi primitive to access the massive staking market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:19">[02:41:19]</a>. With a staking market cap of $750 billion and an average 6.7% APY for Proof-of-Stake networks, approximately $49 billion in staking rewards are set to be unlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:42">[02:40:42]</a>.

LSBs allow users to deposit Monad via a time-lock (e.g., 3, 6, 9, 12 months) into an LST or a chosen validator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">[02:42:04]</a>. Users can then mint two types of tokens: "P-Monad" (a Monad stablecoin pegged 1:1) and "Y-Monad" (representing the yield generated during the term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:41">[02:42:41]</a>. Both are tradable on-chain and composable in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:59">[02:42:59]</a>. The trading mechanism is an escrow-like marketplace (ERC-1155 tokens), allowing peer-to-peer trading focused on maturity dates and discount to spot, enabling users to buy assets cheaper or get cash upfront for future yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:06">[02:43:06]</a>. Revenue comes from 25 basis points on total deposits and 15 basis points per trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:24">[02:43:24]</a>. The go-to-market strategy involves partnering with LSTs/operators to bring TVL and launching a points program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:53">[02:43:53]</a>. Pi Finance differentiates itself from Pendle by focusing on the validator/staking layer rather than DeFi LSTs and points, targeting institutional and retail stakers, and OTC desks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:31">[02:44:31]</a>. The team has raised over $800K in pre-seed funding and secured $25 million in TVL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:16">[02:45:16]</a>. They won a Solana hackathon in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:28">[02:45:28]</a>.

### Rare Bet Sports
Rare Bet Sports is a sports betting app combining sports betting with a "Tinder-like" swipe-to-pick UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:51">[02:47:51]</a>. It identifies the vast difference between people who gamble (4.8 billion annually) and those who invest in traditional stocks (500 million), suggesting a need for more accessible betting platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:21">[02:48:21]</a>. The team leverages their backgrounds in Web3, Web2 giants (Nike, Twitch), sports media, and meme culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:52">[02:48:52]</a>.

Their inaugural product, "Rlink," is based on the proven Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) framework, complying with the UIGEA carveout for games of skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>. Participants select over/under on 2-7 player props with a swipe-to-pick UX and can win up to 100x their entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:07">[02:51:07]</a>. Win or lose, players accumulate tickets for daily and season-ending prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:14">[02:51:14]</a>. The team built the "RBS Oracle" to bring verifiable player prop data on-chain from Web2 sources like Sports Data IO (used by tier-one sportsbooks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>. The Oracle's API will be available for other Monad or EVM projects needing on-chain sports data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:02">[02:52:02]</a>. Rlink lowers customer acquisition costs and provides utility across crypto through infrastructure and community partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:23">[02:52:23]</a>. It targets both Web2 and Web3 consumers with seamless onboarding via email and social logins, abstracting away blockchain complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:53">[02:52:53]</a>. Their go-to-market is Web3-focused, partnering with 10+ NFT and token communities for revenue sharing and boosted payouts for holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:19">[02:56:19]</a>.

### Score
Score Technologies is building "Moneyball for the World of Sports," starting with football (soccer), aiming to make elite-level analytics accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:08">[02:58:08]</a>. They address the shocking reality that 98% of football clubs worldwide cannot access or utilize the vast amounts of data generated, leading to an estimated $30 billion in missed value annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:26">[02:58:26]</a>. Score's solution involves AI models that watch games, extract all data, and combine it with traditional stats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>.

They run the first decentralized network of football intelligence, with over 200 AI models competing to provide insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:21">[02:59:21]</a>. Fans contribute by creating new data using Score-powered apps, teaching machines about the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:36">[02:59:36]</a>. Use cases include finding new talent (the "next Ronaldo"), coaches predicting tactical shifts, physiotherapists preventing injuries, media companies creating automated content, and game designers building realistic simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:48">[02:59:48]</a>. Their technology provides insights at a fraction of traditional costs, making it affordable globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:20">[03:00:20]</a>. A single football match generates a million data points, necessitating speed and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:34">[03:00:34]</a>. The game plan involves open-sourcing models (like GitHub for football intelligence), ingesting 200,000 games per week, onboarding major sports organizations as customers, and opening APIs for anyone to build the future of football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:48">[03:00:48]</a>. The team comprises Web3 OGs and football insiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:23">[03:01:23]</a>. They have partnerships, including one with Harry Kane for his Cleat Club app, and are generating $150K monthly from their subnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:46">[03:01:46]</a>.

### Sendspace
Sendspace is a "judgment-free" social platform for unlocking genuine human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:42">[03:06:42]</a>. It addresses the issues of social metrics (follower counts) and curated personal brands that hinder authentic interaction in today's digital world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:50">[03:06:50]</a>. Sendspace aims to provide a platform for "real chats without the baggage," abstracting away quantitative context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:33">[03:07:33]</a>.

Users log in with an Aura wallet (to abstract from existing on-chain activity), create a pseudonymous avatar, match with others based on interests, and have a five-minute conversation that disappears afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:43">[03:07:43]</a>. After the conversation, users are awarded "send tokens" (an in-app token) to purchase "auras" – on-chain attestations of "Good Vibes" for positive interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:14">[03:08:14]</a>. The alpha version launched as a PWA about a week ago, and they are testing with on-chain communities and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:27">[03:08:27]</a>. A native app for app stores is planned for early next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:46">[03:08:46]</a>. While focused on value accrual in the near term, long-term commercialization opportunities include leveraging their unique "Good Vibes" social graph and increased utility for the "send" token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:03">[03:09:03]</a>. The Tokyo-based team has been building on-chain games and apps for two years, with a recent focus on Farcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:16">[03:09:16]</a>. For content moderation, they implement a "three strikes policy," a report button, and a rating system that doesn't impact rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:49">[03:11:49]</a>.

### Sky Trade
Sky Trade is a marketplace that aims to secure and monetize airspace, specifically focusing on the fact that in jurisdictions like the US and UK, landowners own the airspace up to 500 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:49">[03:14:49]</a>. This untapped asset can be a source of passive income for landowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>.

On their platform, landowners can register their airspace, undergo KYC, and monetize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:25">[03:15:25]</a>. Real estate owners can view and buy air rights for their buildings or neighboring areas to increase building flows or preserve balcony views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:36">[03:15:36]</a>. Another use case is for the drone industry: drone owners often face issues flying above 400 feet due to private airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:55">[03:15:55]</a>. They can rent tokenized airspaces through Sky Trade for legal flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:09">[03:16:09]</a>. Sky Trade is live on Solana, and tokens are minted there, but they plan to scale and migrate to other EVM-compatible blockchains like Monad for faster speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:31">[03:16:31]</a>. The business model involves charging commissions on air rights rentals and sales, and offering priced APIs for landowners to monitor their airspaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:28">[03:17:28]</a>. They have partnerships with local governments (e.g., Utah Department of Transport to monetize highway airspace), real estate companies, Safe Helipads (drone infrastructure), and Partial.Lives (real estate data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:51">[03:17:51]</a>.

### Spark
Spark, by Opti Games, is an "adrenaline-packed" sports brawler game designed for player well-being, aiming for players to be happier after playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:08">[03:23:08]</a>. The game is described as "League of Legends meets Rocket League or FIFA, but you kill each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:19">[03:24:19]</a>. Players choose a hero with unique abilities to score in the enemy goal, balancing team fighting and objective play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:24">[03:24:24]</a>.

Spark Ball is fully playable, and an open event saw 5,000 players engage without financial incentives, with 9.6/10 rating for post-game happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:51">[03:24:51]</a>. A key part of the experience is its whimsical IP, "Sparkadia," an optimistic world where players can become citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:13">[03:25:13]</a>. Sparkadia's IP is architected by talents from League of Legends and Arcane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:27">[03:25:27]</a>. Season Zero, a large open play event, was launching, introducing Web3-enabled platform "Sparkadia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:48">[03:25:48]</a>. Spark distinguishes "Spark Ball" (the game) from its Web3 "companion apps," which offer different ways to engage (e.g., fantasy Spark Ball where players open card packs, build fantasy teams, and wager on AI vs. AI matches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:08">[03:26:08]</a>. Sparkadia acts as the governing body (like FIFA/UEFA) over these companion apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:33">[03:26:33]</a>. This distinction allows publishing on major platforms like Steam and secured full approval and investment from Microsoft to build on Xbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:50">[03:26:50]</a>.

### Talentum
Talentum is a tool for user acquisition in Web3, unifying users' Web3 and Web2 data credentials to create a powerful tool for targeting skilled, on-chain verified users in a creator economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:43">[03:31:43]</a>. It addresses the challenges of fragmented on-chain data and ignored Web2 data in Web3 targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:01">[03:32:01]</a>.

The process involves four steps: onboarding users with rewarding activities, engaging them with visible results, evaluating their contributions, and dividing them into groups, allowing projects to find appropriate users easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:31">[03:32:31]</a>. Talentum is live and has achieved proven traction, with over 8,000 active "talents" and 800 "Q KOLs" (Key Opinion Leaders), reaching over 15 million users worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:18">[03:33:18]</a>. They have generated over $100K in revenue and launched over 20 top Web3 projects, securing grants from Aurora and DeFi Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:42">[03:33:42]</a>. A case study with Wild Forest showed over 80% user engagement boost and over 1 million YouTube views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:55">[03:33:55]</a>. Revenue streams include premium access for talents, transaction fees, promotion plans, and fees for running campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:20">[03:34:20]</a>. The Web3 service market is projected to reach $177 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:48">[03:34:48]</a>. Talentum sees Monad as a perfect match due to its growing community, low gas fees, and fast transactions, which are crucial for handling large amounts of real-time data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:05">[03:35:05]</a>. Future innovations include digital identity (pulling data from user profiles for targeting) and an AI agent for campaign management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:18">[03:35:18]</a>. The self-funded project has invested $500K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:54">[03:35:54]</a>.

### Toten
Toten is the first AI DePIN network designed to unlock the value of daily conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:53">[03:39:53]</a>. It aims to solve the problem of fragmented tools failing to capture, process, and monetize voice data, as well as privacy concerns limiting participation in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:51">[03:40:51]</a>. Unlike competitors focusing on low-value browser data, Toten targets the voice data market, estimated at over $100 billion, with specific sectors like voice data monetization ($24B) and language services ($65B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:23">[03:40:23]</a>.

Toten provides a comprehensive solution: a physical device that attaches to a phone, capturing voice data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>. This data is converted into real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, then encrypted using Zero-Knowledge Proofs to become anonymized data sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:20">[03:41:20]</a>. Users can upload this data on-chain via Monad's fast throughput to exchange for tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:35">[03:41:35]</a>. The hardware is designed by an Apple expert, featuring an acceleration chip and dual audio capture, backed by a robust Chinese supply chain for cost-effective, scalable production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:47">[03:41:47]</a>. The app leverages AI models from Meta (Llama), Google (Gemini), and Alibaba for optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:32">[03:42:32]</a>. The monetization model covers B2B and B2C: device retail ($199), subscription services for premium features, and selling anonymized data sets to AI companies for model training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:58">[03:42:58]</a>. Go-to-market strategies target traditional customers (direct-to-consumer via website, Amazon, Best Buy) and crypto-native users (Monad ecosystem, cross-culture events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:24">[03:43:24]</a>. The reward system incentivizes purchases, referrals, and content contributions, allowing users to access product sales and premium services, or stake tokens for benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:05">[03:44:05]</a>. The team has expertise in NLP, software (Google Pixel), and supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:26">[03:44:26]</a>. Users have an opt-in/opt-out option for data recording, ensuring data control and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:08">[03:47:08]</a>.

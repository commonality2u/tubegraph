The [[ronin_blockchain_company_hack | Ronin blockchain company hack]] is considered one of the largest in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, resulting in approximately half a billion dollars in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Background

Ronin, a blockchain company, developed a popular game called Axie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its parent company was Sky Mavis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Attack Vector

The hack originated when a Devops Engineer at Sky Mavis was [[social_engineering_and_phishing_attack | fished]] with a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The engineer clicked on an executable file, which was the initial point of compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Exploiting Multi-sig Vulnerability

A critical point of failure was that one person's device had access to four keys for a multi-signature (multi-sig) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A multi-sig is like a door requiring multiple keys to unlock it; in this case, five out of nine total key holes were needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Through [[social_engineering_and_phishing_attack | social engineering]], attackers initially gained control of four of these keys from the compromised engineer's device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They then performed lateral movement, moving from the compromised device to another, to acquire the fifth necessary key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. With all five keys, they were able to compromise the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Scale and Impact

This hack, stemming from a seemingly innocuous office email, led to a substantial loss of approximately half a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> and exploited TBL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

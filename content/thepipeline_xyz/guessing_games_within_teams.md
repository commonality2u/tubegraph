An example of a guessing game played within teams involves participants attempting to identify specific names or words based on prompts or clues given by teammates or a host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Gameplay Mechanics

*   **Guessing Rounds**
    The game proceeds with players or teams making guesses, with reactions such as "that was weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> or "I don't know that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> indicating uncertainty or an incorrect guess.
*   **Feedback**
    Successful guesses are met with positive reinforcement, such as "good job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> or "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, when the correct answer is provided or deduced.
*   **Skipping**
    A "skip" mechanism allows players or teams to pass on a difficult item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This feature is common in [[challenges_and_tasks_in_degenerate_game_shows | challenges and tasks]] that involve rapid-fire responses.
*   **Repetition and Prompts**
    Prompts like "again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> and "do again again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> suggest that clues or opportunities to guess may be repeated or rephrased.

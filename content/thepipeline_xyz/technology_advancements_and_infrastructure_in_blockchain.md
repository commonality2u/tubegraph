The evolution of [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | blockchain technology]] has been significantly driven by continuous advancements in its underlying infrastructure, aiming to enhance performance, scalability, and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This article explores the importance of robust infrastructure, key innovations, and the collaborative efforts driving the [[evolution_and_impact_of_highperformance_blockchain_technology | high-performance blockchain technology]] landscape.

## Collaboration Between Monad and Pith

Mike Cahill, CEO of Doro Labs and Pith contributor, highlights a strong collaborative relationship between Monad and Pith, stemming from a shared focus on the intersection of finance and [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Both entities prioritize optimizations that require significant "hard tech" and a relentless pursuit of efficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This drive attracts individuals from systematic trading backgrounds, emphasizing the growing need for efficient infrastructure as valuable assets begin transacting on blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

Keone, CEO of Monad Labs, reinforces this synergy, citing shared values like decentralization and community as core drivers of their collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Blockchain Infrastructure
Early generations of blockchains served as proofs of concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Breakthroughs, such as Solana's fast block times, set new industry standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Layer 2 solutions have since brought Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to these performance attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Monad is particularly exciting because it aims to offer similar synergistic opportunities found on platforms like Solana, but within an EVM layer, leveraging the existing EVM community ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. This focus on performance is expected given the background of its founders from high-frequency trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## Pith Network: A Universal Data Primitive

Pith's mission is to establish a "source of truth at t0," constantly striving for the most accurate and immediate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. It aims to build a "Universal data primitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

### Differentiating from Traditional Oracles
Unlike many other "Oracles" that act as messaging protocols (e.g., Chainlink, Switchboard), fetching data from the internet via automation nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[28:50:00]</a>, Pith creates a singular source that data owners are incentivized to publish to directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. This approach borrows from trading infrastructure setups, aiming for predictive value at time t0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

### Addressing the Changing Internet Business Model
Cahill notes a trend where data, once openly available (driven by Google's advertising model), is increasingly moving behind paywalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. Large Language Models (LLMs) further exacerbate this by not routing traffic or providing citations, limiting the open internet's ability to source data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. Pith addresses this by incentivizing data owners to publish their "paywall data" to its source, creating a powerful economic model that provides compensation for valuable data without relying on advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. This direct sourcing means data is received directly from its creator, reducing latency and bringing it closer to the "t0" goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

## Impact on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and End-Users

Pith aims to provide applications and users with equal access to the same level of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. Its application blockchain, PithNet, aggregates data from 100 publishers for 400 symbols, updating multiple times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>. This data is then accessible to 50 connected blockchains and approximately 300 applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>.

For an end-user on a perpetual exchange (per Dex) on Monad, Pith provides constantly updating price data directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. When a user executes a trade, the price is pulled onto the local chain, ensuring a bonafide, transparent transaction on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. A small fee collected for each data delivery is then distributed to the data contributors, ensuring a sustainable business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>. This protects against the risk of data sources being shut off due to unauthorized scraping, a common concern in the $7 billion real-time financial market data industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

### High-Performance Oracles in DeFi
High-fidelity oracles are crucial for various DeFi primitives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>.
*   **Lending Protocols:** They require precise pricing to maintain the safety of vaults and prevent issues like liquidations or negative value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. Accurate, aggregated price sources that consider confidence intervals are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>.
*   **Derivatives Contracts:** These contracts rely on accurate pricing for settlement, and perpetuals, in particular, need highly accurate mark prices for funding rate calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:35:00">[24:35:00]</a>.

Currently, centralized exchanges often have lower execution costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>. Greater efficiency on the DeFi side, supported by accurate and up-to-date pricing from high-performance oracles like Pith, is necessary for DeFi to compete effectively with centralized finance and potentially "eat the rest of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>.

## Institutional Adoption and Community Growth

Pith's model encourages large financial institutions, including major trading firms (e.g., Jane Street, Susquehanna, Virtu, DRW) and exchanges (e.g., Cboe), to become publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. These firms possess vast amounts of data, previously used mainly for internal model training, which Pith allows them to commercialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. This engagement forces institutions to learn and adapt to blockchain mechanics, such as submitting data on-chain and understanding tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. This represents a significant milestone, lowering the bar for future institutional involvement in [[future_developments_in_crypto_and_blockchain_technology | blockchain technology]], such as asset custody or on-chain trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>.

Pith launched its token with a retrospective airdrop in November, involving 27 blockchains and approximately 100,000 eligible wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:10:00">[37:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:22:00">[37:22:00]</a>. The initiative aimed to decentralize governance and engage users in the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[37:34:00]</a>. Currently, over 110,000 wallets are staking in the Pith protocol, demonstrating strong community belief and participation in decentralized infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:00">[37:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a>. This number is significantly higher than many established DeFi protocols, such as Aave (15,000 wallets), GMX (20,000), and Synthetix (40,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>.

## Importance of Infrastructure for Future Growth

Mike Cahill emphasizes that [[importance_of_technology_and_scalability_in_blockchain_ecosystems | infrastructure is the most important]] aspect of technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>. He likens it to the development of the iPhone preceding applications like Uber; fundamental infrastructure must be in place before "killer apps" can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a>. This aligns with Amara's Law, where people tend to overestimate short-term technological impacts while underestimating long-term ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>.

The [[challenges_and_advancements_in_highfrequency_trading_and_blockchain | ongoing improvements in blockchain infrastructure]] are leading to an "overnight success factor" similar to historical innovations like railroads, electricity, or the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:52:00">[42:52:00]</a>. Despite periods of perceived stagnation, foundational work continues beneath the surface, preparing for significant future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:45:00">[43:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>. This focus on building better infrastructure promises to [[challenges_and_propositions_in_blockchain_technology | unlock new possibilities]] and lead to a more efficient, accessible, and inclusive financial system globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:00]</a>.

For [[role_of_leadership_in_startups | early stage Founders]], the concept of leadership is initially "completely out of question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A founder's primary role is to do "literally everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This counterintuitive approach emphasizes the necessity of being a "great soldier" first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Role of the "Great Soldier" Founder

In the initial stages of a startup, founders must take on all responsibilities themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This includes:
*   Coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Even cleaning their own chairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Dealing with lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Handling accountants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

The advice is to "be a great Soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, meaning to gain extensive hands-on experience fighting "a lot of battles on ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> before hiring others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This direct experience teaches founders how to effectively hire "great soldiers" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Transitioning to Leadership

The greatest founders who eventually became leaders did so precisely because they were first great soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. There is a specific [[transition_from_founder_to_leader | transition period]] where a founder grows into the role of a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While support for leaders is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, there is "hardly any support for people who want to become great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

A "great warrior" is poised to become a great leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Conversely, a leader who has never been on the ground fighting battles is "not very great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

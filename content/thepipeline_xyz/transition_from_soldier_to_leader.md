For [[early_stage_founders_and_leadership | early stage founders]], the concept of leadership is initially "out of question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Their primary focus is on intense, hands-on execution, acting as "soldiers" in the trenches.

## The Founder as a Soldier

The job of an [[early_stage_founders_and_leadership | early stage founder]] is to "do literally everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This involves a wide range of tasks:
*   Coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Even cleaning their own chairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Dealing with lawyers and accountants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

"Absolutely everything has to be done by the founders initially" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The advice given is to "be a great soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, fighting "a lot of battles on ground" before hiring others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

> "My advice super [[counterintuitive_nature_of_leadership_development | counterintuitive]] is be a great soldier, become such a great soldier that you can fight a lot of battles on ground before you hire soldiers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

## Importance of Hands-On Experience

The greatest founders who eventually became leaders did so because they were "great soldiers" first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This [[importance_of_handson_experience_for_leaders | hands-on experience]] is crucial because it teaches founders "how to hire great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. A leader who has "never been on the ground fighting those battles" is considered "not very great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The belief is that "a great warrior would become a great leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Transition Period

After gaining significant on-the-ground experience, there will be a "transition period where you become a leader or grow into the role of a leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While there is ample support available for those transitioning into leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, there is less support for individuals aiming to become "great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. There's an active effort to cultivate "greatest of soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

This article explores various [[hypothetical_scenarios_involving_the_monad_community | hypothetical scenarios involving the Monad community]] and general hypotheticals posed during a discussion.

## Explaining Monad

When asked, "how would you [[explaining_manad_to_a_child | explain Manad to a 5-year-old]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, the response was "very fast give me some nice ASMR water in fast give me some nice ASMR water in here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The same question was later answered with "Goooo Gaga" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Imaginary Community Scenarios

*   **Monad Animals' Band Name**: If the Monad animals had a band, their name would be "Mal the Mandos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The favorite Monad animal is Milando <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Dream App**: If one could have one [[imagining_dreams_as_alternate_realities | dream app]] on Monad, it would be an app to order Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Community Purge**: If forced to "purge one person from the Manad community," the choice would be "Tunes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Personal Hypotheticals

*   **Choice of Opponent**: Faced with fighting "a thousand mooches or one giant land," the preference would be to fight "a thousand mooches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, as there is already a "giant m landok in my home right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Alternative Career**: If not involved in crypto, the individual would "be flipping burgers at Wendy's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Creating a game is considered more challenging than developing an on-chain game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The primary obstacle in gaming development is the creation of a good game itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Prioritizing Fun and Quality

The recommended approach is to first create a fun game, and only then consider integrating on-chain components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This strategy prioritizes the gameplay experience over blockchain features.

For instance, a platform like Roblox, which was established first, would make sense with the later addition of NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Existing In-Game Economies

Despite the inherent risks, gray markets for in-game assets have existed for a long time, demonstrating a demand for asset trading within established games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Examples include:
*   Gamers trading CS:GO skins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   The RuneScape gray market for gold, which has been active for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

These users often face scams, resorting to insecure methods like wire transfers to anonymous individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This highlights that demand for in-game trading can exist even without secure, on-chain solutions, reinforcing the idea that a compelling game experience is the foundational element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Verifying crypto transaction addresses is crucial for [[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | user security in cryptocurrency]] and to prevent financial losses in the realm of [[navigating_risk_and_security_in_crypto_investments | crypto investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. A significant threat to be aware of is [[common_cryptocurrency_scams | address poisoning attacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Address Poisoning Attacks

Address poisoning is a [[common_attack_vectors_in_crypto | common attack vector]] where an attacker monitors a user's transaction ledger, such as an EtherScan history, for incoming transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Through [[crypto_transaction_monitoring | transaction monitoring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, the attacker can immediately send a small transaction to the user using an address that looks very similar to one of the user's previously used addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### How the Scam Works
The scam relies on visual deception:
*   Attackers can create addresses where the first and last characters are extremely close to a legitimate address, for example, `0x11...563FD` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   Often, the middle characters of the address are not fully visible in a browser or transaction history view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   If a user is not paying close attention, they might mistakenly copy the attacker's similar-looking address from their transaction history, believing it to be a correct wallet address they intend to send funds to, perhaps even between their own wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This can lead to accidentally sending a large amount of money to the attacker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. People have lost significant sums of money due to this scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Precautions

To avoid falling victim to address poisoning and ensure [[precautions_when_copying_wallet_addresses | precautions when copying wallet addresses]]:
*   Always use the direct source when copying and pasting a crypto address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   If copying from your own wallet, thoroughly verify that it is the exact address you intend to send funds to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

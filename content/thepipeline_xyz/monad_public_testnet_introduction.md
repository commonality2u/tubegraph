[[monad_testnet_launch | The Monad public testnet]] is now live, marking a significant milestone for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article outlines how to get started on the testnet, including connecting a wallet, acquiring testnet tokens, and exploring featured applications.

## Accessing the Testnet

The primary landing page for the Monad testnet can be accessed via `testnet.monad.xyz` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For those already part of the Monad community or looking for a specific experience, `monadtestnet.phantom.me` offers a tailored [[integration_of_phantom_with_monad_testnet | Phantom wallet]] experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## [[connecting_a_wallet_to_the_monad_testnet | Connecting a Wallet]]

The first step on the testnet landing page is to connect your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While some wallets offer native testnet support, others may require you to manually add the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. An easy-to-use button allows for auto-addition of the testnet to wallets like MetaMask in a single step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## [[acquiring_testnet_tokens_and_making_transactions | Acquiring Testnet Tokens]]

To interact with the testnet, you'll need testnet tokens, which can be obtained via the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Simply paste your public address into the designated field and click "get testnet mod" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The amount of tokens available to claim may vary based on certain parameters, and the faucet refreshes daily, so it's advisable to check it regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Making Your First Trade and Exploring [[featured_applications_and_experiences_on_monad_testnet | Featured Applications]]

Once you have testnet tokens, you can make your first trade directly on the landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Three meme coins are available: House of Mandac, House of Makaki, and House of Chog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These trades are facilitated by Blinks by Dialect and are powered by Uniswap, which is another significant day-one deployment on the testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Beyond initial transactions, a multitude of experiences are available:
*   **Fantasy Top**: A tournament was scheduled to begin the day after the testnet launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Featured Apps**: Other applications highlighted on the main landing page include Rare Bet Sports, 42 KY, Kuru, Curv, and ANS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Ecosystem Directory

To discover new applications and experiences, an "ecosystem directory" is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This directory will be continuously updated throughout the testnet phase, making it the primary resource for finding new activities on the [[monad_testnet_launch | Monad public testnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Users are encouraged to revisit this page frequently to stay informed about new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Purpose of the Testnet and Community Involvement

The purpose of the testnet is to allow users to try out various dApps and provide feedback to teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. It serves as a lower-stakes, lower-risk environment to test new application experiences in a production-like setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Community involvement is highly encouraged within the [[introduction_to_monad_for_developers_and_users | Monad ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Individuals are invited to get active and build, whether they are:
*   Artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>
*   Technical contributors or developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
*   Video creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   "Spaces yappers" (live audio discussants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>

The testnet offers an opportunity for anyone to rise as a thought leader and contribute, as there is a place and significant opportunity for everyone in the [[introduction_to_monad_for_developers_and_users | Monad ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

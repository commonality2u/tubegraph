When considering what happens after death, one perspective offered suggests a hopeful, albeit personal, inclination towards an afterlife, envisioning "a nice place out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, a more concrete and perhaps scientific belief is that the body "get decomposed and you go back into the Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This reflection falls under broader [[life_and_existence_reflections | life and existence reflections]].

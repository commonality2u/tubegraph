From: [[thepipeline_xyz]] <br/> 

The cryptocurrency space is considered a highly susceptible environment for hacks and exploits due to its nature of programmable money, making it a prime target for malicious actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. It combines traditional Web2 attack vectors with unique Web3 issues like smart contract execution problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## [[crypto_security_challenges | Crypto Security Challenges]]

Users in the crypto space are often caught between two massive pillars of attack vectors: traditional Web2 vulnerabilities and Web3 smart contract execution issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This constant pressure necessitates prudence and care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## [[core_targets_of_cyber_attackers | Core Targets of Cyber Attackers]]

Attackers typically target three main areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>:
*   **Funds**: Whatever is stored on-chain, exchanges, or wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Access**: The ability to use an individual as an interception point to compromise their colleagues, friends, or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. For public figures, compromised accounts can be leveraged in spear phishing campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Data**: Sensitive credentials stored anywhere must be rigorously audited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Common Attack Vectors

### [[Phishing scams in the crypto industry | Phishing Scams]]
[[Phishing scams in the crypto industry | Phishing]] is by far the most common attack vector, and these attacks are becoming significantly more versatile and sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Nation-states like North Korea run massive [[Phishing scams in the crypto industry | phishing]] farms targeting individuals from top founders to everyday traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

Common [[Phishing scams in the crypto industry | phishing]] tactics include:
*   **Spoofed Websites**: Attackers create websites that look nearly identical to legitimate ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Users may approve unintended actions or lose credentials by interacting with these sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Malicious Ads**: Attackers purchase ad space on search engines for popular crypto-related terms (e.g., "Uniswap") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Clicking these ads can lead to spoofed websites that are highly convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Domain Spoofing**: Attackers create similar-looking domain names by using interchangeable characters (e.g., 'rn' for 'm', 'l' for 'i') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. These can appear in comments, DMs, or emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Spear Phishing**: Targeted attempts, often through DMs (e.g., on Twitter or Discord), where attackers impersonate companies or offer fake job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. These often include malicious links (e.g., meeting links) or requests to download executables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Malicious Files**: PDFs or Word documents (.docx) can contain macros that execute code, leading to compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

### Smart Contract Execution Issues
Vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Users unfamiliar with code should be very prudent about the contracts they interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

### Compromised Applications and Software
*   **Malicious Chrome Extensions**: Extensions can be malicious and gain access to cookies, credentials, or other sensitive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Attackers may pay influencers to promote these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.
*   **Outdated Software**: Not keeping operating systems, browsers, Twitter, and Discord updated can leave users susceptible to known vulnerabilities, including zero-day exploits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Exploits
While crucial, MFA is not bulletproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **SMS-based MFA**: This is insecure because if a phone number is compromised through a SIM swap, attackers gain access to all accounts using SMS-based MFA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This can include Google accounts, exchanges, and bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Prompt Bombing**: Attackers spam an authenticator app with MFA requests, hoping the user will eventually approve one out of annoyance or distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle on Public Wi-Fi**: On unsecure public Wi-Fi networks (e.g., Starbucks, conferences), attackers can set up malicious access points to intercept traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. When a user logs in, the attacker can capture usernames, passwords, and MFA codes, allowing them to replay the login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

### Service Desk and Account Recovery Exploits
Attackers can gather enough information about a user to spam service desks (e.g., for Twitter or phone carriers) and trick them into resetting passwords or providing account access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. This is a common method for SIM swapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

### [[address_poisoning_attacks_in_cryptocurrency | Address Poisoning Attacks]]
[[address_poisoning_attacks_in_cryptocurrency | Address poisoning attacks]] occur when an attacker monitors a user's transaction ledger (e.g., on Etherscan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. They then send a small transaction to the user from an address that looks very similar to one the user frequently interacts with, especially the first and last characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. If the user isn't paying close attention, they might accidentally copy this similar-looking address from their transaction history and send a large amount of funds to the attacker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.

### QR Codes
Scanning random QR codes, especially in public places like airports, can be dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

## [[Best practices for crypto security | Best Practices for Crypto Security]]

For [[Getting started in crypto for beginners with safety tips | new crypto users]] and experienced "trench warriors" alike, constant self-awareness and proactive measures are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Self-Audit and Mindset
*   **Critical Self-Audit**: Understand all potential points of failure in your digital life, creating an "attack surface map" to identify and mitigate concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Paranoia and Humility**: Be as "schizophrenic and paranoid as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Never be overconfident, as new scam varieties constantly emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Assume you are a target and that attackers are smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.
*   **Verify Before Trusting**: Always verify the source of any link, email, or application before interacting with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. For password resets, go directly to the website rather than clicking links in emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   **Avoid Urgency**: Attackers often capitalize on urgency (e.g., "quick 20-30x," "alpha") to bypass user due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. Take a deep breath and verify before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

### Account and Device Security
*   **Strong MFA**: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on every account holding funds or important data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   Avoid SMS-based MFA due to SIM swap risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   Prioritize hardware-based MFA (e.g., YubiKeys) for physical security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   If hardware isn't an option, use an Authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator), ideally on a secondary device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Back up your MFA codes securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Secure Recovery Methods**: Lock down all account recovery methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Use a SIM access code or communicate directly with your phone provider about not allowing unauthorized access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Password Management**: Use a credible password manager like Bitwarden, or ideally, keep sensitive information air-gapped on physical paper or in a crypto capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Regular Updates**: Keep your operating system, browser, and all applications (Twitter, Discord) up to date, preferably with automatic updates turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Browser Extensions Audit**: Be cautious about what Chrome extensions you download, ensuring they are credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Regularly audit and remove any unrecognized or unnecessary extensions from your browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.
*   **Avoid Executables and Macros**: Never download or run executables from untrusted sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. Be aware that documents like PDFs and .docx files can contain malicious macros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. Use tools like `dangerzone.rocks` to safely review PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **Public Wi-Fi**: Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive crypto activities due to [[access_point_vulnerabilities | potential traffic monitoring]] and malicious access points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. If absolutely necessary, use a VPN, but even then, it carries risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   **Multisig Key Distribution**: For multi-signature wallets, ensure keys are not stored in one place. Use different hardware wallets so a compromise of one does not affect all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

### Wallet Management
*   **Cold Wallets (Offline Storage)**: Use cold wallets as much as possible for storing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The private keys are offline, making them far more secure from online hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Back up recovery phrases offline in a safe, ideally fireproof, location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Hot Wallets (Online Storage)**: Hot wallets are connected to the internet and are easier to use for frequent transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Do not keep too much money on a hot wallet due to higher compromise risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **Wallet Segmentation**: Maintain separate wallets for different purposes: a "burner" wallet, a trading wallet, and a storage wallet, with cold wallets in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Address Verification**: Always verify the exact address when sending crypto, especially when copying from transaction history, to avoid [[how_hackers_exploit_similar_looking_addresses | address poisoning attacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. Have a centralized, airtight source for your addresses and bookmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

## High-Profile Cases and Examples

*   **Ronin Network/Sky Mavis Hack**: A devops engineer was phished with a job offer, leading them to click an executable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. This single point of failure allowed attackers to gain access to four keys of a multisig, which required five out of nine keys to unlock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. Through lateral movement, they compromised another device to get the fifth key, resulting in a half-billion-dollar exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. This highlights the dangers of social engineering and centralized points of failure, especially in the [[challenges_in_the_cryptocurrency_gaming_sector | cryptocurrency gaming sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   **Y22 Trader Compromise**: A notable trader's Twitter thread was exploited when an impersonator posted a malicious Telegram group link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. The impersonator mimicked Twitter history, follower count, and even had a gold checkmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. Users were prompted to verify on their phone, then perform an action on their desktop browser where hot wallets were located, leading to compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

## Future Outlook

While improvements to user experience (UX) like account abstraction (e.g., Fuse Wallet offering two points of failure instead of one) are emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>, the ultimate answer for security remains using cold wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. The crypto space is inherently one where people are "out to get you," and this mindset should be ingrained in users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. The goal is to reduce the risk of compromise as much as possible, as at some point, something is likely to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.

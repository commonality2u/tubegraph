The emergence and prevalence of [[state_of_meme_coins | memecoins]] have presented unique [[challenges_faced_by_crypto_startups | challenges]] for venture capitalists (VCs) within the cryptocurrency space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Initially, many VCs reportedly laughed at and insulted [[state_of_meme_coins | memecoins]], but this sentiment quickly shifted as they recognized the limitations of the "high FDV (fully diluted valuation) low float meta" investment strategy, realizing there was no one left to buy these unlocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Reputation and Investor Relations

A primary challenge for VCs stems from their core incentive: raising funds to deploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. A positive reputation for the crypto industry is crucial for engaging with sophisticated investors, such as those managing hundreds of millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These investors are looking for the "future of finance" and are not interested in the humor or speculative nature of [[state_of_meme_coins | memecoins]] like Pepe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

The widespread attention garnered by [[state_of_meme_coins | memecoins]] like "Harry Potter Obama Sonic inu" makes a VC's job significantly harder when pitching to their Limited Partners (LPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. VCs often find themselves needing to explain what [[state_of_meme_coins | memecoins]] are, why they are pumping, and how to differentiate them from "legitimate emerging technologies" within crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This creates confusion for LPs, especially when their own children might be discussing [[state_of_meme_coins | memecoins]] they are buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The perception that crypto is merely a place for "lottery tickets" rather than serious investment opportunities is a significant hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Impact on Crypto's Image

The open, permissionless, and decentralized nature of crypto allows anyone to create [[state_of_meme_coins | memecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This lack of control, while central to crypto's ethos, means that the most viral content can often be speculative or questionable, drawing attention away from the "good aspect" of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

According to some, [[the_impact_of_memecoins_on_the_perception_of_the_crypto_industry | memecoins]] contribute to "financial nihilism" and the perception that the entire crypto industry is a "scam" or a "joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This generalization is frustrating for teams building meaningful projects, as their hard work is often overshadowed by the casual dismissal of crypto as a whole due to the prevalence of [[memecoins_as_a_financial_phenomenon_with_implications_for_retail_investors | memecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Retail Investor Concerns and Insider Tactics

One significant problem highlighted is that [[memecoins_as_a_financial_phenomenon_with_implications_for_retail_investors | retail investors]] frequently get "cooked" (suffer losses) on these tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The "low float, high FDV kind of scams are very rampant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. While some legitimate projects provide transparent unlock schedules, many teams make it difficult to find such information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

The lack of regulation comparable to traditional financial markets exacerbates this issue. There is no equivalent of a quarterly submission requirement or a Form S9 (for insider stock sales) in crypto, which means teams can potentially OTC (over-the-counter) their tokens without being subject to vesting schedules, leading to misaligned incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This directly impacts the perception of [[cryptocurrency_venture_capital_investments | cryptocurrency venture capital investments]] and the integrity of the market.

Pancakes_BR, known for his "Good Vibes" and "wholesome Vibes" on Crypto Twitter, emphasizes the profound significance of [[importance_of_community_in_crypto_projects | community]] in the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. His approach to building a personal brand and career in the space is deeply rooted in [[role_of_community_and_collaboration_in_crypto_projects | genuine engagement]], positive interactions, and long-term relationship building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>.

## Pancakes_BR's Philosophy and Journey

Pancakes_BR initially started his Twitter account with a more aggressive, joking persona but found greater success and ease by simply being himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. He discovered that staying genuine and honest was a "growth hack" for [[the_importance_of_networking_and_community_connections_in_cryptocurrency | networking]] in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. He highlights the importance of avoiding constant fighting, which many people in crypto do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:52">[02:14:52]</a>.

His journey in crypto began in 2017, but he truly got involved with the [[importance_of_community_and_engagement_in_crypto_projects | community]] in 2021 after creating the Pancakes_BR account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The initial goal was to be a "worst trader possible" persona, but it evolved into a platform for [[building_and_engaging_community_in_crypto_spaces | networking]] and finding a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Key moments that reinforced his belief in the power of community include:
*   Early support from influential figures like Kobe, who retweeted him and provided a growth boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   Joining "Grug Hub" through a friend, which became a significant [[crypto_community_support | network]] for meeting respected individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:04">[05:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   His strategic decision to refuse paid "shills" despite being financially broke, prioritizing his long-term reputation and [[the_importance_of_community_building_in_crypto_and_gaming | trustworthiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   A stroke of luck with an NFT pack sale (Parallel Prime Key) provided enough funds to attend conferences, where he met many key figures in person, gaining trust and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:11">[07:10:11]</a>.
*   Securing a job at Idex after publicly tweeting about seeking employment, highlighting how personal reputation and connections trump traditional resumes in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## Community as the Foundation of Crypto

Pancakes_BR views Crypto Twitter (CT) as a "real community" where individuals form genuine, close friendships, contrary to his initial expectations of it being a purely competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

### Why Community is Crucial:
*   **Opportunity for Outliers**: Crypto offers a unique environment where individuals can prove themselves based on their abilities and character, rather than traditional credentials like degrees or resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Trust and Empathy**: Being a "good person" and trustworthy is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Empathy and a light-hearted approach, avoiding arguments, help maintain a positive presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Learning**: Companies value individuals who can deliver, learn quickly, and pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   **Bear Market Resilience**: [[Building Communities in Crypto | Building a strong network]] and friendships makes navigating bear markets more enjoyable and provides support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

### The Role of Companies in Community:
Pancakes_BR asserts that successful crypto projects understand the culture and engage authentically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Authenticity over Corporatism**: Protocols that try to sound too professional or corporate are often "put off by tourists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Companies should have a human presence on Twitter, like a person behind the logo, that understands the "fun meme culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding the "Room"**: Being part of the community allows companies to instinctively "read the room" and tailor their communication to the prevailing sentiment, whether it's humor or empathy during tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Founders as Community Leaders**: Engaged founders and leaders who are grateful for community support and actively lead initiatives create a positive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Hiring ambassadors or marketers who are already part of the community is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Advice for New Entrants

Pancakes_BR offers clear advice for newcomers aspiring to work or deepen their involvement in crypto:
*   **Consistency**: Show up every day, tweet consistently, and stay engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. OGs in the space notice small accounts that stick around and don't get discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Be Genuine and Kind**: Be yourself, but avoid being an "asshole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Be empathetic, light-hearted, and avoid taking things too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Control**: This is the biggest advantage in crypto, regardless of role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Avoid getting "tilted" by short-term emotions or negative interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   **Engage Actively**: Reply to influential accounts and engage with every person who comments on your posts or sends DMs, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This builds engagement and establishes you as a genuine community member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Provide Value for Free**: Be willing to offer your skills and help without immediate expectation of payment, as this can lead to larger opportunities in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Thinking**: Prioritize long-term reputation over short-term gains, such as rejecting paid shills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   **No Tribalism**: The crypto space is still small, and infighting or tribalism is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Everyone should view themselves as being on the same team, hoping for mutual success, as a "rising tide lifts all ships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Future of Crypto and Community

Pancakes_BR is excited about the future of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and their technical improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. However, for mass adoption, he believes the future lies in:
*   **Social Platforms**: Building social media platforms or apps that are genuinely fun and appealing, attracting users because of the enjoyable experience rather than solely for being "crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **Music Industry Disruption**: He is very bullish on crypto disrupting the music industry, not through NFTs, but by protocols ensuring artists are paid quickly and efficiently, addressing the issue where a large percentage of music money never reaches the artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

He acknowledges that the NFT bull run brought in new people but also created negative perceptions due to "grifting" and lack of understanding of bear markets, alienating powerful mainstream figures who could have contributed positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. He hopes the next cycle will involve a "better" approach to crypto, even if it's a long-term process, focusing on genuine utility and positive perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. Ultimately, the industry needs to recognize its collective mission and avoid internal conflicts, focusing on improving the experience for the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.

This article explores insights and challenges related to growing and sustaining a crypto podcast, drawing from the experiences of "monad only" and its inspiration, "up only."

## Origins and Aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
The podcast "monad only" launched with inspiration from "up only," a well-known crypto podcast, aiming to replicate its success and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Many crypto podcast hosts look up to "up only" and have watched every episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Key Learnings for Podcast Hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

### The Importance of Organic Conversation
A significant takeaway from hosting a show is the value of allowing conversation to flow freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Early on, "up only" attempted to be structured with specific questions about products, but its best shows occurred when hosts "jammed" on topics without hitting prepared questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Letting the conversation flow freely is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Access and Perspective
For hosts without prior experience in growing a large crypto following, starting a podcast can open doors to engaging conversations with "smart people on the right side of the curve" and "characters on the left side of the curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This provides significant [[The importance of organic conversation in podcasts | personal learning]] and new perspectives on crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. It addresses the [[Challenges and strategies in crypto investment | challenge]] of acquiring good information and meaningful conversations without a large network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Challenges of Sustaining a Crypto Podcast

### Filling the Void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
After "up only" paused its episodes, a "gaping hole" appeared in the crypto podcast space, particularly for "crypto culture" podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Many have tried to replicate the success of "up only," but it is difficult to pull off due to the unique dynamic of the original hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Market and Narrative Shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>
"Up only" found its best format when it was organic and unplanned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The show paused after covering the FTX debacle, and an "appropriate time to press unpause" has not yet emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While there is positive energy for its return, the prevailing "negative energy" in crypto, including trolls, can be defeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Host Availability and Future Prospects
The busy schedules of former hosts, with one running a new company and the other engaged in a CrossFit hobby, make it challenging to resume the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The podcast's success in attracting high-profile guests like Balaji Srinivasan, Mark Cuban, and even Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao on the same show, highlights its unique reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. However, a high percentage of past guests facing legal trouble (the "curse") is noted humorously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Podcast Production and Setup
Monad headquarters features a "nap room" that has been converted into a third podcast studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The setup includes a controversial body pillow/bean bag, which has a "massive negative association with bean bags and crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The ideal podcast production emphasizes "no edit podcasting" and live production to overcome the "greatest limitation to publishing," which is perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.

## [[Advice for crypto founders | Advice for Founders and Investors]] in Crypto

### Sustaining a Business Plan
For a builder starting out in crypto, it is crucial to have a business plan that ensures sustainability for the team long-term, ideally for 5 to 10 years, as successful startups often take over 10 years to reach sustainable revenue prior to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. Companies are going public and becoming profitable much later than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

### The "Build it and They Will Come" Fallacy
Relying solely on user growth without a clear business model is challenging; the scale of users needed is massive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>. Having "bridge revenue" or a "cash cow" alongside efforts to build a user base is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>. Continuous fundraising leaves a founder at the whim of market narratives and macro conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

### Meme Coins vs. Real World Utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>
The crypto space is often criticized for being dominated by meme coins, which are largely seen as "pump and dump schemes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Many believe they are made by a few individuals to create liquidity for themselves, preying on a "YOLO cycle" and "financial nihilism" among new investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. While a small fraction of meme coins might create "real culture," the vast majority (99.9%) are considered "absolute trash" that will go to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

The focus should be on building "something real," such as infrastructure, application layers, financial derivatives, or putting real-world goods on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. The idea of NFTs as titles or deeds for real-world assets, such as construction equipment with detailed metadata, is a vision for the future of crypto, distinct from current "jpeg" NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. For real-world adoption, the crypto element needs to be "completely invisible" to the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.

Dev fatigue from meme coins is real, as talented developers may be tempted to manufacture quick gains instead of building long-term products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. The strong narrative around quick wealth from meme coins can be disheartening for those building legitimate projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

### The Problem of "Skinny Doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>
Many crypto assets are characterized by "fat people and very few skinny doors," meaning many holders trying to exit through limited liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. When large holders (like VCs or "degenerate kings" of meme coins) decide to dump, the market can collapse, leaving others holding the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This contrasts with assets like the S&P 500 or Timberland in Alabama, which people genuinely want to hold long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

### Financial and Personal Well-being
It's important to identify one's "endgame" and goals for investment activities, focusing on quality of life rather than solely financial numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. People should define "enough" and be mindful of what they sacrifice to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.

The "house money" fallacy and mental bracketing of net worth can be dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. Even if an initial gain feels like "house money," it becomes money owed to taxes if realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. Moreover, seeing a portfolio hit a peak can mentally "bracket" one's net worth, leading to distress if it falls, regardless of initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>.

A crucial piece of [[Challenges and opportunities in cryptocurrency investment | advice for crypto investors]] is to "take some off the table" when successful, even if it feels counterintuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. Achieving significant gains (e.g., $10 million from $15,000) is rare and should be secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. This allows for financial security, future investments, and optimization for personal life and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>.

Ultimately, crypto should not become one's sole identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. While invested and a believer, diversifying focus beyond crypto is healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.

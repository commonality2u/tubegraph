The primary value of events, such as the Monad Madness pitch competition, is not found in the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Instead, attendees are encouraged to dedicate their time to [[networking_and_meeting_builders | meeting the individuals]] around them and to cherish these moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This emphasis on personal interaction highlights the significant benefit of [[networking_and_meeting_builders | building connections]] and relationships at such gatherings.

When asked to consider what title their life would have if it were a song, one individual suggested "Just Do It" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This choice reflects a motivational outlook, implying the absence of hindrances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This concept aligns with the broader theme of [[describing_life_as_a_song_title]].

### Personal Motivation and Passion

The chosen song title, "Just Do It," encapsulates a strong sense of drive and enthusiasm that the individual experiences in their current work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. They express gratitude for the chance to work on something they are "extremely passionate about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This passion is so significant that it leads them to "wake up excited every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This is a marked contrast to their previous employment, where this level of excitement was "100% not the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

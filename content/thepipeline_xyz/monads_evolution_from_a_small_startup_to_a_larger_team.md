Monad, initially a small software startup, has undergone significant [[historical_development_of_the_Monad_community | growth and transformation]] over the past 16 months, evolving from a remote, engineering-focused team into a larger, more integrated organization with a strong physical presence and a vibrant community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Early Days: A Small, Engineering-Heavy Startup
Around 12 months ago, Monad consisted of approximately seven people, primarily focused on engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. The initial 16 months were characteristic of a software startup, involving extensive whiteboarding, brainstorming, and architecting a complex system while maintaining compatibility with the existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The team worked to solve complex technical challenges with a combination of excitement and the realization of many potential directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Transition to Physical Presence and Team Growth
Monad began as a fully remote company in early 2022, embracing the worldwide nature of crypto to find talent globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. However, by the start of 2023 (approximately 14 months ago), a critical mass of two people in New York led to the decision to establish a physical office space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

This led to the following office transitions:
*   **Initial WeWork Office**: Monad started with a Sixers WeWork office that was initially used a few times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Expansion within WeWork**: This space quickly grew to accommodate 25 people as more team members flew into New York for on-site work weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Office Floor**: The team realized the significant benefits of in-person collaboration, not just for engineering but also for ecosystem and business development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This led to moving into an entire floor in an office space located in Nomad (North of Madison Square Park) in New York, a coincidental but fitting name given Monad's branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## Expanding Focus Beyond Engineering
As Monad grew, its focus expanded beyond core engineering:
*   **[[growth_and_development_of_the_Monad_community | Community Development]]**: The team increasingly emphasized [[growth_and_development_of_the_Monad_community | community development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Business Development**: There was a concerted effort to grow the business development team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Development**: Monad brought on its first ecosystem development hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## [[Growth and development of the Monad community | Community and Ecosystem Growth]]
The [[historical_development_of_the_Monad_community | development of the team]] directly led to a significant [[growth_and_development_of_the_Monad_community | development of the Monad community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Key aspects of this [[growth_and_development_of_the_Monad_community | community development]] include:
*   **Culture Building**: Bill, a core part of the team, has been instrumental in building the community's culture since day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Creative Contributions**: The community actively produces artwork, music (both AI-generated and otherwise), and other creative content, demonstrating vibrant engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Conversations**: Monad has engaged in productive discussions with project teams interested in multi-chain expansion to the Monad ecosystem, as well as new crypto teams looking to build Monad-native applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Shifting Perceptions**: Early conversations often revolved around "why an L1," but now the focus has shifted to inquiries about Monad's [[monads_plans_and_milestones_for_the_coming_year | plans for testnet]] and beyond, indicating a broader understanding and acceptance of Monad's vision as a high-performing L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Looking Ahead: Continued Expansion and Presence
Looking to the future, Monad anticipates continued team building across all areas, particularly in engineering and ecosystem support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The team plans for an increased physical presence at various conferences and potentially hosting its own events and hackathons in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. The aim is to strengthen Monad's presence and engage more deeply within the broader crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

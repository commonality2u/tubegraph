Attackers typically target three core areas when attempting to compromise an individual's security posture: funds, access, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Effective security measures are crucial to protect against these threats.

## Primary Targets of Attackers

### Funds
Attackers aim to seize funds stored on-chain, centralized exchanges (CEXes), or in various types of wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. [[navigating_risk_and_security_in_crypto_investments | Securing these assets]] is paramount for anyone involved in cryptocurrency or digital finance.

### Access
Gaining access to an individual's accounts allows attackers to use them as an interception point to reach others, whether colleagues, friends, or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. For public figures, unauthorized access to their accounts could be leveraged in [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | spear fishing campaigns]] to compromise others, or to send malicious meeting invitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This highlights the broader implications of [[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | user security]].

### Data
Sensitive credentials and other personal data are also prime targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Wherever such information is stored, it must be [[protecting_sensitive_data_and_credentials | rigorously audited]] to prevent unauthorized access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Identifying and Mitigating Risks

A critical step in enhancing security is to have a strong understanding of all potential points of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This involves:
*   **Inventorying Assets**: Cataloging all accounts, devices, and digital presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Creating an Attack Surface Map**: Identifying all points of concern where a vulnerability might exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Mitigation**: Continuously tweaking and mitigating identified risks as they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

By proactively managing these aspects, individuals can significantly strengthen their overall security posture against potential attackers.

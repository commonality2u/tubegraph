Creating a compelling game is considered a greater challenge than simply developing an [[incorporating_blockchain_in_gaming | on-chain game]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The primary bottleneck for gaming remains the creation of a good game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Prioritizing Game Development

It is often suggested that a good game should be developed first, before [[integrating_nfts_in_games | asset tracking]] or other on-chain components are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For instance, the integration of [[the_role_and_future_of_nfts_in_gaming | NFTs]] with a platform like Roblox would make sense because Roblox was established as a game first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The main obstacle for gaming is to first create a fun game and then consider putting its components [[incorporating_blockchain_in_gaming | on-chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Existing Trading Behaviors and Security Concerns

Even without blockchain integration, gamers have historically engaged in asset trading:
*   Gamers trade CS:GO skins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   The RuneScape gray market for gold has existed for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

However, these traditional methods of trading come with significant [[security_issues_in_gamerelated_transactions | security issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Users frequently become victims of scams, often resorting to insecure methods like wire transferring money to anonymous individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Such practices are considerably less secure than using crypto for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

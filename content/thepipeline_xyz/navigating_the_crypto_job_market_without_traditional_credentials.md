The cryptocurrency industry, often perceived as a "Wild West," offers unique [[opportunities_and_careers_within_blockchain_communities | opportunities and careers within blockchain communities]] for individuals, even those without traditional academic backgrounds or extensive resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. Success in this space often hinges on authenticity, community engagement, and a willingness to learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>.

## A Non-Traditional Path to Crypto Success

Pancakes_BR, a notable figure on crypto Twitter known for his "wholesome vibes," exemplifies how one can forge a successful career in crypto without a conventional resume or university degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. His journey highlights the emphasis the crypto space places on what an individual can deliver, rather than their credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>.

### From Music Industry to Crypto Twitter
Pancakes_BR found crypto in 2017 while working in the music industry, managing artists since he was 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. He initially observed from a distance, buying and losing money, eventually deciding to travel after a bad trading experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

In 2021, he jokingly created the "Pancakes_BR" Twitter account with the persona of being the "worst trader possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This persona evolved into him simply being himself – genuine, honest, and not engaging in online fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. He saw this approach as a "growth hack" to networking in the space, particularly given the demand for marketing and business development (BD) professionals in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Building a Network and Gaining Trust
Recognizing he lacked a traditional resume and degree, Pancakes_BR strategically built his Twitter account to network his way into a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

He became deeply involved in crypto communities, notably joining Grug Hub, which he describes as "the highest Alpha group chat on Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. He focused on building relationships by being himself, despite having no "Alpha" or technical abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

A crucial decision was to refuse paid "shills" (promotions) even when he was financially struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. He intuitively felt this would be better for his long-term reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This choice, combined with a lucky NFT sale, allowed him to attend conferences, meet people in real life, and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

> "If people trust you in this space the opportunities are unlimited." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>

He attributes his career shift to being "very, very good at" buying a token only for its price to go straight down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. Realizing he wasn't suited for trading, he focused on finding ways to contribute to companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

### Landing a Job and Sustaining a Career
His first job in crypto came from a "serious tweet" asking for employment, which was retweeted by a prominent account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. This led to an offer from IDEX, a company he praises for their support, especially during a period of severe illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

> [!info] The Power of Networking
> Knowing anonymous but respected individuals in person, as well as company representatives, builds significant trust and opens doors to opportunities beyond what can be achieved by simply [[hiring_within_the_crypto_industry | hiring a random person from the timeline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

Getting job offers even during a bear market reinforced his belief in the longevity of his career in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

## Advice for Newcomers to Crypto Jobs

For those looking to enter the crypto job market without traditional credentials, Pancakes_BR offers several key pieces of advice:

### 1. Engage Authentically and Consistently
*   **Be Yourself (within reason):** If you are naturally funny or can play a unique character, leverage that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>. Otherwise, be genuine, kind, and empathetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:34:00">[36:34:00]</a>. Avoid being abrasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:27:00">[36:27:00]</a>.
*   **Stay Light-Hearted:** Don't take things too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:43:00">[36:43:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Control:** This is a huge advantage in crypto, whether for trading or networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50:00">[36:50:00]</a>. Avoid getting "tilted" or engaging in arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:19:00">[37:19:00]</a>.
*   **Show Up Every Day:** Consistent engagement is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>.
*   **Engage with Your Community:** Reply to comments on your posts and respond to every DM for as long as it's scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:05:00">[40:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. This builds engagement and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:44:00">[40:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:18:00">[41:18:00]</a>.
*   **Reply to Important People:** Engage with larger accounts and influential figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:39:00">[41:39:00]</a>.

### 2. Prioritize Reputation Over Quick Gains
*   **Avoid Paid Shills:** Turning down paid promotions, even when in need of money, preserves reputation and leads to better long-term opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Thinking:** Focus on building a sustainable presence rather than short-term financial wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:30:00">[42:30:00]</a>.

### 3. Be Willing to Learn and Contribute
*   **Self-Teach:** If you lack skills, find ways to teach yourself to be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:57:00">[38:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>.
*   **Start Small:** Opportunities like being a community manager for a Discord server or helping in Telegram groups can lead to learning and further opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:15:00">[44:15:00]</a>.
*   **Give Value for Free:** Offering help without immediately asking for something in return can open doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace Imposter Syndrome:** It's natural to feel like you don't know enough, but this provides an opportunity to learn and gain skills from the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:00">[39:36:00]</a>.

> *   Make most of your timeline your own tweets; don't retweet too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>.
> *   Engage in "reply guying" – consistently replying to others' tweets, especially prominent accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:27:00">[38:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:29:00">[38:29:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Community and Authenticity in Crypto

The crypto job market deeply values community and authenticity. Companies often prefer to [[hiring_within_the_crypto_industry | hire]] individuals who are genuinely part of the community and understand its culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>.

> [!info] Understanding the Culture
> Companies that understand and engage with the "fun meme culture" of crypto, rather than being overly corporate or tourist-like, are more likely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:14:00">[26:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>.

Reading the room, understanding the collective sentiment, and showing empathy are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>. When teams are genuinely part of the community, expressing these feelings comes naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>.

The concept of [[importance_of_crypto_native_hires | crypto-native hires]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>. Founders and teams who have spent time in the community, garnered trust, and know the "thought leaders" and general user sentiment have a significantly higher chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Avoiding Tribalism
> Despite the "PVP" (player versus player) nature of some interactions, the crypto space overall should foster a "we're all on the same team" mindset, especially when trying to achieve wider adoption and positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:46:00">[50:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:07:00">[51:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:19:00">[51:19:00]</a>. Infighting and tribalism, particularly during a [[adapting_to_changing_markets_in_crypto | bear market]], can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:44:00">[53:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>.

Ultimately, showing up every day, building a network, and being genuine are foundational elements for navigating the crypto job market successfully, even without traditional credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:00">[45:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:00:00">[46:00:00]</a>.

Building a strong and engaged community is crucial for crypto projects, extending beyond just marketing to create a vibrant ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:38">[10:33:38]</a>. The Monad community serves as a prime example of this approach, fostering deep relationships and leveraging diverse talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:04">[10:50:04]</a>.

## The Monad Community: A Case Study

The Monad community is described as being "by the Monad community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, with infectious vibes from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. Its origin story includes winning the first meme competition in the Telegram chat, which led to hosting Twitter spaces and bringing talent into the marketing cabal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

### Key Contributors and Their Roles
The Monad community benefits from a wide array of talented contributors from around the world with diverse backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:07">[03:48:07]</a>:
*   **Artists and Meme Makers:** Individuals like Skilly created a movement with their art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>, often creating custom profile pictures (PFPs) with quick turnaround times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Other notable artists mentioned include Rachel, Mario, and Saddam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:39">[02:58:39]</a>.
*   **Content Creators:** Ray J is noted for rapidly dropping AI videos or new soundbites in response to chat discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>. Naive is also shouted out for sick videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:30">[07:13:30]</a>, and Savant for high-quality clips with subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:40">[04:41:40]</a>.
*   **Community Leaders:** King Louie has "stepped up to like honestly going God Mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:02">[04:50:02]</a>, running "The Purge" and "Purgatory," and creating lore around his character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:38">[05:13:38]</a>. Dubs is recognized for his encyclopedic knowledge of the Telegram chat members and their interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:02">[02:53:02]</a>.
*   **General Contributors:** Many members are recognized for their active participation, including Intern Bra, Toes, Turo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:23">[02:50:23]</a>, White Socks, Bakbar, Aiden, Hottie, Fob, Dark Shade, Seang, J Cal, ID Kravitz, Shave the Whale, Harry, Zane, Port, XL1, Tech, Craty, Bug, Bersan, Jungi, Googly, and Lion Juan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:43">[03:29:43]</a>. "Ship posters" are also acknowledged for their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:02">[07:40:02]</a>.

### Community Structure and Evolution
The Monad community utilizes various platforms to enable diverse contributions:
*   **Discord:** Initially an invite-only Discord transitioned to an open one, leading to a significant inflow of members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:47">[21:48:47]</a>.
*   **Telegram:** The "lock Telegram" started right after Discord became open, with early star players like Danny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:34">[22:25:34]</a>. The Telegram chat, now with over 2 million messages, includes "purges" and "missions" to manage membership and maintain engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:16">[24:52:16]</a>. A key tool, provided by ID Kravitz, allows detailed tracking of member activity, including messages sent, join dates, and mission completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:02">[27:14:02]</a>.
*   **Twitter:** There's a high volume of art and content across Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:04">[20:14:04]</a>, with heavy tagging of accounts to ensure visibility, though excessive tagging might hurt engagement according to algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:04">[08:45:04]</a>.

This multi-vertical approach allows people to "stay in their lane and hammer what they do best," mirroring the diverse on-chain verticals like DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and social applications expected on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>.

## Strategies for [[importance_of_community_and_engagement_in_crypto_projects | Community Engagement]]

Monad's approach to [[building_communities_in_crypto | building communities in crypto]] emphasizes creating a "super engaged ecosystem" rather than just a marketing vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:04">[10:50:04]</a>.

*   **Rapid Content Creation:** The ability to quickly produce memes, art, and videos in response to ongoing conversations keeps engagement high and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Community-Led Initiatives:** Danny winning a meme competition and then hosting Twitter spaces demonstrates how internal talent can drive [[the_strategic_approach_to_engaging_with_a_crypto_community | engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
*   **Unique Cultural Elements:** Features like the "Purge" in the Telegram chat create a distinct culture and history within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:16">[24:52:16]</a>.
*   **Embracing "Cringe":** A philosophy of not being afraid to be "cringe" and putting oneself out there is encouraged, as often the least sentimental or uncertain content performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:15:35">[44:15:35]</a>.

## Benefits of a Strong [[the_role_of_community_in_the_crypto_industry | Community in the Crypto Industry]]

A thriving community offers significant advantages for a crypto project:

*   **Talent Pool:** The Monad community has become a "well of talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:44">[06:09:44]</a>, providing individuals for community and marketing roles for projects building on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:08">[05:43:08]</a>. These "Monad native" hires already deeply understand the project's lore and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   **Job Opportunities:** Being active in the community can lead to legitimate job opportunities in crypto, from meme maker roles to full-time positions for community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Integration:** Ecosystem projects that "tapped into our community the hardest and kind of just embraced our culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a> have seen the best success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:02">[11:42:02]</a>.
*   **"Financialization of Fun":** The ability to bring off-chain social interactions, co-creation, and identity building on-chain through games, NFTs, and meme coins creates a new dimension of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:00">[32:18:00]</a>.
*   **Product Adoption and Marketing Boost:** Investing time in [[importance_of_community_building_in_nft_projects | community building]] and providing entertainment and positive vibes goes a long way in driving product adoption and boosting marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:25:00">[41:25:00]</a>.

## Future Opportunities and Technological Foundations

The Monad team is excited for a future where high performance chains enable new on-chain applications that further enhance community interactions:

*   **High TPS and CLOBs:** With 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), Monad aims to support Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs) on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>. This would allow market makers to provide liquidity profitably on-chain, leading to deeper liquidity and better execution for traders, a significant leap from current Automated Market Makers (AMMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:44:00">[33:44:00]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Gaming Experiences:** High TPS and frictionless user experience (UX) will make it possible to play games on-chain, trade NFTs with friends, and participate in community initiatives like on-chain poker, making the games previously played for fun financially intertwined with community activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:29:00">[31:29:00]</a>.

## Philosophies for [[role_of_community_and_collaboration_in_crypto_projects | Community and Collaboration]]

Several core philosophies underpin the Monad community's success:

*   **Help Others Without Expectation:** Being nice and helping people without expecting a reward fosters goodwill and mutual benefit in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:24:00">[38:24:00]</a>.
*   **Value Your Team and "Crew":** The quality of the team you work with significantly determines success and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>. "If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>.
*   **Find Your Niche and Stick to It:** In a noisy and growing space, it's essential to "find your people and learning your thing sticking to your thing" rather than chasing every "shiny object" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:14:00">[43:14:00]</a>.
*   **Stay Humble:** Maintaining humility helps prevent losing sight of the project's goals and can prevent missteps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:00:00">[44:00:00]</a>.

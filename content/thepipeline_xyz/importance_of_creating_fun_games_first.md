Creating a game is considered more challenging than creating an on-chain game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The primary [[challenges_in_game_development | bottleneck]] for gaming is the act of creating a genuinely good game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Prioritizing Gameplay Over On-Chain Components

There is a preference against developing a game by first adding asset tracking and then focusing on gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For example, Roblox with [[role_of_nfts_in_gaming | NFTs]] makes significant sense because Roblox was established and fun first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The recommended approach for [[integrating_games_with_blockchain | integrating games with blockchain]] is to first create a fun game and then incorporate on-chain components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Lessons from Traditional Game Economies

Existing gray markets in traditional gaming highlight the importance of inherent game value. Gamers trade CS:GO skins and engage in the RuneScape gray market for gold, which has existed for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Despite users frequently experiencing scams and engaging in less secure methods like wire transfers to anonymous individuals, these markets thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This indicates that a game's appeal drives player engagement with its economy, even in the presence of [[security_issues_in_gaming_economies | security issues]].

## Missing Figures and Surprising Placements on the Yapper Leaderboard

The release of the [[kaito_ai_yapper_leaderboard_overview | Kaito AI Yapper Leaderboard]] generated discussion regarding both anticipated and unexpected placements of prominent community members. While some individuals secured top positions as expected, others were noted for their absence or surprisingly low rankings, leading to questions about their current activity or community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Unexpected Absences and Low Rankings

Several individuals were highlighted for their surprising positions or initial lack of visibility on the [[yapper_leaderboard_rankings_and_changes | Yapper Leaderboard]]:

He was eventually located, but his initial perceived absence was notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **King Louie NFA** – The speaker expressed a desire for King Louie to be higher on the list, suggesting his current ranking was lower than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Mondol** – Ranked 53rd, Mondol was identified as one of the earliest community members, implying that his position might be surprisingly low given his long-standing involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

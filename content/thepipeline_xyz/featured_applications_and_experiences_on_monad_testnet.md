The [[monad_public_testnet_introduction | Monad Public Testnet]] is now live, offering users the first opportunity to interact with the network [00:00:00]. This marks a significant moment for the [[developments_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad ecosystem]] [00:00:02].

## Getting Started on the Testnet

To begin, users can visit the [[monad_testnet_launch | Monad testnet]] landing page at `testnet.monad.xyz` [00:00:11] or `monadtestnet.phantom.me` for a [[integration_of_phantom_with_monad_testnet | Phantom wallet]] experience [00:00:20].

The initial steps involve:
*   **Connecting a Wallet**: The landing page prompts users to [[connecting_a_wallet_to_the_monad_testnet | connect a wallet]] [00:00:36]. While some wallets offer native testnet support, others may require manual network addition, which is simplified by an auto-add button for MetaMask and other wallets [00:00:40].
*   **Obtaining Testnet Tokens**: Users need testnet tokens via the faucet, which can be accessed by pasting a public address and clicking "get testnet mod" [00:01:04]. The amount claimable may vary, and the faucet refreshes daily [00:01:17].

## Initial Transactions and Spotlighted Experiences

Once testnet tokens are acquired, users can make their first trade [00:01:29]. The [[monad_testnet_launch | testnet]] features three meme coins: House of Mandac, House of Makaki, and House of Chog [00:01:37]. These can be bought directly on the landing page through Blinks by Dialect [00:01:43] and are powered by Uniswap [00:01:48]. Transactions are noted for their speed [00:02:01].

The [[monad_public_testnet_introduction | Monad public testnet]] highlights a multitude of experiences on day one [00:02:07], including:
*   **Fantasy Top**: A tournament is scheduled to start the day after the testnet launch [00:02:12].
*   **Featured Applications**: The main landing page showcases several featured apps such as Rarebet, Sports 42, Kuru, Curv, and ANS [00:02:18].

## Ecosystem Directory and Community Engagement

An [[onchain_elements_and_technology_used_in_monad_games | ecosystem directory]] is available and will be continually updated throughout the [[monad_testnet_launch | testnet]] phase with new apps and experiences [00:02:31]. This directory is designated as the primary resource for discovering new activities on the [[monad_public_testnet_introduction | Monad public testnet]], and users are encouraged to visit it frequently [00:02:41].

Users are encouraged to:
*   **Try Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Experiment with various dApps and provide feedback to development teams [00:02:57]. The purpose of the [[monad_testnet_launch | testnet]] is to deploy and test new app experiences in a lower-stakes environment [00:03:00].
*   **Join Communities**: Engage with the growing community momentum around [[monad_testnet_launch | Monad]] and its ecosystem projects [00:03:09].
*   **Get Active and Build**: Community members, whether artists, technical developers, video creators, or content creators, are encouraged to contribute and rise as thought leaders [00:03:16]. The [[developments_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad ecosystem]] offers significant opportunities for everyone [00:03:32].

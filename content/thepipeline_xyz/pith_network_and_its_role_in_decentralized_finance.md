The [[Pith Finances crosschain lending market | Pith Network]] is a crucial infrastructure project in the realm of [[Decentralized finance DeFi advancements | decentralized finance (DeFi)]], aiming to provide a high-fidelity source of truth for real-time market data. Led by CEO Mike Cahill of Duralabs and supported by key contributors like Monad Labs CEO Keone Hon, Pith is designed to address the critical need for accurate, low-latency data in a rapidly evolving digital financial landscape. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

## Origins and Vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

Mike Cahill, who previously worked at Jump Crypto alongside Keone Hon and James (Monad's co-founder), has a background in FX trading and sales. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> He began contributing to Pith in 2021, and Duralabs was formed in mid-2023 to allow the Jump team to dedicate full-time effort to the project. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

The core mission of [[Pith Finances crosschain lending market | Pith]] is to solve for the "source of Truth at t0" (time zero) in the blockchain space. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> This means providing the most immediate and accurate data possible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> While acknowledging that it's an ongoing process, Pith aims to build a "Universal data primitive" that is the best in the blockchain space. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>

## Synergy with Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>

There is significant synergy and a strong collaborative relationship between Monad and Pith. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> Both projects are excited by the intersection of finance and technology and the need for rigorous optimization and hard tech development. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> The founders' backgrounds in systematic trading emphasize the importance of efficient infrastructure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>

Monad, which offers synergistic opportunities akin to Solana but within an EVM layer, stands to benefit greatly from Pith's high-performance data. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> Keone Hon highlights shared values such as prioritizing [[Decentralized governance and the role of Pith token | decentralization]] and community, which are seen as fundamental to success in crypto. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>

## Unique Architecture and Business Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>

Unlike traditional oracles that often act as messaging protocols fetching data from various internet sources, Pith operates as a singular, direct source. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>

### PithNet: The Application-Specific Blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>

*   Pith runs its own application-specific blockchain called PithNet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>
*   Approximately 100 publishers, including major trading firms and crypto exchanges, publish 400 different symbols to PithNet multiple times per second. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>
*   This aggregated data is then accessible to 50 different blockchains and over 300 applications. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>
*   Pith handles around 4 million transaction updates per day. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>

### Incentivized Data Publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>

Pith addresses the changing business model of the internet, where data is increasingly moving behind paywalls. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
It incentivizes data owners (publishers) to provide their "paywall data" directly to the Pith source of truth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>
This creates a powerful economic model where publishers are rewarded based on the utility of their data on-chain, eliminating reliance on advertising. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>

*   When an application pulls Pith data onto its local chain (e.g., a Perps exchange on Monad), a small fee is paid. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>
*   This fee is then distributed to the data contributors (publishers), creating a sustainable business model. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>
*   This approach ensures data robustness and longevity, as it's not dependent on external scraping or at risk of legal action from traditional finance data providers (a $7 billion industry). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>

### Direct Source vs. Messenger Networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>

Traditional oracles often run "messenger" or "automation nodes" that fetch prices from websites or other sources based on specific timers or price changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a> This bespoke approach can lead to:
*   **Performance Limitations**: Difficult to achieve high performance due to intermediary steps. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>
*   **Scalability Issues**: Each "Oracle job" is often bespoke, lacking universal access and network effects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>
*   **Data Quality Compromises**: Profit maximization might incentivize reducing update frequency to bake in gas fees, leading to outdated data (e.g., 24-hour or 50 basis points updates). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a> This can lead to impermanent loss or adverse selection in DeFi applications. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>

In contrast, Pith's single, universal source benefits everyone equally as it becomes more powerful, fostering strong network effects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>

## Impact on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>

High-fidelity oracles like Pith are crucial for the health and competitiveness of [[Decentralized finance DeFi advancements | DeFi]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>

*   **Lending Protocols**: Precise pricing is essential for maintaining the safety and solvency of lending protocols, preventing issues like underwater vaults. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>
*   **Derivatives Contracts**: Accurate and up-to-date pricing is vital for the settlement of derivatives and the calculation of mark prices and funding rates in perpetuals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>
*   **Competitiveness with Centralized Exchanges**: More efficient data infrastructure helps [[Innovations in decentralized finance | DeFi]] compete with the cheaper execution costs often found on centralized exchanges. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>
*   **Sustainable LP Models**: Accurate Oracle data, as seen in projects like Synthetix, allows liquidity providers (LPs) to adjust prices based on real-world market conditions, creating a more sustainable and profitable business model for LPs, mitigating adverse selection risks inherent in static AMM curves. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>

## Institutional Adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>

Pith has successfully onboarded nearly 100 publishers, predominantly large institutions, including major trading firms like Jane Street, Susquehanna, Virtu, and DRW, as well as crypto exchanges. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> Notably, Cboe, the third-largest US equity exchange and largest options exchange, also contributes data. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a> This signifies a significant step in institutional adoption, as these entities are actively publishing data to a blockchain daily and engaging with crypto concepts like gas fees and tokens. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>

## Pith Token and [[Decentralized governance and the role of Pith token | Governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>

Pith is a decentralized Oracle, meaning its updates can be managed directly on-chain through [[Decentralized governance and the role of Pith token | governance]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>

*   **Airdrop**: A retrospective airdrop in November 2023 distributed the Pith token (an SPL token) to users of applications across 27 blockchains, involving approximately 100,000 wallets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>
*   **Community Engagement**: The airdrop aimed to socialize the decentralized infrastructure. While about half of the initial 100,000 eligible wallets claimed the token, the number of wallets staking in the Pith protocol has since grown to 110,000, more than double the initial claiming rate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a> This indicates strong community belief and participation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>
*   **Governance Milestones**: The first vote for the Pith Constitution marks a significant step, empowering the community to manage the network. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a> Comparing Pith's 110,000 staking wallets to other DeFi projects (Aave: ~15,000, GMX: ~20,000, Synthetix: ~40,000) highlights its rapid community growth and excitement. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>

## The Importance of Infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>

Mike Cahill emphasizes that while people often look for "killer apps," the underlying infrastructure is the most critical component. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a> Just as an Uber app couldn't exist without the iPhone's GPS and pocket computer capabilities, [[Decentralized finance DeFi advancements | DeFi]] needs robust, performant infrastructure to enable future applications. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a> This long-term perspective encourages optimism, as continuous improvements in infrastructure will eventually lead to "overnight successes" and widespread adoption, similar to the long development cycles seen in AI before the advent of ChatGPT. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>

Keone Hon echoes this, noting that despite the rapid pace of crypto, the fundamental growth in [[Decentralized finance DeFi advancements | DeFi]]'s Total Value Locked (TVL) from around $1 billion before DeFi Summer 2020 to approximately $50 billion currently, shows a massive underlying structure being built that will lead to further significant changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>

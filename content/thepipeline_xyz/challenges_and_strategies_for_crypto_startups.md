Carl, a partner at Six-Man Ventures, an early-stage crypto fund founded in 2021, emphasizes that building a strong company and enterprise value is more critical than just building a great product for [[startups_in_crypto | crypto startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The talk, titled "Product and Company Building," aims to consolidate learned experiences for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

He notes that while first-time founders often prioritize product, second-time founders understand the importance of distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The goal for founders should be to focus on creating enterprise value for themselves, their employees, and the ecosystem, rather than solely on developing a good product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Most founders spend 70-80% of their time on product, but should shift focus more towards company building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Company Building
Company building involves crucial aspects like cash management, fundraising, brand awareness, hiring, vision, and mergers & acquisitions (M&A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### 1. Pick the Right Co-founder
Building a business is an incredibly difficult and often lonely endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Having a co-founder who is equally invested can significantly boost morale and provide support during challenging periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

Key considerations for choosing a co-founder:
*   **Complementary Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>: Seek someone who complements your skills rather than replicates them. For example, two highly technical engineers might not be as effective as a team with one technical person and one business-savvy individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Attributes like product sense, technical acumen, market analysis, and community management are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Personality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>: Complementary personalities can lead to stronger decision-making.
*   **Network** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>: A co-founder with a different network vastly enhances your ability to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Founder-Market Fit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>: Investors highly value this, especially for early-stage companies. If you're building a DeFi protocol, having a background in traditional finance or as a market maker demonstrates market understanding and technical capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. If you lack deep founder-market fit, consider bringing someone who has it to quickly understand the market and access relevant networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Obsession** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>: Both co-founders should be obsessed with the problem space they are building in, as competition means someone else is likely equally dedicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Founders who are only part-time involved or split focus are often seen as an "insta-pass" by investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### 2. Optimize for a Massive Financial Outcome
If you take venture capital, you must aim for a significant financial return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Venture investors typically look for a path to a 100x return, as a 10x return is not considered interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Key financial strategies:
*   **Avoid Over-Dilution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>: Diluting too much too early can make it difficult to attract later-stage investors who seek meaningful ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. If you have significant dilution in one round, avoid over-diluting in the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Don't Fret Over Small Valuation Differences** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>: For the right strategic partners, a slightly lower valuation is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Achieving a billion-dollar outcome is extremely challenging, so optimizing for success by bringing the best people to the table outweighs minor percentage differences in valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### 3. Create Enterprise Value with Capital
The purpose of raising capital is to create enterprise value, not just to build a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. Product Managers think about products, while CEOs think about enterprise value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

Types of Enterprise Value:
*   **Revenue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>: The most straightforward measure, demonstrating the ability to drive and grow income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Brand Awareness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>: Becoming a recognized leader in a crypto category can be valuable, even without immediate high revenue, as it suggests a future path to monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   **Data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>: Proprietary data accumulated across many customers can be monetized in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Partnerships & Distribution Channels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>: Working with tier-one companies or having exclusive distribution channels (e.g., through Fireblocks) can provide a clear path to future revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

Always raise capital with a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Don't be overly optimistic about short runways, as markets, trends, technology, and customer demand can change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

### 4. Do the One Thing That Matters
A founder's most challenging job is identifying and executing the one thing that will almost guarantee success, while excluding all other noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

Common pitfalls:
*   **Focusing on Features over Customers/Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>: For a Series A, investors seek customers, growth, AUM, and revenue, not just a beautiful product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Tech Debt instead of Shipping** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>: As a startup with limited runway, spending months refactoring backend code without delivering new features or acquiring customers can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Being Too Broad instead of Deep and Expert** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>: Trying to do three, four, or five different things, often with customized offerings for each customer, indicates a lack of scalable business and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

Align your team on the single mission that guarantees success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Don't just plan; act decisively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

### 5. Hire Slowly, Fire Quickly
Under pressure to grow, founders might hire too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. However, bringing on the wrong people causes more damage than not hiring at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. An eighth person in a company represents 12.5% of the company's operational capacity, and if they're not performing, it significantly impacts efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

*   **Maintain a High Bar** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>: "A players hire A players, but B players hire C players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. In a competitive crypto talent market, top engineers want to work in a challenging, motivated environment free of "dead weight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
*   **Act Decisively on Bad Hires** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>: Once you know a hire is wrong, act quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Avoid a revolving door by taking your time to hire the right person initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

### 6. Get Out of Stealth
Staying in stealth mode for too long is detrimental. The risk of irrelevance is far greater than the risk of someone copying your idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

Consequences of prolonged stealth:
*   **Lost Time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>: Spending 50% of your limited runway in stealth means you're not learning, iterating, talking to customers, advertising, or getting feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Excitement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>: You can't build excitement or momentum for launch if you can't discuss what you're building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **No Market Anchor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>: You lose the opportunity to define your company as the market leader or anchor against which others are measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

Examples of companies that got out of stealth effectively:
*   **Monad:** Built a community of hundreds of thousands globally before mainnet launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.
*   **Jito (Solana):** Quickly established itself as the MEV platform on Solana by building in the open and branding themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
*   **Photo Finish (Solana):** A virtual horse racing game that engaged its community through NFT mints and breeding events over a year, ensuring excitement for the game's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

Engage in "plus EV" Enterprise Value activities like building community, creating mini-games, doing quests, or appearing on podcasts to build excitement even before full product launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

## Product Building

### 7. Be Relentless About Finding Product Market Fit
Product Market Fit (PMF) is defined as finding repeatable cases of "hell yes" customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Repeatable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>: You need a single product that serves many customers in a defined market, rather than a customized solution for each.
*   **"Hell Yes"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>: Customers should be "pulling" your product, eager to sign up and use it, rather than you having to "push" it through sales pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

How to tell if you have PMF:
*   **Willingness to Pay** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>: If people still use your product when you charge for it, or even raise prices, it's a strong sign of PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. Founders often undercharge for products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
    *   **Pricing Strategy:** A good approach is to "double prices until somebody says no" to find true price discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
*   **Customer Evangelism** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>: Are your customers actively recommending your product to others? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>

Regarding market share vs. revenue: In growing markets, market share is often more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. For infrastructure companies during a bear market, focusing on increasing market share, even with low revenue, can pay off dramatically when the market recovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. However, do not assume you have product market fit if you aren't charging for your product, as people may only love it when it's free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.

### 8. Remember That Customers Lie
Do not directly ask customers what they want, as they often cannot articulate their true needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Instead, ask them:
*   **What do they do?** Understand their current processes and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.
*   **What are they trying to accomplish?** Identify their ultimate goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.

By observing their actions and goals, you can identify opportunities to build a better experience or a more direct path to their desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. Product intuition based on understanding customer needs is more valuable than direct requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

For seed-stage [[startups_in_crypto | startups]], avoid extensive A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. You have limited runway, so make decisions quickly, ship, and correct if wrong, rather than spending too much time on complex experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. This is why VCs value founder-market fit, as experienced founders already understand the market and necessary product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

### 9. Simplicity is More Important Than Complexity
"If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a> Anyone can design a complex product, but a truly great product strips away most things to offer one or two compelling experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. Elon Musk's first principle of product design is "make the requirements less dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. Peter Thiel advises to "do one thing uniquely well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>, which often requires a simple product.

Problems with complex products:
*   **Decreasing Customer Attention Span** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>: Users have very limited time for a product to make an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.
*   **Increased Technical Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>: Teams add features but rarely remove them, leading to engineers maintaining conflicting functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. Always think about how to simplify and cut features, even customers if they aren't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
*   **Unclear Value Proposition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>: A complex app obscures its core benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Simplicity drives clarity.
*   **Serving Too Many Customers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>: If your product is complex, you may be trying to serve too many customer segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.

How to gauge product complexity:
*   Can you describe your value proposition in two sentences (or 15 seconds)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>
*   Can customers have a "delight moment" within 60 seconds of onboarding? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>
*   Is there a singular, clear call to action above all others in the app? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>
*   Do you constantly add features without ever deprecating old ones? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>

### 10. Referrals Should Include the Core Value Proposition
In crypto, referral codes are popular, but they should be more than just a code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>. The referral process should immediately immerse new users in the product's core value proposition.

Example:
*   **Pay (private crypto Venmo):** To onboard, users had to be paid by someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. This immediately gave them a balance, unlocking the app's features (sending money, claiming points, interacting with DeFi), creating a far more compelling onboarding experience than starting with a zero balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.
*   **Betting App Example:** Instead of just signing up, a referral could involve someone sending you a bet to join, immediately putting you into the core experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

This ensures the user experiences the value immediately, rather than being overwhelmed by options or needing to figure out how to engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

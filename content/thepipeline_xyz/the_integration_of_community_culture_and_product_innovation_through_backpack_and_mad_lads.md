Backpack and its affiliated NFT project, Mad Lads, exemplify a unique strategy that integrates community culture and product innovation, creating a strong, engaged user base and driving significant growth in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Genesis and Early Community Building
Tristan, co-founder of Backpack, notes that Backpack and Monad share a similar genesis story, centered around [[importance_of_community_and_engagement_in_crypto_projects | building community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The initial approach involved "catching lightning in a bottle" and selectively filtering to find the best people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### The X NFT Mystery
The project launched without publicly revealing what X NFTs were—decentralized applications designed to run within the Backpack wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Early supporters, including figures like Anatoly, Raj, and Armani, changed their Twitter usernames to include "xnf," generating a significant air of mystery and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This organic buzz led to ~10,000 followers in the first month without any paid engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Curated Community Growth
To channel this energy, a private Discord was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Invitations were extended to individuals who demonstrated strong engagement through memes or insightful content, refining the community with "hardcore chronically online crypto addicts and meme Masters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. A specific GIF of an anime girl throwing a blue dodgeball became a public signal for Discord invites, triggering a "Cambrian explosion of memes" as people emulated the behavior to gain access, often assuming it was for an NFT project whitelist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### The "Blue Ball" Meme
The "blue ball" meme emerged from this period, combining the imagery of the blue dodgeball GIF with the frustration of the community being "blue balled" by the mystery of X NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This meme further amplified engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Mad Lads: Cultural Backbone and Innovation Showcase
Recognizing the importance of culture alongside product, the team decided to launch an NFT collection, Mad Lads, to serve as the "cultural backbone" for the growing community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The early Discord members, aligned with the team's vision, became the torchbearers of this culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The Mad Lads collection also served as a showcase for the X NFT technology, demonstrating how an NFT could also be an application, offering a new depth of experience in the NFT space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### Community Engagement Through Wallet Games
Backpack used its wallet as a tool for [[integrating_social_and_financial_elements_in_cryptocommunities | community engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, creating games within the locked wallet interface where users could win invite codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Examples include:
*   **AI Prompt Guessing:** Users guessed the AI prompts used to generate images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Animal Sound Guessing:** Users identified animal sounds played in the extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Minecraft Map Navigation:** A Minecraft map was created where users found hidden codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

This experiential approach fostered a community that cared beyond financial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Founders and team members from other crypto projects even participated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

## Iterative Product Development and the Exchange
The transition from X NFT to Mad Lads and eventually the exchange was an iterative process, not fully pre-planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. The team, drawing on decades of experience in [[building_and_growing_a_digital_community_around_mad_lads_and_nft | digital community building]] from games like RuneScape and forums, recognized opportunities to channel energy as they emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Mad Lads Mint Experience
The Mad Lads mint itself was designed as a unique in-wallet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. Whitelist claims and the public mint were conducted directly within the Backpack wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. Post-mint, users played a game to "defeat the Mad King" within the wallet to "unrug" their Mad Lads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. This generated significant hype, attracting users from across the crypto ecosystem beyond just Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. It occurred during a crypto bear market (Q1 2023), providing a source of positive energy for the Solana ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

### The Backpack Exchange
The decision to launch an exchange arose from a serendipitous meeting between Backpack's co-founder Armani and a leading crypto regulatory and licensing expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. They recognized a gap left by FTX and decided to merge their expertise: Backpack's strong engineering, marketing, and community, with the lawyer's regulatory knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. The exchange was built in 6-7 months and launched in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

#### Regulatory Approach and Innovation
Backpack Exchange is notable for its commitment to being fully regulated and compliant from day one, being the first to receive the Vara full retail cryptocurrency exchange license in Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Unlike many exchanges that start as "cowboys" and backtrack into regulation, Backpack prioritized this from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

The exchange's architecture is innovative, built as a permissioned blockchain with different validators running instances of the same exchange. This design allows for transaction replayability and could eventually involve external trusted parties (e.g., regulators) running validators, ensuring no single point of failure or modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. They are also building out a ZK proof of reserves system for verifiable fund security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

Backpack aims to find a middle ground between highly compliant entities like Coinbase (US-focused) and agile, crypto-native ones like Binance (international, historically less compliant), combining careful regulatory adherence with a nimble product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

#### Synergistic Ecosystem: Wallet, Mad Lads, and Exchange
Backpack creates a cohesive user experience by integrating its non-custodial wallet (for on-chain activity) and the exchange (for off-chain activity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. Users can seamlessly move Fiat to gas tokens and engage with both centralized and decentralized crypto activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

The Mad Lads community serves as the "top of funnel"—super fans and super users who provide attention, eyeballs, and valuable feedback as beta testers for new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

> "If you have a spectrum and on one end you have coinbase who is this like Paragon of compliance and responsibility and and has gone public it's a public company in the United States IT services the majority of the US at this point but doesn't do very much internationally and then on the other end of the spectrum you have binance who came out 2017 clawed market share by being the fastest most Crypton native team that put the products that the people wanted out into the world but didn't really put too much attention or energy into the compliance regulatory thing for a long time and then we're somewhere in the middle where we are very careful on the compliance and Regulatory side so that every conversation we have with a regulator is from a place of trust and knowing that we don't have skeletons in our closet which makes it much much easier in our approach to gaining new licenses but with a very Crypton native Nimble product team that is able to adjust and spin out things as we see that we need them to grow and attract the user base within the crypto space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>

### International Focus
The team decided to move out of the US regulatory environment early on, recognizing Asia as a hub of crypto activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. Japan was chosen among options like Hong Kong and Singapore due to an existing team member working on licensing, the supportive regulatory environment that consistently moves towards being web3-friendly, and Japan's significant GDP, which correlates with crypto trading volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

### Exchange Launch and Growth
The Backpack Exchange was rushed into launching in November due to a partnership with Pyth Network for their Token Generation Event (TGE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. This launch event, which offered 10 million Pyth tokens, went viral, especially in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. It resulted in 140,000 KYC users in the first week and 74,000 participants in the Pyth drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. Although it "broke everything" and involved 10 days of non-stop work, it hardened the team and improved all systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

Subsequent growth included:
*   **Point System:** Launched in February, generating absurd spot volume. Between Feb 13 and March 18, $27.5 billion in spot volume was traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Wormhole Drop:** 27 million Wormhole tokens were distributed to 300,000 traders from the first snapshot, driving growth and distributing tokens to new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.
*   **Record Volume:** Hit $8.6 billion in spot volume on a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
*   **User Onboarding:** The exchange has approximately 350,000 active traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

Backpack consistently sees higher organic spot trading volumes between major events, indicating sustained user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. They plan to continue expanding product offerings, including Bitcoin, Ethereum (ERC-20s), and Futures trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

A key aspect is driving their centralized exchange users, many of whom are new to the on-chain world, to interact with decentralized protocols. For example, for the Tensor token drop, users had to connect their wallet and make a trade on Tensor, resulting in a significant influx of new unique wallet addresses to the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. Unlike many exchanges that aim to keep users contained, Backpack encourages users to engage with the wider on-chain world, ideally using Backpack Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

## The Role of Memes and Culture in Crypto
Tristan emphasizes that in crypto, projects are "doomed to fail" if they take themselves too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. [[the_role_of_memes_and_art_in_creating_community_engagement | Crypto Twitter]] drives storytelling and requires entertainment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>. The viral "bean bag picture" of the Backpack team is a prime example of this strategy, garnering millions of impressions and permeating internet meme culture by appealing to both "left" and "right curve" audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. The Mad Lads team intentionally told their community "no utility, this is a rug, send it to zero" to manage expectations and encourage enjoyment of the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.

</div>

## Future Outlook
Tristan is excited about continuing to grow the exchange and wallet, aiming for Backpack to become a mainstay international cryptocurrency exchange and one of the largest exchanges in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. This ambition requires "infinite amounts of work" but the team is committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.

One of the key takeaways from being a podcast host, particularly in the crypto space, is the value of organic and free-flowing conversation over highly structured interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03">[01:03]</a>.

## Lessons from Up Only

Early on, the Up Only podcast hosts attempted a more structured approach, preparing specific questions about products and topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14">[01:14]</a>. However, they found that their best shows occurred when they simply "jammed" on topics without sticking to prepared questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28">[01:28]</a>. This free-flowing dynamic, where conversations evolve naturally, proved to be key to producing compelling content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>.

The hosts affirmed that they "never really planned too far ahead" and that the podcast was "best when it was organic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51">[08:51]</a>. This organic approach allowed for genuine interactions and discussions, which are difficult to replicate through rigid planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15">[10:15]</a>.

## Benefits of an Organic Approach

*   **Authenticity**: Unscripted conversations allow for more genuine and authentic dialogue between hosts and guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>.
*   **Depth and Richness**: When hosts and guests feel comfortable letting the conversation flow freely, it can lead to deeper insights and more engaging discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30">[01:30]</a>.
*   **Unique Dynamic**: The natural dynamic between hosts is challenging for others to replicate, contributing to a unique listening experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19">[10:19]</a>.

This approach aligns with the broader [[importance_of_starting_and_practicing_in_content_creation | challenges and insights from growing a crypto podcast]], where fostering [[importance_of_community_and_engagement_in_crypto_projects | culture]] and [[the_importance_of_networking_and_community_connections_in_cryptocurrency | connections]] is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04">[02:04]</a>.

### Beyond the Podcast

The hosts also touched on broader themes, such as the [[importance_of_sharing_your_business_message | challenges and insights from growing a crypto podcast]] in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50">[01:50]</a>, and the difficulty for others to fill the void of a [[challenges_and_insights_from_growing_a_crypto_podcast | crypto culture podcast]] that operated with such an organic dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52">[09:52]</a>.

The discussion highlighted that some of the most impactful content comes from unforced, genuine exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>. This principle is not only applicable to podcasting but also to creating value in broader contexts, including the development of [[importance_of_community_in_crypto_projects | culture]] within crypto projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32">[16:32]</a> and [[importance_of_community_building_in_nft_projects | NFT communities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52">[16:52]</a>.

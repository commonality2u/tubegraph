## Axelar's Interchain Token Service (ITS)

Axelar offers an Interchain Token Service (ITS), currently in beta, which aims to be a code-free and permissionless solution for tokenization and bridging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This service allows individuals, even those without coding knowledge, to launch tokens or meme coins and enable them for cross-chain functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

Key features and benefits of ITS include:
*   **Multi-chain launch from day one** Developers can launch a token on multiple chains instantly, with the ability to scale to any future chain supported by Axelar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **Reduced fragmentation** By building all logic on one chain (e.g., Monad) and using Axelar for connectivity, applications can avoid fragmentation, consolidate users, and simplify development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Permissionless and Decentralized** ITS aligns with crypto's ethos, allowing anyone to take their token cross-chain in minutes without requiring developer expertise or permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. This power of decentralization and permissionless access has already led to successful meme coin launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

As an example, Frax has partnered with Axelar to issue Frax assets on chains not supported by their native Frax Ferry bridge, and on all future chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. This demonstrates a shift where projects recognize the rapid evolution of [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | cross-chain]] environments and rely on specialized platforms like Axelar for asset issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## [[future_of_crypto_applications_and_use_cases | Future Use Cases]] and Trends in Interoperability

The field of [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | cross-chain communication]] is still early, with current use cases heavily focused on asset transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. However, there's a strong expectation for exponential growth in [[future_potential_use_cases_for_crypto_and_blockchain | cross-chain transactions]] and message passing as the number of chains rapidly increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

> "I think then what we see today on a single chain, there will be a cross-chain version of that... and on top of that, there'll be like new unique use cases that we haven't really even thought of yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

Specific [[future_potential_use_cases_for_crypto_and_blockchain | future use cases]] are expected to mirror existing single-chain applications but with cross-chain capabilities, such as:
*   Cross-chain DEXs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   Cross-chain money markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
*   Cross-chain NFT marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>
*   Cross-chain swaps (similar to single-chain DEX evolution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>

### Evolution of Builder and User Perspective

The perspective of builders and users regarding [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | cross-chain]] functionality has evolved significantly. A year ago, teams were content building on a single chain, but now the immediate conversation revolves around launching on multiple chains (two or three) with plans for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This shift is due to the rapid movement of liquidity and users across various chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, making it necessary to plan for a [[future_of_the_crypto_industry_and_interoperability | cross-chain world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

### Enabling Factors for Growth

Two primary factors are seen as critical for the expansion of [[future_potential_use_cases_for_crypto_and_blockchain | cross-chain]] use cases:
1.  **Lower Gas Fees** Cross-chain gas fees are currently high, encompassing costs on the source chain, destination chain, and relay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. As scaling solutions reduce these costs, [[future_potential_use_cases_for_crypto_and_blockchain | cross-chain transactions]] will become cheaper and more accessible, leading to increased volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
2.  **Instant Finality** Chains with instant finality, such as Monad, are crucial for building efficient cross-chain applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Current delays (15-20 minutes for Ethereum, longer for L2s due to block verification) hinder user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. With instant finality, messages can pass much faster (60-90 seconds), significantly improving the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### Interoperability as an Embedded Layer

Rather than being a "killer use case" itself, [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] is viewed as a fundamental layer that will make Web3 as usable as Web2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. It will be integrated into virtually every application across DeFi, gaming, real-world asset tokenization, and NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

The goal is to abstract away the complexities of different blockchains from the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. For example, if an asset is on Solana and an application on Arbitrum, the user ideally shouldn't need to know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. The wallet should handle asset location and present a unified balance, using [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] infrastructure to seamlessly pass messages across networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

Axelar's architecture, particularly the Axelar Virtual Machine, is seen as uniquely positioned to support this future where [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability]] is ubiquitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

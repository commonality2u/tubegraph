The Kizzy app is described as one of the "coolest apps in all of crypto" focused on social media, functioning as a platform for daily [[developments_and_features_in_social_media_betting | prediction markets]] where users can engage with their favorite teams, influencers, and online content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13"></a>. The concept of [[developments_and_features_in_social_media_betting | social media betting]] itself is intriguing, and the app's foundation is built on the belief that it could become one of the world's largest applications, akin to the current scale of sports betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21"></a>. The Monad TestNet has provided a perfect environment for Kizzy to experiment with and introduce this new form of betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54"></a>.

## Inspiration and Background
Kizzy's inspiration stems from the founder's background in video games and the emergence of play-to-earn gaming, which initially drew them into crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17"></a>. Although early experiences with play-to-earn were likened to "Ponzi's" where money was lost, the founder was captivated by the underlying technology of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51"></a>. Spending increasing time in the space led to forming online communities and finding co-founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20"></a>. After exploring a few ideas, the team eventually landed on Kizzy, which they have been developing for nearly two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38"></a>. The name "Kizzy" itself was chosen for its catchy, memorable, and unique quality, with the philosophy "no kids no Ky" being a popular saying that resonated with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:42"></a>.

## Key Features and Updates
Kizzy has undergone significant updates, including the launch of Season One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05"></a>.
Key features and updates include:
*   **Gamification and Engagement** Season One introduced features like a mission center and ranking systems, making the app feel more like a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12"></a>. Users can progress by applying their knowledge of social media to make correct predictions on creators and influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20"></a>.
*   **Expanded Creator Base** More creators and influencers, including popular Monad community figures, have been added to the platform, enhancing engagement with their users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28"></a>. More YouTube creators are planned for a close update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:11"></a>.
*   **New Game Modes** In the coming weeks and months, Kizzy plans to release new game modes that will significantly enhance the app's entertainment factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37"></a>.
*   **Multi-Platform Integration** While starting with Twitter as its initial wedge for web3 users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42"></a>, Kizzy aims to become the home of [[developments_and_features_in_social_media_betting | social media betting]] across various platforms including Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Kick. However, adding new markets and oracles takes time and bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22"></a>.
*   **Live Stream Betting** The vision includes being able to bet live on streaming metrics like concurrent viewership on platforms such as Twitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42"></a>.
*   **Creator Listing Process** To maintain trust and prevent market manipulation, Kizzy employs a curated listing process for creators. This involves reviewing engagement and views to ensure markets are engaging for users while protecting against risks associated with social media influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20"></a>. This is likened to sports betting apps only allowing bets on major league games, not high school games, to build confidence in the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41"></a>.
*   **Testnet Deposits** Deposits into the Kizzy app will soon be enabled, allowing users to join with their testnet Monad tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:59"></a>. This can provide a significant boost to a user's ELO leaderboard and rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12"></a>.
*   **Potential Non-Monetary Custom Betting Lines** The team is considering adding a "free-to-play" or non-monetary model for custom betting lines, allowing users to create permissionless markets for smaller profiles using testnet tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:14"></a>. This would allow friends to bet on their own circles and smaller creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:39"></a>.

## User Experience and Design Philosophy
Kizzy emphasizes a high standard for [[innovations_in_user_experience_for_betting_platforms | UI/UX and user experience]], with one of the co-founders being a designer by trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54"></a>. The app aims for a web2-level user experience on blockchain rails, rejecting crypto benchmarks as "good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:20"></a>. The goal is for the app to be so intuitive that on mainnet, anyone can download it and start playing within 30 seconds, without needing any web3 knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:28"></a>. The app is optimized for speed, with quick transaction times (under 15-20 seconds) and an integrated faucet, making the on-chain experience feel seamless to the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10"></a>. This snappy and crisp experience is a key reason for building on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:43"></a>.

## Popular Markets
The most popular markets on Kizzy currently involve globally recognized figures like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Mr. Beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11"></a>. Additionally, there's high engagement with popular creators and influencers within the crypto, web3, and Monad niches, such as Kona and smaller creators like KB or King Louie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23"></a>. This dichotomy allows for betting on both universally known personalities and figures where users might have specific knowledge, fandom, or tribal connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51"></a>.

## Future Outlook
Kizzy aims to continue pushing the concept of [[developments_and_features_in_social_media_betting | social media betting]] forward with more platforms, games, and creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52"></a>. The transition from testnet to mainnet is a key focus, with plans to introduce models that appeal to both monetary and non-monetary players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:11"></a>. The goal is to achieve mass market growth by providing a seamless, mass-adoption-ready application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:57"></a>.

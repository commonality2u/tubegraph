Maintaining a positive reputation in the crypto space is crucial for both individuals and companies, leading to trust, opportunities, and long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>. Pancakes_BR, known as the "goat of Good Vibes on crypto Twitter," shares his insights on how authenticity, empathy, and a long-term vision contribute to building and preserving a strong standing within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The "Good Vibes" Approach

Initially, Pancakes_BR's online persona was "aggro joking" but he eventually found success by "just being himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He consciously decided to shed a persona and remain "as genuine and honest as possible," discovering this to be a "growth hack to [[networking_and_the_importance_of_community_in_crypto | networking]] in the space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This approach allowed him to avoid constant conflict, which is common in the often "cutthroat" crypto environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:13">[02:02:13]</a>.

Instead of fighting with everyone, his strategy became to be "very genuine and kind and and empathetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. He recommends being "light-hearted about everything" and not taking things too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.

## Building Trust and Relationships

For Pancakes_BR, sticking with it and being a part of the [[networking_and_the_importance_of_community_in_crypto | community]] was key to his retention in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. He describes how old-timers in the space respect small accounts that remain engaged and positive during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. Emotional control is highlighted as a significant advantage for anyone in crypto, whether a trader, networker, or business development professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

Key actions that helped him build trust include:
*   **"Reply guying" heavily:** Engaging with important figures and followers through replies, being funny, nice, or "obnoxiously stupid on purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This helped him gain hundreds of followers daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Meeting people in real life:** Knowing anonymous accounts and company representatives in person fosters greater trust and respect than purely online interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Engaging with followers:** Replying to comments and DMs, especially early on, establishes you as an engaged [[the_importance_of_community_in_blockchain_projects | community]] member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. People remember and respect this engagement, leading to higher interaction rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

## Avoiding Negative Behaviors

A critical aspect of maintaining a positive reputation is avoiding negative actions:
*   **No "paid shills":** Despite being "super broke" and needing money, Pancakes_BR turned down paid promotions because he intuitively felt it wouldn't be a good idea for the long game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. He believed better opportunities would arise by not selling his reputation for short-term gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   **No infighting or tribalism:** He strongly advocates against arguing on the timeline and creating enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>. The crypto space is too small to be divided by "tribalism" and infighting, especially when the goal is broader adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>. The mindset should be "we are all on the same team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.
*   **No grifting:** The [[importance_of_community_in_the_nft_space | NFT]] bull run, while bringing in new people, also saw a lot of "grifting," which has "extremely put off" powerful mainstream individuals from the entire crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. Avoiding such practices is crucial for the industry's overall reputation.

## Long-term vs. Short-term Thinking

Pancakes_BR emphasizes that the difference between short-term and [[the_importance_of_conviction_and_longterm_vision_in_crypto | long-term thinking]] is "huge and extremely underrated" in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>. His decision to remain broke and avoid paid shills was a long-term play that ultimately led to significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

A long-term perspective also means being grateful for followers and not seeing oneself as an "influencer that deserves anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Your followers are the reason for your relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.

## Impact on Career and Opportunities

A positive reputation directly translates into career opportunities. Pancakes_BR's job offers came during a bear market because he had built a network and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. His first job at IDEX, which saved him when he was nearly out of money, was a direct result of his established online presence and genuine interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

He highlights that if people trust you in the space, "the opportunities are unlimited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>. The crypto community values what you can deliver and your ability to "pivot and learn quickly" over traditional credentials or resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:40">[02:20:40]</a>.

## Advice for Newcomers

For those looking to enter crypto or deepen their involvement, Pancakes_BR advises:

*   **Be willing to learn and provide value for free:** Find ways to be useful, even if it's as a community manager for a Discord server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

## Company Perspective

Companies in crypto also benefit immensely from maintaining a positive and authentic presence. Pancakes_BR notes that successful protocols understand the culture and audience of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:48">[02:45:48]</a>.
*   **Authentic Personality:** People prefer to follow a personality over just a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. Protocols should have a human being behind their social media accounts who "is good at Twitter and and can just really just be a person behind your your your logo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:26">[02:27:26]</a>.
*   **Understand the Culture:** Companies that try to be "hyper professional" and don't engage in the "fun meme culture" of crypto struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:47">[02:11:47]</a>. Crypto audiences are "put off by tourists or like corporate" approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:07">[02:53:07]</a>.
*   **Reading the Room:** Being part of the [[the_importance_of_community_in_blockchain_projects | community]] allows a company's team to understand the prevailing sentiment on the timeline, whether it's a time for empathy or self-deprecating humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:29">[03:22:29]</a>. This ensures communication resonates genuinely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:25">[03:24:25]</a>.
*   **Hiring Community-Native People:** Hiring ambassadors or marketers who are already part of and understand the community is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:09">[03:11:09]</a>. Founders who have built trust within the community have a higher chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:17">[03:22:17]</a>.

Pancakes_BR acknowledges that companies like Monad have successfully created a "community that like rides for you in a genuine way" by hiring the right people who are liked on the timeline and by having founders who understand the importance of this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:57">[04:57:57]</a>.

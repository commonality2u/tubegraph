Value-driven marketing shifts the focus from promoting a business's internal attributes to providing genuine value for its audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This approach aims to create a different dynamic with viewers by offering content that is either informative or entertaining, making the product or service a secondary element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Contrasting with Traditional Promotion

Traditional business promotion often centers on self-praise, detailing a company's offerings and internal qualities. For instance, a sandwich shop might create a commercial highlighting its use of organically sourced vegetables and high-quality meats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This "me me me" approach primarily focuses on what the business does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Implementing Value-driven Content

Instead of self-promotion, businesses should create content that provides utility or enjoyment to their target audience. The key is to position the content in a way where the [[audiencefirst_approach_in_business_marketing | audience is first]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. When creating content to promote a business, the primary consideration should be the value that can be provided to other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Sandwich Shop Case Study
> A sandwich shop, rather than making a commercial about its ingredients, could create a series on the "best places to go on a picnic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The content would showcase different picnic locations, providing valuable information or entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The sandwich itself would merely be included in the content as a "byproduct," subtly mentioned while the main focus remains on providing value to the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This strategy shifts the dynamic, as the business is giving value first, making its product a natural fit within the helpful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The [[Monad public test net launch | Monad public test net]] is officially live, providing an environment for users to interact with the Monad ecosystem [00:00:02]. This guide outlines the steps to perform transactions and explore applications on the test net.

## Accessing the Test Net
To begin, navigate to the Monad test net landing page. This can be done by visiting `testnet.monad.xyz` or, for existing community members, `monadtest.phantom.me` for a Phantom wallet experience [00:00:12].

## Connecting Your Wallet
The first step on the landing page is to [[connecting_wallets_to_monad_test_net | connect your wallet]] [00:00:36].
Some wallets offer native test net support, while others may require manual network addition [00:00:40]. Even if manual addition is needed, a button is available to auto-add the test net to wallets like MetaMask in a single step [00:00:47].

## Obtaining Test Net Tokens
Before making transactions, you will need test net tokens, which can be acquired via the faucet [00:01:04]. To do this:
1.  Paste your public address into the designated field [00:01:10].
2.  Click "Get Testnet Monad" [00:01:12].
The amount of tokens claimable may vary based on certain parameters, and the faucet refreshes throughout the day, so users are encouraged to check daily [00:01:17].

## Making Your First Trade
Once test net tokens are in your wallet, you can make your first trade [00:01:29]. The landing page facilitates trading three meme coins: House of Mandac, House of Makaki, and House of Chog [00:01:37]. These trades are enabled by Blinks by Dialect and powered by Uniswap [00:01:44].

## Exploring Other Applications
Beyond initial trades, the Monad test net features a variety of experiences available from day one [00:02:07].
Featured applications include:
*   Fantasy Top (with a tournament scheduled to start the day after launch) [00:02:12].
*   Rare Bet [00:02:21].
*   Sports 42 [00:02:23].
*   KY Kuru [00:02:24].
*   Curv [00:02:25].
*   ANS [00:02:26].

Additionally, an ecosystem directory, located below the featured apps, will be continually updated throughout the test net phase with new apps and experiences [00:02:31]. This directory is recommended as the primary source for finding new activities on the [[Monad public test net launch | Monad public test net]] [00:02:41].

## Purpose of the Test Net and Community Engagement
The primary purpose of the test net is to deploy new application experiences and test them in a lower-stakes, lower-risk environment [00:03:00]. Users are encouraged to try out various dApps and provide feedback to the development teams [00:02:58].

Community momentum is expected to grow around Monad and its ecosystem projects [00:03:10]. All community members are encouraged to get active and build, regardless of their backgroundâ€”whether as an artist, technical expert, developer, video creator, or "spaces yapper" [00:03:17]. The Monad ecosystem aims to provide opportunities for everyone to become a thought leader [00:03:30].

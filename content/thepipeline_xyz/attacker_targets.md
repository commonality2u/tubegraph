Attackers typically aim for three primary objectives when targeting individuals or entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

## Primary Objectives

*   **Funds**
    Attackers seek funds stored on-chain, on centralized exchanges (CEXs), or within various wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Access**
    Attackers may seek to gain [[access_vulnerabilities | access]] to an individual's accounts or systems to use them as an interception point to reach others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This could involve leveraging the compromised individual's trusted position to target colleagues, friends, or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For example, if a public figure's account is compromised, attackers could use that leverage in a [[social_engineering_and_phishing_attacks | spear phishing campaign]] or employ [[social_engineering_tactics | social engineering tactics]] to gain access to others, such as by sending malicious meeting invitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Data**
    Sensitive credentials and other data are also targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Any location where sensitive credentials are stored must be rigorously audited for security vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Mitigation Strategy

Individuals must have a clear understanding of all potential points of failure in their digital and personal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This involves inventorying these vulnerabilities and [[creating an attack surface map | creating an attack surface map]] to identify all areas of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Once identified, these points should be continually tweaked and mitigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

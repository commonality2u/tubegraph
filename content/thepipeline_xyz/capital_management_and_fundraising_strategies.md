Carl, a partner at Six-man Ventures, an [[earlystage_crypto_investment_strategies | early-stage crypto fund]] founded in 2021, emphasizes that building enterprise value and a company is more crucial than solely focusing on product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. He notes that while first-time founders often prioritize product, experienced founders understand the importance of distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The ultimate goal for founders should be to create enterprise value for themselves, their employees, and the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Most founders typically spend 70% to 80% of their time on product-related activities, but Carl argues they should allocate more time to [[decisionmaking_for_crypto_founders | company building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Pillars of Company Building

Carl outlines several critical aspects of [[decisionmaking_for_crypto_founders | company building]] that are vital for success:

### Cash Management
Effective cash management is paramount for any founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The primary reason companies fail is running out of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Founders must be meticulous about where cash is stored, how much they have, and their burn rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### [[fundraising_for_crypto_projects | Fundraising]] for a Massive Financial Outcome
Companies succeed or fail based on their ability to articulate a compelling vision to the right investors who can provide the necessary capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Significant time must be dedicated to this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

If founders accept [[venture_capital_impact_on_crypto_development | Venture Capital]] dollars, they must optimize for a massive financial outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. As a venture investor, Carl seeks a path to a 100x investment, especially in pre-seed stages, as a 10x return is not sufficiently interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

#### Avoiding Early Dilution
A common pitfall for teams is over-diluting equity too early in the business's lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. For instance, raising $2 million on a $10 million valuation results in 20% dilution, which is acceptable for a first round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. However, subsequent large dilutions can make it challenging to attract significant Series A investors seeking meaningful ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Carl strongly advises against excessive dilution in consecutive rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

#### Prioritizing the Right Partners Over Valuation
Founders should not excessively worry about a few percentage points in valuation if it means securing the right partners who can contribute to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Building a business, especially one aiming for a billion-dollar outcome, is incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Carl suggests that founders might opt for a lower valuation to bring in a Tier 1 investor, even if a Tier 2 or 3 investor offers a higher valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The marginal difference in personal financial outcome for the founder (e.g., 5% less) is less significant than the increased chance of success with strategic partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. For investors, that valuation difference can represent a substantial 25% return difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. The focus should be on optimizing for a massive financial outcome, not marginal valuation differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### Goal of Capital: Create Enterprise Value
The purpose of raising capital is to create enterprise value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The milestone to aim for is not just building a product, but delivering tangible enterprise value that justifies future capital raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Product Managers focus on products, but CEOs must focus on enterprise value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:15:01]</a>.

Enterprise value can take various forms:
*   **Revenue:** The most clear and powerful form of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Brand Awareness:** Being recognized as a leader in a specific crypto category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   **Data:** Proprietary data accumulated from many customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Partnerships:** Collaborations with Tier 1 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
*   **Distribution Channels:** Exclusive access to large user bases or platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Founders should consider the enterprise value they need to create for their next funding round and then back into the capital required to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

#### Raising with a Margin of Safety
Always raise capital with a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Relying on a small amount for only six months of runway is overly optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Markets, meta trends, technology, and customer demand can change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Building in extra runway is crucial, as planning down to the week or sprint is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### Role of Advisors and VCs
While some [[venture_capital_impact_on_crypto_development | VCs]] believe advisory tokens should not be given, Carl suggests there's a place for advisors if they provide specific, tangible value, especially when tied to vesting obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>. For example, an advisor who can provide access to specific industry connections (e.g., game studios) can be invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>. However, dedicating 4% to 5% of tokens for advisors seems excessively high; founders might be better off converting that value into additional runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

Regarding the balance between market share and revenue, Carl generally biases towards market share in growing markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Companies that maintained or grew market share during bear markets, even without significant revenue, often saw substantial revenue growth when the market recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. However, he cautions against assuming product-market fit if users are not willing to pay for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

Regarding bootstrapping versus raising capital, Carl advises bootstrapping for as long as possible to minimize dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. However, raising capital becomes strategic when:
*   It helps accelerate scaling once product-market fit is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.
*   Specific connections or advice are needed that would be difficult to obtain otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>. An external, respected capital allocator's check can provide credibility and connections that accelerate the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>.

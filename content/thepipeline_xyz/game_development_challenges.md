Creating a game is considered harder than creating an on-chain game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The primary bottleneck in game development is [[creating a good game | creating a good game]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Prioritizing Fun Gameplay
The main challenge in gaming is to first create a fun game before incorporating on-chain components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. An example given is Roblox: it gained popularity as a game before non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The speaker suggests that adding asset tracking or NFTs makes sense *after* the core game is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Addressing In-Game Asset Security
There's an existing dynamic where gamers trade items like CS:GO skins or use gray markets for RuneScape gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. These activities, which have been ongoing for over 15 years, often result in users being scammed due to insecure methods like wire transfers to anonymous parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This highlights a need for more secure asset management systems in gaming, which blockchain technology could potentially address despite its own perceived security challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

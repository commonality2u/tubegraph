## The Importance of Conviction

A crucial aspect of navigating the crypto industry is maintaining conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a>. Many ideas that initially appear "crazy" or "ridiculous" are eventually proven correct years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04"></a>. For instance, the belief that Bitcoin would be used for payments was a common thought process around 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>. While that specific application isn't viewed in the same way now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17"></a>, the underlying thesis has materialized through stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20"></a>.

Remaining steadfast in crypto involves having conviction, enduring challenging periods, and persistently building, even when events might lead to a loss of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24"></a>.

Markets are dynamic, and one "absolutely should adapt" to changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a>. The key is to remain true to the "core thesis" and "core beliefs" that underpin one's involvement in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40"></a>.

When asked what word friends would use to describe them, the individual initially stated, "I don't know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, they later suggested "Baker," noting, "I'm a good Baker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The question posed to prompt this [[describing_personal_attributes | personal attribute description]] was: "if your friends could describe you in one word what would they say?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This question was repeated later in the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

When faced with a hypothetical choice between losing all personal money or all memories, one individual stated they would choose to lose all their money "every time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The rationale provided for this decision is that money can be earned back "easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, whereas lost memories, representing "those years," are irrecoverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Kevin, known as "intern," leads ecosystem growth at [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] is an upcoming blockchain (L1) that is highly anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Community-Centric Philosophy
A key aspect of [[community_and_team_growth_at_monad | Monad]]'s strategy is its strong focus on community, distinguishing it from traditional B2B or B2B2C models where the end-user might be less of a direct focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. In the crypto space, particularly for Layer 1s (L1s) and NFTs, the "social layer" is considered paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. As Mert puts it, "an L1 is just a shared computer for a community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, meaning the users on a chain like Ethereum or Solana constitute its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

### Working "In" the Community
[[the_role_of_community_in_monads_development | Monad]] emphasizes working "in" the community rather than "on" it, highlighting the importance of team members being active participants and wanting to be part of their own community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This approach helps the team understand how everything operates within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The team, including Kevin, dedicates time daily to engage in Discord and make friends with community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

This community-first strategy has yielded positive externalities:
*   The [[early_days_of_the_monad_community | Monad community]] is known for being very vocal and creative, with many artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   The podcast itself originated from a community member's idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
*   A strong social layer attracts high-quality partners who recognize its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   Community engagement creates a "flywheel" effect, attracting partnerships and builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. For example, some partners were drawn in after seeing 40 original art comments on a [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   The collaborative and friendly nature of [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] and Wormhole is valued by users and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

## Growth and Partnerships

### Wormhole Collaboration
[[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] is working closely with Wormhole, especially concerning bridging solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The initial launch and bridge for [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] are expected to be significantly different and cleaner than early L1s in 2021, thanks to advancements in bridging standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The bridging experience will be a user's first interaction with [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]], making its success crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The collaboration between [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] and Wormhole was evident during "Wormhole Wednesday," where the [[early_days_of_the_monad_community | Monad community]] actively participated in Wormhole's Discord and created joint art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Wormhole has learned from [[the_role_of_community_in_monads_development | Monad]]'s approach to community building, focusing on making friends and adding value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

### Strategic Positioning
[[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] takes a uniquely non-competitive stance towards other chains like Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. Instead of aiming for a takeover, [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] seeks to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and enable new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] views itself as an "expansion and supplementation" to the EVM ecosystem, fostering friendly relations with Ethereum and L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

[[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] aims to unlock new use cases for the EVM by being fast and cheap, similar to how Solana enables applications impossible on the current EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. This includes enabling applications like sports betting with very low fees (e.g., sub five cents per transaction), making them objectively better than Web2 solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

Given that most crypto developers (around 95%) use Solidity and the EVM holds the majority of total value locked (TVL), [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] seeks to bring high-throughput, low-fee environments to this large developer and capital base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. The success of chains like Solana validates [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]]'s thesis, as it shows the demand for high-throughput, low-fee environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

The overarching goal in crypto is to "grow the pie" by bringing in new users and developers, rather than simply moving them between existing ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. [[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]]'s focus on building for customers and expanding the overall crypto economy is seen as a very bullish signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.

## Future Outlook
[[introduction_to_monad_and_its_community | Monad]] has generated significant attention, and the team is excited about upcoming technical updates and progress that will demonstrate the "meat and potatoes" of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. The project is seen as having massive product-market fit due to its simple yet powerful value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

Creating a game is considered harder than creating an on-chain game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The primary bottleneck for gaming is the creation of a good, fun game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is suggested that developers should first focus on making a fun game and then integrate [[integrating_games_with_blockchain | components of it on chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The integration of [[the_role_of_nfts_and_asset_ownership_in_gaming | NFTs]] and asset tracking makes sense for existing successful games like Roblox, which was developed first before considering such additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Addressing Existing Game Economies

Gamers currently engage in trading activities, such as trading CS:GO skins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Additionally, a gray market for RuneScape gold has existed for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Users in these unofficial markets often face scams, resorting to insecure methods like wire transfers to anonymous individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These existing behaviors highlight a potential use case for [[potential_for_crypto_in_payments_and_gaming | crypto]] and [[the_role_of_nfts_and_asset_ownership_in_gaming | NFTs]] to provide a more secure and reliable system for asset ownership and exchange within games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

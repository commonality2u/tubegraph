Cryptocurrency wallets come in two primary forms: hot wallets and cold wallets. The main [[differences_between_hot_and_cold_wallets | distinction]] lies in their connection to the internet, which impacts their [[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | user security in cryptocurrency]] and convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Cold Wallets

A cold wallet is a method to store funds where the private keys are kept offline, meaning they are not connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This offline nature makes them "cold storage," providing a high level of [[security_of_cold_wallets | security]] as hackers cannot easily gain access to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Cold wallets are significantly more secure than hot wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Best Practices for Cold Wallets

While highly secure, cold wallets require users to take extra steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Always back up your recovery phrase or keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   Never store your recovery phrase or keys online, as this would negate the purpose of a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Store them in a safe place, ideally on a piece of paper, and consider a fireproof location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Ensure you know exactly where they are stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Hot Wallets

A hot wallet is "hot" because it is live and continuously connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The primary benefit of a hot wallet is its [[convenience_of_hot_wallets | convenience]] and ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. They are often utilized by traders who need to quickly move funds on-chain and off-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Risks of Hot Wallets

The primary downside of hot wallets is their increased vulnerability to compromise due to their internet connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It is much more likely that a hot wallet will be compromised compared to a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

> [!warning] Precaution
> Due to the [[risks_of_using_hot_wallets | risks of using hot wallets]], it is crucial never to keep too much cryptocurrency in a hot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

The primary distinction between a hot wallet and a cold wallet lies in their connection to the internet and the security implications this brings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Both are ways to store funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Cold Wallets

A [[cold_wallets_vs_hot_wallets_what_users_should_know | cold wallet]] is a method of storing funds where private keys are kept offline, disconnected from the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This is often referred to as "cold storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### [[security_features_of_cold_wallets | Advantages of Cold Wallets]]
*   **Enhanced Security:** Private keys are not online, making it difficult for hackers to gain access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Cold wallets are considered far more secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Protection from Online Threats:** Since they are offline, they are immune to online compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_hot_wallets | Disadvantages of Cold Wallets]]
*   **Less Convenient:** Using a cold wallet involves extra steps, adding friction to transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Risk of Loss:** There's a risk of misplacing or losing the physical wallet itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### [[best_practices_for_cold_wallet_storage | Best Practices for Cold Wallets]]
*   **Backup Recovery Phrase:** Always back up your recovery phrase or keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Keep Offline:** Never store recovery phrases or keys online, as this negates the purpose of a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Secure Physical Storage:** Store the backup in a safe place, ideally on a piece of paper that is fireproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Ensure you know exactly where it is stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Hot Wallets

A hot wallet is considered "hot" because it is live and continuously connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

*   **Quick Transactions:** They are commonly used by traders for quickly moving funds on-chain and off-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This lack of friction makes them convenient for frequent transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### [[security_risks_of_hot_wallets | Disadvantages of Hot Wallets]]
*   **Lower Security:** Due to their constant internet connection, hot wallets are much more likely to be compromised compared to cold wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

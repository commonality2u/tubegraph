The [[Monad community and ecosystem | Monad community]] is described as a vibrant and engaged group, built by and for its members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It has grown significantly over the past year, transitioning from smaller, more infrequent interactions to a highly active and diverse ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:20">[02:15:20]</a>.

## Historical Development of the Monad Community

The [[Historical development of the Monad community | Monad community]]'s journey began with an invite-only Discord server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:50">[02:19:50]</a>. The opening of this Discord to the public marked a significant "first foray" for many members, including Intern Bra and two college buddies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:59">[02:21:59]</a>. This expansion coincided with the arrival of other key members like Tunes and Dubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:25">[02:23:25]</a>.

Shortly after the Discord became open, the "locked" Telegram chat emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>. This Telegram group, initially open to everyone from December 2022 to April 2023, eventually became private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. The idea for a chat capped at 1,000 people originated from Kev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The community's growth led to the implementation of "purges" and "missions" to manage membership, resulting in over 2 million messages in the chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:22">[02:49:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. These purges, initially based on simple familiarity, evolved into a data-driven system with the help of ID Kravitz, who provides detailed statistics on member activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

A major advantage for [[History of the Monad Community | community building]] was its start during a "deep bear" market, when there was little other excitement in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

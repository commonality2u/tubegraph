Successfully managing high transaction volumes, especially during events like NFT mints, is a critical challenge for blockchain networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Challenges with High Transaction Volumes

When many users concurrently attempt to engage in high-stress activities, such as an NFT mint, it can lead to system failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Common issues observed on social media during such events include:
*   RPC (Remote Procedure Call) failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Transactions getting reverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

The user experience on Solana in the fall of 2021, for instance, was characterized by widespread issues where people globally were "spam clicking mint buttons," leading to system performance problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. These kinds of high-stress scenarios are difficult to anticipate in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Desired Outcomes for Robust Systems

The goal for [[need_for_performant_blockchain | performant blockchain]] infrastructure like [[nft_news_artifact_and_storage_methods_monad_testnet_sales_records | Monad]] is to gracefully handle situations with 100,000 concurrent users sending 100 transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The aim is to achieve a state where, even under super [[high_throughput_blockchains_and_infrastructure_challenges | high-stress]] conditions with everyone "slamming the system," there is no need to make excuses for why the system failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Continuous monitoring and data analysis are essential to further optimize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Future Stress Testing with AI Agents

There is interest in using AI agents on the [[nft_news_artifact_and_storage_methods_monad_testnet_sales_records | testnet]] to combine AI capabilities with [[high_throughput_blockchains_and_infrastructure_challenges | high throughput]] systems, potentially yielding interesting results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Incentivizing AI to intentionally try and crash the [[nft_news_artifact_and_storage_methods_monad_testnet_sales_records | testnet]] could provide valuable insights into system weaknesses, differentiating from human clicking patterns by employing automated "robot clicking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

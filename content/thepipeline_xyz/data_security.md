Attackers typically target three core areas: funds, access, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding these targets is crucial for robust [[Importance of User Security in Crypto | user security]].

## Primary Targets of Attackers

*   **Funds**
    *   This refers to whatever assets are stored on-chain, on centralized exchanges (CEXes), or in wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Protecting these involves [[Crypto transaction security | secure transaction practices]].
*   **Access**
    *   Gaining [[access_vulnerabilities | access]] allows attackers to use an individual as an interception point to others, such as colleagues, friends, or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. For public figures, compromised accounts can be leveraged in spear-phishing campaigns to gain access to others, for instance, by sending malicious meeting invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Data**
    *   This includes sensitive credentials, which must be rigorously audited wherever they are stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Managing Data Security

To effectively manage data security, individuals must have a strong understanding of all potential points of failure in their digital lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

*   **Identifying Points of Failure**
    *   It is essential to inventory potential vulnerabilities and create an "attack surface map" to identify all points of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Mitigation Strategies**
    *   Once points of concern are identified, it is important to continuously tweak and mitigate issues as they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Cryptocurrency wallets are essential for storing digital assets, and they generally come in two main types: hot wallets and cold wallets. The primary [[differences_between_hot_and_cold_wallets | distinction]] lies in their connectivity to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Cold Wallets
A cold wallet is a method to store funds where the private keys are kept offline, meaning they are not connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This "cold storage" makes them inaccessible to hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Advantages of Cold Wallets
*   **Enhanced Security**: Cold wallets are significantly more secure than hot wallets because their private keys remain offline, making them immune to online [[attack_vectors_in_cryptocurrency | attacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This makes them ideal for storing larger amounts of cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Disadvantages and [[security_of_cold_wallets | Security of Cold Wallets]]
*   **Less Convenient**: Using cold wallets typically requires extra steps for transactions, which can be less convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Physical Loss Risk**: There is a risk of losing or misplacing the physical device that holds the cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Recovery Phrase Importance**: To mitigate the risk of loss, it is crucial to back up your recovery phrase or private keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### [[best_practices_for_wallet_security | Best Practices for Cold Wallet Security]]
*   **Keep Recovery Phrase Offline**: Never store your recovery phrase or keys online, as this would compromise the purpose of a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Secure Physical Storage**: Store the recovery phrase in a safe place, ideally on a piece of paper, and consider a fireproof location that you can easily remember and access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Hot Wallets
A hot wallet is "hot" because it is live and constantly connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Advantages of Hot Wallets
*   **Ease of Use**: Hot wallets are generally very user-friendly and convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Quick Transactions**: They allow for quick on-chain and off-chain transactions, which is why many frequent traders utilize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Disadvantages and [[convenience_and_risks_of_hot_wallets | Risks of Hot Wallets]]
*   **Higher Compromise Risk**: Due to their constant internet connection, hot wallets are much more susceptible to being compromised by hackers compared to cold wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### [[best_practices_for_crypto_security | Best Practices for Hot Wallet Security]]
*   **Limit Stored Funds**: It is advisable never to keep too many funds in a hot wallet because of the increased risk of compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

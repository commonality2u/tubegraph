Attackers primarily target three [[core_targets_of_cyber_attacks | core things]]: funds, access, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Core Targets of Attackers

*   **Funds**
    Attackers aim to compromise funds stored on-chain, on exchanges (Sexes), or in digital wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Access**
    Gaining access allows attackers to use an individual as an "interception point" to compromise people in their network, such as colleagues, friends, or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **Data**
    This includes [[protecting_sensitive_data_and_credentials | sensitive credentials]] wherever they are stored, which require rigorous auditing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Exploiting Access for Social Engineering

If an attacker gains access to an individual's account, especially a public figure's, they could leverage that access in a [[phishing_and_social_engineering | spear phishing campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The objective would be to gain access to others' accounts or send malicious communications, such as a harmful meeting invite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Mitigation Strategy

It is crucial to understand and have a strong handle on all potential points of failure in one's digital life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This involves:
*   Inventorying potential vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Creating an "attack surface map" to identify all points of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Continuously tweaking and mitigating risks as they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

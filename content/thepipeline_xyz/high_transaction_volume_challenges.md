High transaction volume presents significant [[growth_and_scalability_challenges_in_blockchain_ecosystems | challenges]] for blockchain systems, particularly during high-demand events. The goal for such systems is to avoid making excuses when they fail to stand up under stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Scenarios Causing High Volume

One anticipated scenario involves 100,000 concurrent users attempting to send 100 [[understanding_tps_transactions_per_second_in_blockchain | transactions per second]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A prime example of such a stress event is an NFT mint, where a large number of users simultaneously "slam the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Common Failures During High Demand

During periods of high transaction volume, common issues that arise include:
*   RPC (Remote Procedure Call) failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Transactions getting reverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

These types of problems often become public on social media when systems malfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Real-World Examples

A notable example of high transaction volume challenges was the [[user_experiences_with_highdemand_events | user experience on Solana]] in the fall of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This situation was characterized by people globally "absolutely spam clicking mint buttons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, an event difficult to anticipate in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Future Stress Testing with AI

To further test system resilience, there's interest in using AI agents on testnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The combination of AI and [[discussion_on_high_throughput_blockchains | high throughput]] could yield insightful results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. By incentivizing AI to intentionally crash the testnet, developers can simulate extreme load conditions beyond typical human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This approach aims to optimize systems and ensure they handle such volumes gracefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

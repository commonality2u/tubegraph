[[Monad Games stream and contestants | Monad Games]] is a high-stakes, no-holds-barred competition featuring five contestants who battle to earn test net tokens, also known as T-Mo [00:00:07]. The ultimate winner receives $5,000 to give away to the community [00:00:10]. The competition pushes contestants to their limits, with phrases like "I'm so scared" and "Things get dicey" [00:00:20, 00:00:21]. Before the main events, 50 test net tokens are given away to 10 lucky winners who drop their wallet addresses in the first thousand comments [00:02:31].

### Challenge 1: The Dalgona Cookie Carve

Inspired by *Squid Games*, contestants face a cookie carving challenge [00:03:21].

*   **Objective**: Carefully carve out a design from a cookie within seven minutes [00:03:23].
*   **Stakes**: If the cookie breaks, the contestant immediately loses [00:03:29].
*   **Difficulty Choice**: Contestants could choose an "easy" route worth 200 mana or a "hard" route worth 1,000 mana [00:02:45]. Blue represented hard, and pink was easy [00:02:51].
*   **Contestant Choices**: All contestants unanimously chose the "hard" (blue) option, indicating a high-risk, high-reward approach [00:02:58, 00:03:01, 00:03:03].
*   **Tactics**: Contestants attempted various methods, including "licking" the cookie to thin it out [00:04:13, 00:04:42] or melting through the back [00:04:11].
*   **Outcomes**: Several contestants, including Intern, experienced their cookies breaking, leading to elimination [00:05:06, 00:05:33, 00:05:38].

### Challenge 2: John's Mystery Meat

This challenge tests contestants' willingness to try unknown, exotic meats for tokens.

*   **Objective**: Eat a random mystery meat, with each piece worth 100 Monad tokens [00:06:10, 00:06:14]. Contestants must guess what they are eating [00:06:32].
*   **Meats Included**: The selection of meats ranged from common to exotic, including alligator, bison, yak, kangaroo, wild boar, rabbit, rattlesnake, antelope, venison, rocky mountain oysters (bull balls), and traditional chicken sausage [00:06:18]. All meats were deemed safe to eat [00:06:43].
*   **Reactions & Tactics**: Contestants reacted with varying degrees of disgust and surprise. One contestant described a meat as tasting "like poop" [00:09:32], while another noted it was "awful" [00:11:17]. Despite the unusual flavors, contestants earned 100 man for each meat they successfully consumed [00:07:22]. Danny, Pre-balling, and KB successfully completed all meat challenges [00:11:13].

### Challenge 3: Influencer Ranking and Psychic Reading

This round combined self-perception with external evaluation.

*   **Objective**: Contestants first had to arrange themselves in order from most influential to least influential [00:11:40]. Following this, a professional psychic would re-arrange them based purely on her intuition [00:13:33, 00:12:41].
*   **Rewards**:
    *   **500 Mana**: Awarded if the psychic placed a contestant in the exact same spot they had placed themselves [00:12:46].
    *   **1,000 Mana**: Awarded if the psychic placed a contestant in the number one influential spot [00:12:56, 00:12:58].
*   **Psychic Readings**: The psychic provided detailed readings for each contestant, revealing personal traits and perceived influence [00:13:16]. For instance, Danny was described as an "organizer," "empath," "dancer," "performer," and "caregiver" [00:13:18, 00:13:28, 00:13:33]. KB was characterized as a "good leader" who might "burn so fast" [00:15:50, 00:15:52].
*   **Self-Reflection**: Contestants found aspects of the psychic's readings surprisingly accurate, such as one contestant not preferring the spotlight [00:16:27] or another being an "empath" [00:16:32].
*   **Outcome**: Only KB managed to secure the 1,000 mana prize by being placed at the number one spot by the psychic [00:16:03, 00:16:06].

### Challenge 4: Hot or Not Pitch Competition

This challenge combined entrepreneurial pitching with a spicy twist.

*   **Objective**: Contestants had to pick a random prompt for a non-existent startup and pitch it to the group within 60 seconds [00:17:10, 00:17:43, 00:17:46].
*   **Stakes**: There were three levels of "heat" associated with the pitches, offering different token rewards based on the spiciness consumed:
    *   **Jelly Beans**: Worth 200 mana [00:17:18, 00:17:48].
    *   **World's Hottest Chocolate**: Worth 500 mana [00:17:22, 00:17:51].
    *   **The One Chip Challenge**: Worth 2,000 mana [00:17:26, 00:17:53, 00:17:56].
*   **Rules**: Eating the spicy item was optional for pitching [00:17:37]. However, if a contestant drank yogurt (a reliever) before the time was up, they wouldn't get points [00:19:54, 00:19:56]. The other four contestants would judge and score the pitch [00:17:41, 00:17:43].
*   **Pitches & Reactions**:
    *   **Danny**: Chose the world's hottest chocolate and pitched "Only NADS," an AI-powered filter for inappropriate images [00:18:22, 00:18:36, 00:18:40]. He experienced significant discomfort, foaming at the mouth and crying [00:18:45, 00:19:23].
    *   **Intern**: Pitched "Work to Earn," gamifying work tracking and rewarding time spent on the job [00:20:09, 00:20:12]. He also tackled a spicy item [00:20:34].
    *   **Spam**: Pitched "Dog Date Concept," a "Tinder for dogs" for playdates or breeding [00:21:06, 00:21:10].
    *   **Pre-balling**: Pitched "Couch Confessional," an AI priest for spilling secrets, with a crypto V2 roadmap rewarding users based on how "bad" their secrets were [00:22:14, 00:22:26, 00:22:51]. This was praised as the "best pitch" [00:23:21].
    *   **KB**: Took on both the world's hottest chocolate and the one chip challenge for his pitch, "Fridge Cop," an AI audio coach linked to your fridge for dietary feedback [00:23:59, 00:24:19]. He managed to finish his pitch despite the heat [00:25:06, 00:25:10].
*   **Winner**: Intern was declared the winner of the round, receiving 1,500 mana [00:25:48, 00:25:52].

### Challenge 5: Ice Block Seed Phrase

This challenge involved physical effort and quick thinking.

*   **Objective**: Contestants had 10 minutes to break open blocks of ice containing eight words, which formed a numbered seed phrase [00:28:24, 00:28:27, 00:28:34]. The goal was to tell the host the correct order of the seed phrase [00:28:37].
*   **Tools**: Contestants chose from various tools, including a hammer [00:27:08], a spoon [00:27:13, 00:27:59], and a keyboard [00:27:27].
*   **Tactics**: Contestants tried different approaches, from brute force hammering [00:29:42] to strategic breaking to access words [00:30:00]. Some considered looking through the ice to identify words [00:30:06]. A key tactical element emerged when Danny offered to bribe another contestant for a missing word [00:30:19, 00:30:21].
*   **Outcome**: Danny won the challenge, which was an "all or nothing" round worth 1,500 mana [00:30:45, 00:30:51, 00:30:53]. He made a deal to acquire a missing word, which was then given to him for free [00:30:57].

### Final Challenge: Split or Steal

The concluding challenge was a [[trust_and_strategy_in_decisionmaking_games | psychological game]] of trust and strategy.

*   **Objective**: Contestants individually decided whether to "split" or "steal" tokens from a pot worth 2,500 tokens [00:31:30, 00:31:34, 00:31:40]. Their decision was written on a note card and placed in an envelope [00:31:36, 00:31:42].
*   **Rules**:
    *   **Everybody Splits**: Each contestant receives 500 mana [00:31:49].
    *   **Only One Steals**: The single "stealer" takes all the tokens [00:31:51, 00:31:54].
    *   **Two or More Steal**: The "splitters" receive everything [00:31:57, 00:32:00].
    *   **Three or More Steal**: No one wins anything [00:32:03].
*   **Outcome**: After the reveals, it was found that Professor Pipelines (Danny) was the sole stealer [00:34:35, 00:34:39, 00:34:55]. The other contestants — Pre-balling, Intern, KB, and Spam — all chose to split [00:33:52, 00:34:01, 00:34:18, 00:34:46]. According to the rules, Danny, as the only stealer, took all 2,500 tokens [00:34:57].

### Final Winner and Unexpected Act

Professor Pipelines (Danny) was officially declared the overall winner of [[Monad Games stream and contestants | Monad Games]], having accumulated the most tokens [00:35:19, 00:35:25]. He won $5,000 to give away to the community [00:35:28, 00:35:31]. However, in an unexpected move, Danny decided to split the prize among three "awesome OG Monad community members" — Pre-balling, Spam, and KB — rather than keeping it all [00:35:33, 00:35:58, 00:36:10, 00:36:13].

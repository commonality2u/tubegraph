Many people, particularly those who are more humble, may feel reserved or reluctant to "brag" about their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, it's necessary to overcome this feeling and share what you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

A common concern is that sharing an idea will lead to someone stealing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. However, if an idea is good, it's highly likely that someone else is already working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The key is to be the first person to talk about and share it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Establishing Authority

By being proactive in sharing your work, you establish yourself as an authority or the person who understands the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The faster you start talking and sharing, the more beneficial it will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

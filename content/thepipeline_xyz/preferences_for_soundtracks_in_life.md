When asked to choose between always having a personal soundtrack playing for their life or a "sound soundtrack," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> one individual stated a preference for the former, explaining that they already perceive a soundtrack playing in their brain at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The alternative, "sound soundtrack," implies a preference for [[ambient_sounds|ambient sounds]] as opposed to curated music.

## Personal Soundtrack Composition
The internal soundtrack experienced by the individual is characterized by its significant variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, it predominantly features music from artists like Kendrick Lamar, Jam Woods, and selections from musicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

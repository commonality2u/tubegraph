## The Philosophy of "Wholesome Vibes" in Crypto

Pancakes_BR, a notable figure on crypto Twitter, became known as the "goat of good vibes" and "wholesome vibes" partly by accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He initially started his account with a more "aggro" and joking persona, but eventually realized it was easier and more effective to just be himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This genuine and honest approach turned out to be a significant "growth hack" for networking within the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. While many in crypto are seen as "degenerates trying to make it," he considers it a positive not to engage in constant fighting like some others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Pancakes_BR's Journey into Crypto

Pancakes_BR first discovered crypto in 2017 while working in the music industry, managing artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. He followed prominent figures like Kobe and BitLord, observing the timeline from his personal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. His early experience was marked by typical beginner mistakes, such as buying at the top and selling at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

After leaving music, he began traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. In 2021, he jokingly created the "Pancake_BR" account with the intention of being "the worst trader possible" and annoying big influencers with stupid questions, always maintaining a funny and goofy demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This approach garnered attention, and an early retweet from Kobe led to consistent growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Recognizing a potential opportunity, especially with increased demand for marketing and business development (BD) roles in 2021 compared to 2017, he decided to build his account to network his way into a job, despite lacking a traditional resume or university degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. He spent two years networking, becoming friends with "giga brains" in groups like "Grug Hub" (which he describes as one of the highest "Alpha" group chats on Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He focused on giving no "Alpha" or technical abilities, understanding it would be a long game to find a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. He intentionally chose not to do "shills" (paid promotions) early on, despite being "super broke," believing it wouldn't be a good idea for his long-term reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

A lucky break came when he pulled a "Prime Key" from a Parallel pack drop and sold it for $50,000 at the "Pico top," against common advice, to fund his conference circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This allowed him to attend events like NFT NYC and meet crucial connections, including "intern" and many of his closest friends in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Eventually, he tweeted a serious request for a job, which was retweeted by Hintai Avenger, leading to an interview and a job offer from Victor at IDEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This job "saved him" when he was down to $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. IDEX also provided significant support when he was hospitalized for six months, keeping him on payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Currently, he continues his work in crypto while also exploring [[alternative_career_paths_outside_of_crypto | advising artists]] and musicians, and looking into Web2 SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. He describes his current lifestyle as "monk mode" in Argentina, working 12+ hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Staying Engaged in Crypto: The Power of Community

Pancakes_BR almost walked away from crypto multiple times, but the friendships he formed, particularly with Grug, kept him in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. He realized he didn't need to be a "creative" or "funny" person in a planned way, but rather to operate in a "flow state" by being himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This involved "reply guying" hard, being funny, nice, or "obnoxiously stupid on purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Even when people initially found him corny or cringe, he eventually won them over by showing there was "no way to piss him off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

He acknowledges that he is not good at [[advice and reflections on trading in the crypto market | coin trading]], having lost significant money on PancakeSwap, which is where his name originated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. His "one skill" is "buying a token and then it going straight down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This led him to realize that trying to make crypto his job solely through trading wasn't for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. He focused on finding how he could help companies in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

A key part of his strategy was meeting anonymous accounts in person at conferences, which built significant trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. He believes that if people trust you in this space, "the opportunities are unlimited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

### The Value of the Crypto Community

Pancakes_BR expresses a deep love for the crypto community (CT), having made "really, really close good friends" in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Unlike the music industry, which can be competitive, his approach in crypto never felt like competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

He emphasizes that the crypto community offers significant opportunities, especially for those who are outliers with non-traditional backgrounds, like himself, who lacks a degree or a formal resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. In crypto, companies often care more about what you can deliver, your ability to pivot, learn quickly, and whether you are a trustworthy person, rather than credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

He is a strong proponent of avoiding arguments on the timeline, preferring to reply in a "silly way" and never getting "tilted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Twitter Spaces, particularly during the bear market, have been crucial for building relationships with both "deep CT native people" and the Web3/NFT crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

He consciously chose not to do paid shills, even when financially struggling, believing it would harm his reputation long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. He acknowledges that some people do paid shills out of necessity, but it wasn't his path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This decision has led to unlimited opportunities because people in the space trust him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

### Community vs. Tribalism

Pancakes_BR distinguishes between "CT" (Crypto Twitter) as a "real community" where people care about each other, and the NFT community, where "community" often feels like a marketing term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. He notes that while there are "bad actors" and "PVP" (Player vs. Player) dynamics in CT, he has met more genuine, nice people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

He stresses the importance of empathy, not getting jealous of others' success, and taking personal responsibility for losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. He believes the crypto space is currently too small for tribalism and infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. He advocates for a "we're all on the same team" mindset, acknowledging that "rising tide lifts all ships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. Successes in crypto, even from competitors, contribute to a better name for the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

## Strategies for [[getting_started_in_crypto_for_beginners | Getting Started in Crypto for Beginners]] and Career Growth

Pancakes_BR offers several key tips for those looking to [[getting_started_in_crypto_for_beginners | enter crypto]] and find a job:

*   **Consistency and Engagement**: Show up every day and stay engaged, especially during bear markets, without complaining or losing drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. OGs in the space notice small accounts that stick around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.
*   **Authenticity and Kindness**: "Be yourself," but avoid being an "asshole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. Be genuine, kind, empathetic, and light-hearted, not taking things too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.
*   **Emotional Control**: This is the biggest advantage for anyone in crypto, whether a trader or networker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. It's crucial to avoid getting "tilted" by negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   **Twitter Strategy**:
    *   Make most of your timeline consist of your own original tweets; avoid retweeting too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.
    *   "Reply guy" aggressively to important people in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. This strategy, though sometimes mocked, led him to a career in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
    *   Engage with every person who comments on your posts and reply to every DM for as long as it's scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This builds high engagement and establishes you as a community member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Willingness to Learn**: If you lack skills, teach yourself to be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. You don't need to learn to code; roles like community manager for a Discord server or running a Twitter account can provide opportunities to learn from the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.
*   **Give Value for Free**: Be willing to offer value without immediate expectation of return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. This long-term thinking can lead to significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>.
*   **Networking and Trust**: Don't burn bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. Building a network and being genuine leads to trust, which is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. Knowing people in person (even anonymous accounts) builds more trust than just hiring a random person from the timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Impact of Community on Project Success

Pancakes_BR believes that a strong, authentic community is a key indicator of a good crypto project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.

*   **Personality over Brand**: People prefer to follow an authentic personality rather than just a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. Protocols that try to sound too corporate and don't engage in the fun, meme culture of crypto are less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   **Understanding the Culture**: Companies that understand crypto culture, even by being edgy or humorous (without being hateful), gain respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. Crypto is "put off by tourists or corporate" approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
*   **Human Element**: It's crucial for protocols to have a human being, skilled at Twitter, representing their brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. This personal connection makes engagement easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Reading the Room**: Protocols need to understand the sentiment of the timeline and show empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. This comes naturally when the team is part of the community and genuinely feels the same emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **Founder Engagement**: Founders who have been part of the community for a long time and are respected have a higher chance of success and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. It's difficult for companies to succeed without spending time in the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

## Future Trends and Challenges in Crypto

Pancakes_BR shares his outlook on future developments in crypto:

*   **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes)**: He is excited about improvements and use cases in DEXes, seeing them as "extremely important" on the technical/DeFi side of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Social Applications**: For mass adoption, he believes crypto needs something like "social media platforms or apps or protocols" that are genuinely fun, attracting users not because they are crypto-based, but because they are enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>. He is bullish on this happening in the next bull run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.
*   **Gaming**: While many are bullish on gaming, Pancakes_BR is "a little bit more bearish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. Most crypto games have focused on "play-to-earn" rather than being fun, which is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. He argues it's very hard to make a fun game, even for large, experienced studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. He thinks it will take traditional gaming companies adopting crypto technology rather than crypto-native teams building the next hit game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.
*   **Music Industry Disruption**: Coming from the music industry, he is "extremely bullish" on crypto "completely disrupting the music industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. However, he is "very, very open about being bearish on like music NFTs as like the thing that does it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. He sees more potential in protocols that can ensure artists are paid "quickly, efficiently," as about 70% of money in music never reaches the artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.
*   **NFT Bull Run's Impact**: He has mixed feelings about the NFT bull run. While it brought many new people in, it also led to a lot of "grifting," putting off influential mainstream individuals from the entire crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. He anticipates an "NFT grift Bull Run 2.0" in the next cycle, potentially even bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.
*   **Long-Term View**: He emphasizes that no one is truly an "expert" in crypto, as it's still the "wild west" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. The focus should be on continuous improvement rather than immediate "super cycles" or "winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. The goal is for crypto to eventually find its place in the world in a way that truly benefits people en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>.

Ultimately, he advises, [[future_prospects_for_community_members_in_crypto | the future of crypto]] lies in figuring out "what everyone else cares about in the world" and whether the technology can improve their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.

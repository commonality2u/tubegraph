[[social_engineering_and_phishing_attack | Social engineering]] poses a significant threat within online trading communities, often leading to [[compromised_trading_accounts | compromised trading accounts]] and substantial financial losses. Attackers employ elaborate tactics to deceive users, leveraging platforms like Twitter and Telegram to execute their schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Case Study: The Y22 Incident

A notable case involved a trader known as y22, who gained popularity by publicly sharing his successful [[crypto_trading_strategies_and_experiences | trading journal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His high engagement on [[crypto_twitter_and_community_engagement | Twitter]] made him and his followers targets for a sophisticated social engineering attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### The Attack Mechanism
An attacker posted a link to a fake Telegram group within y22's Twitter thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Upon entering this Telegram group, users were prompted to "verify" their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This verification process involved "extra added steps" that ultimately directed users to perform an action on their desktop browser, specifically moving them from phone to desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This critical action on the desktop browser, where hot wallets were accessible, led to the compromise of accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Deception Tactics Used
The perpetrator employed several deceptive tactics to make the fake account and group appear legitimate:
*   **Identity Mimicry**: The attacker meticulously mimicked y22's entire Twitter history, including follower count, and created a username similar to his actual Twitter handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Verification Badge**: The fake account also displayed a gold checkmark, further enhancing its perceived legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Outcome
As a direct result of this [[phishing_scams_in_the_crypto_industry | phishing scam]], y22's accounts were compromised, and he reportedly lost everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Extent of Social Engineering Efforts
Attackers are willing to go to extreme lengths to compromise individuals, including significant financial investment. It is cautioned not to assume that a malicious actor would not spend five figures on a social engineering campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Experts in [[spear_phishing_and_social_engineering | social engineering campaigns]] confirm that considerable time, effort, and money can be expended to compromise a large number of at-risk individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

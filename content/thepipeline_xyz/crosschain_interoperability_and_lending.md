Cross-chain interoperability, specifically within decentralized finance (DeFi), has become a significant focus in the crypto industry. The goal is to tie together multiple ecosystems to unify liquidity and enhance user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

## Introducing Pike Finance

Pike Finance is a project at the forefront of this movement, described as a universal liquidity protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### What is Pike Finance?
In its simplest form, Pike Finance is a [[Blockchain interoperability | cross-chain]] lending market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. It allows users to deposit assets on one chain and borrow against them on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. The project aims to unify liquidity across various DeFi [[Blockchain Ecosystems and MultiChain Vision | ecosystems]], including EVM chains like Ethereum, Optimism, and soon Monad, as well as non-EVM ecosystems such as Solana, IBC/Cosmos, and Move-based chains like Aptos and Sui <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

### How Pike Finance Achieves Cross-Chain Functionality
Pike Finance deliberately avoids using traditional bridges to enable its [[crypto_interoperability_and_crosschain_communication | cross-chain]] functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Instead, it utilizes [[Axelars Approach to CrossChain Connectivity | cross-chain messaging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>, specifically leveraging Wormhole messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

The process involves sending a message from one chain to another rather than transferring assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. For example, if a user deposits assets on Optimism and wants to borrow on Base, Pike sends a message from Optimism to Base confirming the deposit, allowing the user to borrow on Base without moving the actual assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

### Vision for Universal Liquidity
Pike Finance exclusively deals with native assets, completely avoiding bridged assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This approach is rooted in the vision to eliminate confusing prefixes and suffixes often associated with derivative or receipt tokens (e.g., LP tokens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. The goal is to simplify the user experience for a future with millions of on-chain participants, ensuring clarity and ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

## Pike Finance's Mainnet Launch and Traction

Pike Finance went live on its mainnet on February 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.

### Launch Details
The mainnet launch was a capped launch, meaning supply was capped, to allow the team to stress-test the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. Building on arbitrary message bridges (AMBs) is still a new and complex endeavor, requiring assurance of performance and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.

### Early User Adoption and Metrics
Despite a relatively low supply cap per wallet, Pike has seen close to 4,000 unique wallet counts within the first five days of its mainnet launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. Users are genuinely interested in trying out native [[crypto_interoperability_and_crosschain_communication | cross-chain]] applications, as evidenced by feedback on their Discord channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>.

Pike operates using a hub-and-spoke model, with several spoke chains allowing users to access Pike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. These include Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. Arbitrum has shown the most [[interoperability_in_blockchain_networks | cross-chain]] messages registered, followed by Optimism and then Base, reflecting the existing DeFi activity on those networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:10]</a>. This demonstrates Pike's thesis of being a universal liquidity protocol, with liquidity flowing between Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

## Strategic Alignment: Pike Finance and Monad

Pike Finance committed early to supporting Monad, which is significant given Monad's early stage of blockchain maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

### Monad's Appeal: Performance and EVM Compatibility
Pike Finance's excitement for Monad stems primarily from its performance capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. The team recognizes that users prioritize performance and low costs, as demonstrated by the success of Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. Solana, despite its monolithic nature and high barrier to entry (requiring new wallets and asset transfers), offers a Web2-like experience due to its speed and low transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. Solana ranks second in terms of volume and highest in stablecoin transfers, indicating a strong user preference for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

Monad, however, uniquely combines Solana's performance and low fees with the EVM ecosystem's advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. It maintains consistency with the experience of other EVM chains, meaning users can seamlessly use Monad with existing tools like MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. For developers, Monad's environment is nearly identical to developing on Ethereum, minimizing friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>. This blend of EVM compatibility and high performance makes Monad a "match made in heaven" for Pike, enabling them to build a universal liquidity protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

## The Future of Pike Finance

### Roadmap and Key Initiatives
The immediate next milestone for Pike Finance is to lift the supply cap, which they are working towards diligently with security partners, aiming for sometime in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:50:00">[43:50:00]</a>.

Looking further ahead, Pike plans to explore new use cases for [[blockchain_interoperability | cross-chain]] lending, leveraging Monad's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:31:00">[44:31:00]</a>. This includes supporting new types of assets like LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) and LRTs (Liquid Restaking Tokens), which are anticipated to expand beyond Ethereum to other ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:48:00">[44:48:00]</a>. Monad's high-performing EVM is seen as a potential hub to connect liquidity with other chains for these new asset types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:17:00">[45:17:00]</a>. This is currently in the research and ideation phase and is considered a midterm horizon, depending on Monad's development schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:33:00">[45:33:00]</a>.

### Cross-Chain Governance
On a longer-term basis, Pike Finance is interested in [[interoperability_in_blockchain_networks | cross-chain governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:02:00">[46:02:00]</a>. As arbitrary message bridges become more robust and more applications build on them, the challenge of rolling out governance across many different chains becomes significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:09:00">[46:09:00]</a>. Pike aims to leverage [[blockchain_interoperability | cross-chain governance]] to minimize overhead while still ensuring participation across all chains where Pike is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:59:00">[46:59:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to foster a "melting pot" concept that extends beyond [[cryptocurrency_bridging_and_liquidity | liquidity]] to include community and governance participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:22:00">[47:22:00]</a>.

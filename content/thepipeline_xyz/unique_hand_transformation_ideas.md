When prompted to imagine replacing one's hands with anything, one creative idea proposed is a modified version of human hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Proposed Hand Transformation

The specific idea for hand replacement involves:
*   **Three-finger versions of hands** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   These new hands would feature **thumbs on each side** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   The overall concept is described as "hands but better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, suggesting enhanced functionality or design.

*   "What's the [[weirdest_habits|weirdest food combination]] you secretly love?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   "Would you rather always have a soundtrack playing for your life or sound soundtrack?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   "If you could merge two animals into one, what would you create?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> (leading to a discussion of [[animal_hybrid_creations|animal hybrid creations]])
*   "What's a conspiracy theory you would start just for fun?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   "Would you rather sneeze glitter or cry confetti?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

[[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_hot_wallets | Hot wallets]], which are connected to the internet, carry inherent security risks that can lead to significant financial loss if compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Case Study: Trader Y22 Compromise

A notable trader, known as y22, lost nearly all his crypto assets due to a sophisticated social engineering attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Y22 gained significant traction by sharing his profitable trading journal online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Attack Methodology

The compromise began when an imposter posted a link to a fake Telegram group in y22's Twitter thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
1.  **Impersonation**: The attacker meticulously mimicked y22's Twitter history, follower count, username, and even displayed a gold checkmark to appear legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
2.  **Redirection**: Upon entering the fake Telegram group, users were prompted to verify their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
3.  **Malicious Action**: This verification process required additional steps that led users from their phone to perform an action on their desktop browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
4.  **Compromise**: Performing this action on the desktop browser, where the victim's [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_hot_wallets | hot wallet]] was located, resulted in the wallet being compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Attacker Sophistication

Attackers are willing to invest significant resources, potentially five figures, to compromise individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Successful social engineering campaigns require substantial time, effort, and money to target a large number of at-risk individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The Monad ecosystem has experienced a significant week, marked by major announcements, continued [[Monads Devnet announcement and significance | Testnet]] advancements, and vibrant community activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Key Announcements & Strategic Partnerships

### Circle and Native USDC on Monad Mainnet
Circle will be deploying on Monad Mainnet, bringing native USDC, Circle Wallets, and CCTP v2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This is considered a "huge unlock" for [[Projects in monad | DeFi]] within the [[Monad ecosystem developments | Monad ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Having native USDC addresses a fragmentation problem where multiple versions of USDC can exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
<div class="callout">
    **Native USDC vs. Bridged USDC**
    When USDC is natively issued on a blockchain, Circle directly deploys a smart contract allowing users to deposit dollars and mint USDC on-chain. This means the creation and redemption mechanism occurs directly on that blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. If USDC is not native, it's issued on another blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) and sent over a bridge, making it a "claim token" that requires bridging back to the original chain for redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Native USDC eliminates this fragmentation and confusion, as seen in other ecosystems like Avalanche or Arbitrum where bridged versions initially existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
</div>
Circle is also bringing CCTP v2, a mechanism to transport USDC from one chain to another, allowing users to "teleport" USDC from chains like Ethereum or Solana to Monad, where it will be reissued natively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This ensures the official Circle-issued version of USDC is available from day one on Monad Mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Sequence and Other Infrastructure
Sequence has fully deployed on the Monad Testnet, providing significant benefits by unlocking flexibility for developers to focus on building applications and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Other infrastructure already set up for builders includes Magic Eden for NFTs, Phantom wallet, Uniswap, Wormhole, and LayerZero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

## Community Activities & [[Monad ecosystem developments | Projects in Monad]]

Recent community initiatives include:
*   **Monad Games**: Featured prediction markets powered by Opinion Labs and an on-chain cipher game created by the Monad Foundation engineering team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Shark Tank number two**: Held in the Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Community Shout-outs
Limo, a long-time community member, was recognized for his "amazing woodworkings" of the Monad and Pipeline logos, which he sent to the New York office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

[[monads_team_and_community_development | Keone]], co-founder of Monad and GM at the Monad Foundation, made his first appearance on "Monad in the Morning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

[[monads_team_and_community_development | KZ]], Quant at the Monad Foundation, also made his first appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

Community members such as Nuke Lion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>, Admiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>, Mel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>, Soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, RSKL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>, Kiwi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a>, M.

## State of Monad NFTs

Karma, Monad Foundation's NFT lead, presented an [[Projects in monad | overview of the NFT market]], both generally and specifically within Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.

### General NFT Market Conditions
The NFT market is currently at or near "rock bottom" in terms of weekly volume and active addresses over the past two years, indicating a "winter" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:34">[01:35:34]</a>. Blur and OpenSea continue to dominate volume on EVM chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>. Despite the downturn, this period is seen as an opportunity for new projects and founders to capture new audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:07">[01:41:07]</a>.

Two notable projects seeing recent insane volumes:
*   **Open from Jack Butcher**: An ongoing collection with community-sourced editions, including the "animals zoo pep pen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:13]</a>.
*   **Courtyard**: Tokenizes and connects physical collectible cards (e.g., baseball, Pokemon cards) with minted NFTs on-chain, acting as a "real-world assets play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:39">[01:38:39]</a>.

### Monad-Specific NFT Developments
Karma highlighted several [[Projects in monad | Monad-native NFT projects]]:
*   **Monape**: An OG project whose PFPs were drawn live in Discord streams. It recently released a high-quality trailer for a new chapter in its lore, featuring different PFP fractions contributing to a joint story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:49">[01:41:49]</a>.
*   **Blocknuts**: An art-focused collection with low supply and individual traits. The team experimented with their own minter on Testnet, allowing raffle tickets for a fairer distribution and avoiding botting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:34">[01:43:34]</a>.
*   **Free Mints**: Artists Driy and Amnet partnered with Live Art for a new artist incubation program on Monad, releasing open-edition free mints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>.

#### Hidden Gems
*   **Mona Moors**: A "super cute" collection with an "unhinged but wholesome energy," rapidly gaining followers through community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>.
*   **Kruxful**: A project creating a community of collectors to attract different artists for small-supply exclusive mints. Its founder, Games, has deep understanding of the art market and a network to bring interesting artists, including Dada (known for work with Starbucks Korea), to Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:12">[01:48:12]</a>.

## The Monad Technical Vision and [[Development journey of Monad | Progress]]

Keone addressed the common question: "Why do we need another L1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

<div class="callout">
    "No blockchain right now is in a state to be able to support the scale of global adoption... Ethereum processes about a million transactions per day. So by definition that is not enough to support the entire world's usage." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>
</div>
Monad is fundamentally a technology project introducing new technologies to address this scalability problem, aiming to take Ethereum and the EVM from a million transactions per day to a billion-plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. This involves:
*   A new consensus mechanism (based on BFT) for keeping hundreds to thousands of globally distributed nodes in sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>.
*   Optimizing the networking layer and block propagation mechanism (Raptorcast) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.
*   Efficient communication for new nodes to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

The Testnet is a crucial "proof that this technology works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>, demonstrating:
*   Over 10,000 transactions per second in load tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   Nearly 1 billion transactions to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.
*   150 million accounts created in two months, compared to Ethereum's 250 million over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

[[monads_team_and_community_development | KZ]] further emphasized Monad's commitment to building base technologies from scratch, enabling a raw performance boost of 10,000 transactions per second without compromising decentralization or security (the blockchain trilemma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. He noted that unlike Solana's marketed TPS, Monad's 10,000 TPS is "real" and achieved across a diverse set of transactions, not just simple token transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:03">[01:22:03]</a>.

## Outlook and [[Future initiatives and events for Monad | Future Initiatives]]

The [[Overview of Monad and its community | Monad team]] maintains a long-term vision, focusing on building performant infrastructure to enable crypto to "eat the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. Keone stressed that optimism comes from deep knowledge of what's possible and trust in the team and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>.

The Testnet period is seen as a "perfect amount of time" for developers to experiment, get user feedback, and build new applications, amplified by the capabilities of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. The Monad community is recognized for its "incredibly high" talent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.

Developers are encouraged to leverage the Testnet and contribute to the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. Upcoming NFT events include Gospel of Bob on April 20th and Coronad's mint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:36">[01:51:36]</a>.

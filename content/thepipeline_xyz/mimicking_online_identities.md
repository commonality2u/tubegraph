Mimicking online identities is a sophisticated tactic used by attackers to compromise individuals, often involving significant effort and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This method typically falls under the umbrella of [[Social engineering and phishing attack | social engineering campaigns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Case Study: The Y22 Incident

A notable [[crypto Twitter personalities | trader]] named Y22 gained significant [[Engagement and influence on social media platforms | traction]] by publicly sharing his trading journal on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. An attacker exploited Y22's popularity by posting a link to a fraudulent Telegram group within his Twitter thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Deception Tactics

The attacker meticulously mimicked Y22's online persona to enhance credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   They replicated the entire Twitter history of Y22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   They also mimicked the follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   The username chosen was made to be similar to Y22's actual Twitter handle, a common tactic for [[how_hackers_exploit_similar_looking_addresses | exploiting similar-looking addresses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   The impostor even managed to acquire a gold checkmark, further adding to the illusion of authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### The Compromise Method

Upon entering the deceptive Telegram group, users were prompted to verify themselves, which involved additional steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This process required users to switch from their phone to their desktop browser to perform a specific action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This action, performed on the desktop browser where hot wallets are typically accessed, led to Y22's compromise and the loss of nearly all his assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Attacker Motivation and Effort

This level of investment indicates the potential returns attackers anticipate from such activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

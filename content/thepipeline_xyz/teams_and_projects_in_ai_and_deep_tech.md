These ventures highlight the [[future_growth_and_potential_of_new_technologies | future growth and potential of new technologies]] when combined with blockchain.

## Advancing AI Scalability and Inference

### 42
42 is a protocol dedicated to addressing the scalability of AI, a challenge that traditionally limits the number of API requests to centralized providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The team, with over a decade of experience in [[ai_and_blockchain_potential_intersections | AI projects]], including self-learning AI agents and conversational AI platforms, is building a "planetary layer for AI scalability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

Their approach leverages:
*   **Small Language Models (SLMs)**: Noting rapid progress, such as Qwen 2.5 which can run on a MacBook Air and surpass GPT-4 in certain tasks like coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.
*   **Excess Compute**: Utilizing the largely untapped processing power of modern consumer devices, where users typically use only about 20% of their computer's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
*   **Swarm Inference**: A self-supervised inference mechanism where nodes collaborate, peer-reviewing responses and compiling a knowledge tree to generate accurate answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. This method significantly lowers inference costs (by 100x) and improves AI accuracy by mitigating issues like hallucination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

42's research paper on these findings was presented at MIT's Decentralized AI Summit, and they are preparing to launch their devnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

## Decentralized Data and Specialized AI Applications

### Ever Network
Ever Network is building a decentralized healthcare data storage protocol on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. They aim to solve the problem of siloed and centralized medical records by giving users ownership and control over their health data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. This includes features like an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to inquire about symptoms without needing a doctor's visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. The platform also enables users to monetize their data by licensing it to pharmaceutical companies, insurance providers, and drug researchers, or by being recruited for clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Ever Network has established government contracts, notably with the Thai government, managing medical records for over 650 hospitals and 10 million patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

### JoJo World
JoJo World is a decentralized AI 3D data platform focused on collecting high-quality 3D data for training large world models and AI 3D models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. They incentivize creators, particularly UI/UX professionals and architects, to contribute 3D data using tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. This data, used by companies like Google and Nvidia, is crucial for developing spatial intelligence for robotics and virtual simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. JoJo World has accumulated over 1 million raw spatial 3D datasets and is working with partners such as Nvidia and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

### Primus
Primus specializes in cryptography technology, offering a compute and verification network that combines Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:20">[02:21:20]</a>. Their aim is to build a cryptographic layer for secure data intelligence, connecting authenticated, high-value data from Web2 to Web3 and AI applications in a trustless manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:03">[02:23:03]</a>. Primus claims their protocol is 10 times faster for TLS verification and 300 times faster for verifiable computation compared to other solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. They offer data verification capabilities for digital goods marketplaces, verifiable data markets, and prediction markets, with a long-term goal of deploying FHE for confidential AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:47">[02:24:47]</a>.

### Score
Score Technologies is bringing "Moneyball" to the world of sports, starting with football (soccer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:07">[02:58:07]</a>. Their decentralized network of football intelligence uses over 200 AI models that compete to provide insights from game data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:21">[02:59:21]</a>. These models analyze vast amounts of data—up to a million data points per match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:34">[03:00:34]</a>—to help coaches with tactical shifts, discover new talent, prevent injuries, and even create automated media content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>. Score plans to open-source their models and ingest 200,000 games per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:48">[03:00:48]</a>. They have partnerships with football figures like Harry Kane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:46">[03:01:46]</a>.

### Totem
Totem is the first AI deepin network designed to unlock the value of daily conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>. They provide a device that attaches to a phone, capturing voice data and converting it into real-time transcription, translation, and summarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:11">[04:11:11]</a>. This data is then encrypted using ZK proofs to become anonymized datasets, which users can upload on-chain via Monad's fast throughput in exchange for tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:26">[04:12:26]</a>. The hardware is designed by an Apple expert, and the AI models are optimized by experts from Google and Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:47">[04:41:47]</a>. Totem aims to monetize through device sales, premium subscriptions, and selling anonymized data to AI companies for model training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:59">[04:42:59]</a>.

## Blockchain's Economic Layer for AI

### G
G is building the economic layer for AI and compute, enabling the creation of new types of on-chain assets backed by "real AI cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:02">[03:39:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:42">[03:42:42]</a>. They aim to provide direct exposure to the GPU asset class, which they argue can generate high yields (100-200% APL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:07">[03:40:07]</a>. G tokenizes GPUs and their yield, offering DeFi use cases like GPU-backed stablecoins, lending, borrowing, and structured products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:48">[03:45:48]</a>. Their architecture is designed for transparency and decentralization, with an orchestration layer for continuous monitoring of underlying GPU assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:08">[03:47:08]</a>. The yield is generated from demand for AI compute, with one co-founder's existing AI cloud company (GMI Cloud) already generating significant revenue from AI cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a>.

The Monad platform is poised to host a diverse array of applications and offers significant opportunities for community members looking to engage within the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Ecosystem Growth and Opportunities
The [[investment_and_growth_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad ecosystem]] is being developed with the aim of creating a highly engaged environment where relationships between community members and projects can flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. A key aspect of this growth is the intention to have many community members hired natively within the [[opportunities_and_careers_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Career Paths within the Ecosystem
There is a strong expectation that the [[opportunities_and_careers_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad community]] will become a significant source of talent for projects building on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Many projects currently developing on Monad are actively seeking community and marketing personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

It is recommended that ecosystem projects hire "crypto native" and, specifically, "Monad native" individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Teams that have successfully integrated members from the [[growth_and_development_of_the_monad_community | Monad community]] and embraced its culture have shown the greatest success so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Being a part of the [[growth_and_development_of_the_monad_community | Monad community]] is seen as one of the most straightforward ways to gain recognition and secure full-time positions in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

> "If you want to work full-time in crypto joining the Monad Community is the easiest way to get recognized and then placed, it's like becoming like an incubator for top talent in the space which is truly wild." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>

Staying active and engaged in the [[growth_and_development_of_the_monad_community | Monad community]] daily is considered an effective strategy for maximizing one's opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Vertical Applications on Monad
Similar to the diverse "verticals" (Discord, Telegram, Twitter) within the [[growth_and_development_of_the_monad_community | Monad community]], the platform anticipates a wide range of on-chain applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
A significant area of excitement is the development of Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs) on Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.
*   **CLOBs Explained**: CLOBs are order books that operate entirely on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Currently, most on-chain crypto trading uses Automated Market Makers (AMMs) due to high gas fees which make it unprofitable for market makers to provide liquidity on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
*   **Monad's Advantage**: Monad's low fees and high Transactions Per Second (TPS) capabilities (e.g., 10,000 TPS) will make it economically viable for market makers to provide on-chain liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. This is expected to lead to much deeper liquidity and superior execution for traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. The user experience provided by such high-performance execution environments is believed to be so compelling that users will be unlikely to revert to older systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

### Gaming
The gaming sector on Monad is highly anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. It is expected to combine a frictionless user experience with strong community interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This means users could trade NFTs with friends and participate in collective leveling up within games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. Specific community initiatives like on-chain poker are also highly anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

### Other On-chain Verticals
Beyond DeFi and gaming, other anticipated on-chain applications include:
*   NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>
*   Social applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>
*   The "financialization of fun," where off-chain activities like co-creation and identity building transition on-chain, incorporating social interaction, games, and NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

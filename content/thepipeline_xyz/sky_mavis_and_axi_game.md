Sky Mavis is a company believed to be the parent company of Ronin, a blockchain company that developed the popular game called Axi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Ronin Network Hack

The Ronin Network, associated with the Axi game, experienced a significant security breach that might still be the largest hack in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The incident resulted in approximately half a billion dollars in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Initial Compromise

The hack originated from a phishing incident where a Sky Mavis DevOps Engineer was "fished" with a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is believed the engineer clicked an executable file sent in relation to the job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Multi-sig Vulnerability

A critical point of failure was that the compromised device of this single individual granted access to four keys of a multi-signature wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A multi-sig wallet acts like a door requiring multiple keys to unlock it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In this case, five keys out of nine keyholes were required to unlock it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Through social engineering, the attackers obtained four keys from the compromised engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They then performed lateral movement, moving from the initially compromised device to another, to acquire the fifth key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. With all five keys in hand, they were able to compromise the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Financial Impact

The breach, stemming from what began as a compromised office email, led to immense financial damage, estimated at about half a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

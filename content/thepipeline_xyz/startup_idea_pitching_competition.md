Within the high-stakes [[monad_madness_pitch_competition | Monad Games]], a segment known as "Hot or Not" challenged contestants to demonstrate their [[evaluation and potential of startup teams | pitching abilities]] by presenting hypothetical startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. The challenge aimed to see if participants could articulate a "billion-dollar idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

## Game Mechanics and Challenges

The "Hot or Not" game involved contestants picking a random prompt for a non-existent business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. To increase the stakes, each pitch was accompanied by a "heat" challenge, requiring the pitcher to consume a spicy item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>:
*   **Jelly Beans:** The "easy route," worth 200 mana tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **World's Hottest Chocolate:** A riskier option, worth 500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **The One Chip Challenge:** The most difficult, valued at a whopping 2,000 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

Contestants had 60 seconds to pitch their idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, while the other four contestants judged and scored them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Consuming a yogurt smoothie to counteract the spice before the time limit resulted in no points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This element added a layer of [[Pitching experiences and challenges | physical challenge]] to the [[pitch competition dynamics | pitching process]].

## Startup Pitches

### Danny's "Only NADS"
Danny chose the world's hottest chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. His pitch was for "Only NADS," an AI-powered filter designed to block inappropriate images and "protect your eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Despite the intensity of the chocolate, Danny continued his pitch, though he later admitted he couldn't remember what he had pitched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

### Pre-balling's "Work to Earn"
Pre-balling opted for the jelly beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. His idea, "Work to Earn," proposed a revolutionary concept that gamifies work tracking and rewards individuals for time spent at their job, allowing them to "get paid on top of your normal work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

### KB's "Dog Date Concept"
KB also chose the jelly beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Her pitch was for "Dog Date Concept," described as "Tinder for dogs," allowing users to "swipe to match pups for playdates or breeding" to find a "perfect match" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

### Spam's "Couch Confessional"
Spam selected the red jelly bean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. His pitch, "Couch Confessional," was an AI priest service where users could "spill your deepest darkest secrets to big data which promises not to use them against you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. He then elaborated on a V2, which would integrate into the [[startup generation in crypto | crypto space]] with its own L2, scaling to an L1, where users would be rewarded with tokens based on "how bad your secrets were" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. His pitch was well-received by the judges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

### Intern's "Fridge Cop"
The Intern demonstrated significant resolve by choosing both the world's hottest chocolate and the one chip challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. His idea, "Fridge Cop," proposed an "AI audio coach linked to your fridge," providing "realtime dietary feedback" to prevent unhealthy eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

## Round Winner

Despite the intense spicy food challenge, the Intern was declared the winner of the pitching round, earning 1,500 mana tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. Spam secured second place, followed by Pre-balling, and then KB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. Danny, who took the hottest chocolate, felt emotionally defeated despite his initial confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

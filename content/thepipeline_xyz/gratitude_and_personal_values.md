*   The opportunity to work on something they are extremely passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Personal Values and Working Style

A significant self-discovery for the speaker is the inability to work alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As a triplet, they have always had people around them since birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This preference for collaboration extends to all aspects of their life, as they enjoy doing things with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. They acknowledge that they do not possess the [[skill_development_and_personal_goals | skill]] to do everything by themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

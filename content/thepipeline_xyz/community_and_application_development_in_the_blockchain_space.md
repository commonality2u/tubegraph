The public testnet for Monad is officially going live, showcasing years of technological development and marking a new phase for its ecosystem and [[importance_of_community_in_crypto_projects | community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This launch is not seen as a finish line, but rather a starting line for continuous innovation and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.

## Monad's "Build from Scratch" Approach

Monad adopted a unique approach, [[building_communities_in_crypto | building]] its protocol entirely from scratch to gain greater technical control over the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. While forking an open-source project allows leveraging existing work, Monad's developers felt they would have modified so many aspects that it wouldn't make sense for ongoing maintenance or new feature development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This approach enables precise control over implementation details, such as memory allocation and disk interaction, to achieve optimal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

The decision to build from scratch for high performance was driven by Ethereum's inherent rate limiting, which focuses on low node requirements rather than raw execution performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Monad was envisioned as a high-performance EVM chain from the outset, with the primary restriction being 100% EVM Ethereum compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This ambitious undertaking required specialized low-level systems engineers, who are difficult to find, typically working in big tech, silicon manufacturing, or high-frequency trading firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Technical Innovations

The main challenge for Monad was achieving concurrent execution to leverage multiple CPU cores, as most existing blockchain clients are single-core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Transactions within a block have dependencies, making pipelining difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Monad's key innovations revolve around how to execute transactions and keep the machine constantly busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. A major focus was optimizing database access, as waiting for disk access (which takes 30 microseconds or more) can quickly add up across many transactions, leaving the CPU idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This led to the development of Monad's custom database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

This concept is often referred to by the [[building_communities_in_crypto | community]] as the "washing machine analogy": just as you can wash, dry, and fold different loads of laundry concurrently to maximize efficiency, Monad pipelines transactions to keep the CPU busy and achieve higher throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Monad's Impact on Applications and [[user_and_developer_acquisition_in_the_blockchain_ecosystem | User and Developer Acquisition]]

Monad aims to provide a highly performant shared global state, enabling anyone to [[user_and_developer_acquisition_in_the_blockchain_ecosystem | build applications]] that can reach millions or hundreds of millions of users who already have on-chain assets, digital identities, and historical application usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

Monad is specifically enabling two key verticals:
*   **High-Fidelity DeFi:** Enabling personal finance to scale to hundreds of millions of users with extremely cheap transaction fees and low slippage due to efficient liquidity provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   **Consumer Space:** Supporting applications that need to scale to hundreds of millions of users with over a billion transactions per day, requiring the scale that Monad provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

The ability for [[user_and_developer_acquisition_in_the_blockchain_ecosystem | application developers]] to sponsor gas fees, made feasible by Monad's low transaction costs, significantly lowers the barrier to entry for users and unlocks new business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. This is particularly relevant for decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), where large potential usage often comes with high price sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.

## Devnet vs. Public Testnet and Benchmarking

The Devnet served as an early feedback loop for testers and infrastructure providers, helping Monad identify and fix issues, and add unanticipated features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. One team on Devnet generated 3 trillion gas in a few hours, equivalent to about 30 days of Ethereum throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

Monad emphasizes using replayed Ethereum history for benchmarking on its Devnet and Testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. This approach simulates real-world usage patterns, unlike simple token transfers or ERC20 operations, which are less taxing on the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. Real Ethereum usage includes complex AMMs, lending protocols, and computationally expensive ZK proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. Monad aims to handle such real-world, high-gas usage scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

> "The difference between [[building_communities_in_crypto | building]] a system that works and a system that's really optimized... it's like going from one to 100 whereas [[building_communities_in_crypto | building]] the plane is going from zero to one." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
> "Monad is really about [[building_communities_in_crypto | building]] the performance engineering layer... so that we can get much more performance and much cheaper transactions for everyone." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>

## Goals of the Public Testnet

The public testnet serves several key goals:
*   **Technical Exercise:** To exercise the technology, gather more feedback on the client, and identify areas needing further optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.
*   **Technology Showcase:** To showcase the power of the underlying technology and the applications [[user_and_developer_acquisition_in_the_blockchain_ecosystem | built]] on top of Monad that leverage its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **[[building_and_engaging_community_in_crypto_spaces | Community Engagement]]:** To generate excitement within the crypto space, allowing the [[importance_of_community_in_crypto_projects | community]] to interact with and explore what Monad's performance enables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **[[user_and_developer_acquisition_in_the_blockchain_ecosystem | Builder]] Feedback:** To enable teams to deploy their applications publicly, gather user feedback, and identify how their products perform under real-world conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

## The [[role_of_community_and_collaboration_in_crypto_projects | Role of Community]] and Future Growth

One of the key misunderstandings about Monad, and many blockchain projects, is that a mainnet or testnet launch is the "finish line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>. For Monad, it's merely the starting line for years of continued innovation, optimization, and the addition of new features like improved usability, privacy, and further decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>.

The [[building_community_within_blockchain_ecosystems | Monad community]] has been incredibly supportive and engaged, primarily through off-chain activities like Discord, Telegram, Twitter, memes, and IRL meetups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>. The testnet now provides the first on-chain opportunity for [[building_and_engaging_community_in_crypto_spaces | community members]] to directly interact with Monad, appealing to users who are "terminally on chain" and whose engagement centers around trading and using new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.

The testnet is expected to attract more [[user_and_developer_acquisition_in_the_blockchain_ecosystem | builders]] who were waiting for Monad's public launch, fostering significant ecosystem growth as teams receive feedback and refine their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

Monad represents a bet on [[user_and_developer_acquisition_in_the_blockchain_ecosystem | application builders]] leveraging high-performance infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The adoption of crypto applications and wallets is seen as consistently increasing, providing a foundation for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. While some applications (like more efficient DeFi or consumer apps) are predictable outcomes of increased speed and lower costs, the most exciting [[opportunities_and_careers_within_blockchain_communities | opportunities]] are the unpredictable new applications that will emerge, similar to how video streaming (YouTube) and photo sharing (Instagram) became massive after significant bandwidth improvements in the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>.

This testnet launch signifies a significant step in pushing the decentralization-performance tradeoff curve forward substantially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. It's a call to action for the [[the_role_of_community_in_the_crypto_industry | community]] to explore, build, and contribute to this new "city" of opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:58:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

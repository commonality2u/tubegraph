When [[reasons_businesses_create_content | creating content to promote a business]], an [[targeting_market_audience_with_content | audience-first approach]] prioritizes providing value to the viewer rather than solely focusing on self-promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This strategy aims to create a different dynamic with the audience by offering them something beneficial or entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Contrasting Approaches

A traditional approach to business promotion often centers on highlighting internal qualities, such as using organically sourced ingredients or high-quality materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method can be perceived as "me me me" marketing, where the focus is entirely on the business itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

In contrast, an audience-first approach strategically positions content so that the audience's needs and interests are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Example: The Sandwich Shop

Consider a sandwich shop looking to promote its business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead of creating a commercial emphasizing their organic vegetables and high-quality meats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, they could adopt an audience-first strategy.

One [[creative_content_ideas_for_business_promotion | creative content idea]] would be to produce a series about the best picnic spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. In this series, while showcasing various picnic locations, the sandwich can be subtly included as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This approach allows the business to provide valuable information or entertainment to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The business can still mention desired details about their product, but the overall message is centered around the value provided to the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

This strategy transforms the promotion into an [[engaging_audiences_through_storytelling | engaging]] experience for the audience, shifting the dynamic from self-promotion to service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Key Principle

The fundamental principle of an audience-first approach in business marketing is to consistently consider the [[valuedriven_marketing_strategies | value]] that can be provided to other people through content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

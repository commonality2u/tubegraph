Creating an [[attacker targets | attack surface map]] is a crucial step in enhancing personal security, especially in the digital realm. It involves systematically identifying potential points of failure and concern within an individual's or entity's digital footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Understanding Attacker Targets

Typically, [[attacker targets | attackers]] aim to compromise three core things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

*   **Funds**
    *   This includes any assets stored on-chain, centralized exchanges (CEXes), or in wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Access**
    *   Gaining [[access vulnerabilities | access]] allows an [[attacker targets | attacker]] to use an individual as an interception point to people around them, such as colleagues, friends, or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. For example, if a public figure's account is compromised, it could be leveraged in a spear phishing campaign or to send malicious meeting invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Data**
    *   Sensitive credentials and other data must be rigorously audited wherever they are stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Purpose of an Attack Surface Map

The primary purpose of an [[attacker targets | attack surface map]] is to gain a strong understanding of where all the "points of failure" exist in one's digital life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The Process

To create an [[attacker targets | attack surface map]], one should:

1.  **Inventory Things**: Begin by cataloging all digital assets, accounts, and sensitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
2.  **Identify Points of Concern**: Map out all potential vulnerabilities and areas that could be exploited by an [[attacker targets | attacker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
3.  **Tweak and Mitigate**: Continuously adjust and implement measures to reduce risks as they are identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

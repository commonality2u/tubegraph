Creating an attack surface map is a crucial step in cybersecurity, involving the identification and inventory of all potential points of failure that could be exploited by attackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This process helps to understand the scope of vulnerabilities and allows for proactive mitigation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Core Targets of Attackers

Typically, attackers target three [[core_targets_of_cyber_attacks | core things]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

*   **[[common_attack_vectors_in_crypto | Funds]]**
    Attackers often aim for funds stored on-chain, centralized exchanges (CEXes), or in wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Safeguarding these assets is a primary concern in mapping out potential attack vectors.
*   **[[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | Access]]**
    Gaining [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | access]] allows attackers to use an individual as an interception point to reach others, such as colleagues, friends, or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. For example, if a public figure's account is compromised, attackers could leverage that [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | access]] in a [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | spear fishing campaign]] to gain [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | access]] to someone else's account, or send malicious meeting invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Data**
    Sensitive credentials and other data, wherever they are stored, must be rigorously audited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Unauthorized [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | access]] to data can lead to severe consequences.

## Process of Creation

To create an effective attack surface map, one must thoroughly understand all potential points of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This involves:

1.  **Inventorying Assets:** Begin by inventorying all assets, accounts, and systems that could be targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  **Identifying Points of Concern:** Map out these assets and identify all potential points of concern where a vulnerability might exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
3.  **Mitigation:** Once the attack surface map is complete, the next step is to tweak and mitigate identified risks as they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This ongoing process helps maintain a strong security posture.

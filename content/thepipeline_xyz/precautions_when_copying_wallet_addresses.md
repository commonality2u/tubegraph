When handling cryptocurrency transactions, it is crucial to exercise caution, especially when copying wallet addresses. A common threat to be aware of is the "address poisoning attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Understanding Address Poisoning Attacks

Address poisoning attacks involve malicious actors monitoring your transaction ledger, such as an Etherscan record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Upon detecting an incoming transaction, they can immediately send a transaction to your wallet (or from a wallet mimicking yours) using an address that closely resembles one of your legitimate contacts or even your own secondary wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The fraudulent address is designed to have identical or very similar first and last characters to a legitimate address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This exploit leverages the common display characteristic in many interfaces where only the beginning and end of a long address are visible, with the middle characters often hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### The Risk

If you are not paying close attention, you might inadvertently copy this spoofed address from your transaction history when attempting to send funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This can lead to sending a large amount of money to the wrong, malicious address, resulting in significant financial loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Precautions

To mitigate the risk of address poisoning and ensure the security of your transactions:

*   **Be Aware**: Understand that address poisoning attacks are a real threat that has caused substantial financial losses for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Use Direct Sources**: Always copy and paste wallet addresses from their original, direct source, such as your own wallet interface, rather than from transaction histories where spoofed addresses might appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **[[verifying_crypto_transaction_addresses | Verify the Entire Address]]**: Before finalizing any transaction, make sure you [[verifying_crypto_transaction_addresses | verify that it's the exact address]] you intend to send to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Do not rely solely on matching the first and last few characters; inspect the full address meticulously.

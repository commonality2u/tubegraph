Bryan Pellegrino is the co-founder and CEO of LayerZero, a leading interoperability protocol in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. His background spans professional poker, machine learning, and multiple entrepreneurial ventures before co-founding LayerZero.

## Early Life and Education
Pellegrino grew up in a small town of 900 people in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He spent his early years focused on computers, primarily playing video games before discovering programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. He initially pursued a Computer Science degree but later dropped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Professional Poker Career
Following his departure from university, Pellegrino embarked on a career as a professional poker player, a path he pursued for eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. During this time, he traveled to 80 countries, competing in the highest stakes poker games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. His first encounter with Bitcoin occurred when online poker was banned, leading shady poker sites to adopt Bitcoin for money movement, which introduced many in the poker community to crypto early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This period of his career highlights his [[alternative_career_choices_outside_of_crypto | alternative career choices outside of crypto]] and initial exposure to digital currencies.

## Entrepreneurial Ventures and Research
After his poker career, Pellegrino launched and sold a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. He developed machine learning models that were acquired by professional baseball teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. He then co-founded another company in Silicon Valley with an early engineer from a16z and former Google employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This company, a competitor to CoinList, achieved approximately a billion dollars in overall value before being acquired two years later after two pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Pellegrino also engaged in significant research, publishing work that was cited by DeepMind, a notable achievement for a college dropout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Founding LayerZero
LayerZero was co-founded by Pellegrino alongside two long-time collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. All three founders attended university together and worked in an IEEE testing and conformance lab focusing on early interoperability and networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. They had also built several companies together previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The idea for LayerZero initially emerged from a personal tinkering project. The team observed the rise of alternative chains like BNB Chain (BSC) and explored building applications that could leverage cheaper, faster environments while retaining state permanence on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. They developed a game where gladiators fought on BSC, and if they won ten battles, an NFT was minted permanently to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This project highlighted the lack of a reliable way to coordinate contracts across chains without a central coordinator, leading them to investigate existing bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

Pellegrino and his team were "horrified" by the state of bridges at the time, particularly the reliance on wrapped assets, which shifted risk from liquidity providers to end-users by forcing them to hold an IOU with perpetual risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. This led them to focus on native asset bridging with instant guaranteed finality, which was a precursor to Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. The realization that a fundamental transport layer was still missing to trigger events across chains ultimately led to the creation of LayerZero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

LayerZero's core philosophy emphasizes being purely focused on the transport layer and agnostic to validation methodologies, believing that different applications have diverse needs for validation and pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

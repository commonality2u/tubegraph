From: [[thepipeline_xyz]] <br/> 

The future of blockchain technology is envisioned as a seamlessly interconnected ecosystem, enabling diverse applications and fostering broader adoption through efficient crosschain communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This vision aims to facilitate the decentralized world's expansion into areas traditionally dominated by centralized services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## The Need for Interoperability

Seamless [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability and blockchain communication]] are critical for the growth of decentralized technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Different blockchains excel at different functions, possess distinct programming languages, and adhere to various standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. A unified [[interoperability_and_blockchain_communication | interoperability layer]] is essential to bridge these gaps and enable these diverse environments to communicate seamlessly and trustlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### LayerZero's Role

LayerZero, as described by its co-founder and CEO Brian Peligrino, functions as a base "packet" or transport layer for sending data across distributed execution environments (blockchains) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This is akin to the internet's fundamental role in connecting different computer systems, allowing arbitrary contract invocations and byte array movements between chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The goal is to connect all chains so they can "talk to each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

LayerZero emphasizes a focus on the transport layer, remaining agnostic to various validation methodologies, whether they involve external validators, staking, or zero-knowledge proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. This approach allows other "competitive" solutions to integrate as verifiers within LayerZero's framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Driving Real-World Solutions

Crosschain communication is crucial for solving pressing real-world problems by enabling:

*   **Disruption of Finance and Money** The initial thesis for crypto revolved around self-sovereignty and permissionless access to financial interactions, challenging traditional banking systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Efficient Payments** Crypto offers a way to avoid intermediaries and their fees, such as the substantial 3% charged by credit card companies on transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. In the developed world, this means eliminating large costs for businesses, while in the undeveloped world, crypto (like Tether) is already widely used for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Personal Finance (DeFi)** The future of personal finance could see DeFi become the standard for banking, trading, borrowing, and lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This requires systems that offer equal or better user experiences than centralized tools, meaning reduced slippage and lower execution costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Removal of Friction and Inefficiencies** Current financial systems often include high fees for currency exchange or asset transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. A [[scaling_blockchain_ecosystems | shared global state]] with high execution for transactions and swaps can remove this unnecessary friction, enabling efficiency and fairer pricing mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## The [[future_of_blockchain_cooperation_and_multichain_ecosystems | Multi-Chain Future]]

LayerZero's co-founder, Brian Peligrino, strongly believes in a [[future_of_blockchain_cooperation_and_multichain_ecosystems | multi-chain future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This outlook suggests that various blockchains with "strong orthogonal tradeoffs" (e.g., Monad, Solana) will coexist and serve different purposes, rather than one chain dominating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. Applications may leverage different environments for storage, computation, and other functions, with the underlying communication layers becoming invisible to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.

### Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs)

A significant development for crosschain communication is the concept of Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. OFTs address the limitations of "wrapped assets" which force users to hold an IOU, bearing perpetual risk that their asset could become worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

OFTs facilitate [[interchain_token_services | native asset transfer]] with instant, guaranteed finality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This means an asset issuer can manage their assets directly within their contract across multiple chains, eliminating the need for external bridging providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. The cost of moving large amounts of assets (e.g., $100 million in Tether) can be reduced to mere gas fees, approaching zero friction for inventory management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. This vastly improves capital efficiency, enabling market makers to arbitrage spreads across chains at sub-cent levels, leading to more efficient markets and reduced slippage (e.g., from 5% to single-digit basis points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## Impact on New Blockchains and Applications

For new blockchains like Monad, robust, trustless crosschain mechanisms are crucial from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. They enable users to move assets and data from established chains to new environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Monad, with its fully bytecode EVM compatibility and underlying parallel execution database, enables high throughput (10,000 transactions per second) that can support new kinds of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

This opens up new dimensions, allowing users to play games, trade on on-chain order books, or interact with social apps on a high-performance chain like Monad, while potentially leveraging data or authority that originates from another blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. This means users don't have to "restart from scratch" when exploring new environments, facilitating split functionality between execution and data without user burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

## Renormalizing User Expectations

A significant shift in the [[future_potential_of_blockchain_applications_and_adoption | future potential of blockchain applications and adoption]] will be the "renormalization" of user expectations regarding costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. Current users are accustomed to high gas fees ($20 for a transaction) and high slippage (1% or more for trades), which can deter new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. As [[future_of_high_performance_and_scalable_blockchains | high-performance and scalable blockchains]] like Solana and Monad emerge, offering transaction costs as low as $0.00001, users will experience a world where actions are "basically free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.

This change will:
*   **Reduce User Friction** Users will no longer need to worry about an "action budget" per day or avoid transactions due to high withdrawal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Improve Developer Practices** Developers will be less compelled to compromise on defensive assertions or security optimizations to reduce gas costs, leading to more robust and secure protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

This cost normalization will enable a new wave of applications and users, fostering broader adoption of decentralized technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.

## The End Goal

Ultimately, the goal for fundamental crosschain communication layers is to become invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>. Just as developers building on the internet don't consider TCP/IP, future blockchain developers should simply be able to build applications without needing to understand the underlying crosschain mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. The focus is on building foundational utility that empowers applications, even if their specific uses are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. The true measure of success will be the performance and utility delivered over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.

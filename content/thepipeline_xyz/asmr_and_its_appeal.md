ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, was briefly mentioned in a rapid-fire question segment. A participant requested "nice ASMR water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This request was reiterated, asking for "nice ASMR water in here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The transcript does not elaborate on the specific appeal of ASMR or the sensations it provides.

When engaging with cryptocurrency, users should be aware of various fraudulent transaction tactics, such as address poisoning attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. These tactics fall under the broader category of [[social_engineering_tactics | social engineering tactics]] and [[social_engineering_and_phishing_attacks | social engineering and phishing attacks]], aiming to trick users into making errors.

## Address Poisoning Attacks

An address poisoning attack involves an attacker sending a small amount of cryptocurrency to a victim's wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The attacker monitors the victim's transaction ledger, such as on EtherScan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The attacker then sends a transaction with an address that looks very similar to an address the victim frequently interacts with, possibly even their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

This similarity is achieved by creating an attacker's address where the first and last characters closely match the intended legitimate address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Often, in browser displays, the middle characters of a long address are truncated or hidden, making the fake address appear identical at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The goal is to exploit inattention: when a user reviews their transaction history, they might accidentally copy the attacker's address, mistaking it for the legitimate one they meant to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This can lead to sending a large amount of money to the attacker's address instead of their intended recipient, which has resulted in significant financial losses for victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Prevention

To ensure [[crypto_transaction_security | crypto transaction security]] and engage in [[preventing_loss_in_crypto_transactions | preventing loss in crypto transactions]], it is crucial to:
*   Be aware of such tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Always use the direct source when copying and pasting addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   If an address is from your own wallet, verify that it is the exact address you intend to send to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The [[monad_testnet_launch | Monad public test net]] has officially gone live, a moment that the community has anticipated for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This launch allows users to begin interacting with the network and its applications immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Accessing the Testnet

Users can access the [[monad_testnet_launch | Monad testnet]] through its primary landing page at `testnet.monad.xyz` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. For those who are already part of the Monad Community and use the Phantom wallet, a dedicated experience is available at `monad.testnet.phantom.me` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## [[connecting_wallets_to_monad_test_net | Connecting Wallets]]

The first step upon reaching the landing page is to [[connecting_wallets_to_monad_test_net | connect a wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While some wallets offer native testnet support, others may require manual network addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This process is simplified with a "one-step" button that automatically adds the testnet to wallets like MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## [[claiming_test_net_tokens_via_faucet | Claiming Testnet Tokens]]

To engage with the testnet, users will need testnet tokens, which can be acquired via the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This is done by pasting a public wallet address and clicking "get testnet MON" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The amount of tokens claimable can vary based on certain parameters, and the faucet refreshes throughout the day, allowing daily claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## [[making_transactions_on_monad_test_net | Making Transactions]]

Once testnet tokens are obtained, users can perform their first trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The testnet features three meme coins—the House of Mandac, the House of Makaki, and the House of Chog—available for direct purchase on the landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. These trades are powered by Blinks by Dialect and Uniswap, marking a significant "day one deployment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Exploring Applications

The [[monad_testnet_launch | Monad testnet]] showcases a variety of applications available from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. These include:
*   **Fantasy Top** (with a tournament starting soon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>

*   An **Ecosystem Directory** that will be regularly updated with new apps and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This directory is the primary resource for discovering new activities on the testnet, and users are encouraged to check it frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Purpose and Engagement

The primary purpose of the [[monad_testnet_launch | testnet]] is to allow new application experiences to be deployed and tested in a lower-stakes, lower-risk environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

There is significant opportunity for active participation within the [[Monad Labs and Blockchain Innovations | Monad ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

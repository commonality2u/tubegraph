[[the_role_of_community_in_the_crypto_industry | The role of community]] is a significant advantage when [[building_and_engaging_community_in_crypto_spaces | building and engaging community in crypto spaces]], especially for projects that also involve hardware alongside software [00:05:05]. Unlike traditional startups that may need to pay users to test their products, crypto projects can leverage their native communities to bootstrap a user base and gather feedback [00:38:11].

## The Power of Crypto in Community Formation

Crypto is exceptionally powerful for formulating culture within specific groups [00:21:23]. This can manifest in various forms, such as:
*   Belief in meme coins [00:21:31]
*   Adherence to principles like privacy and self-sovereignty [00:21:41]
*   Focus on asset ownership and its implications for daily life [00:21:47]

The ability to foster these communities through the ownership of tokens and, in Pulse's case, the ownership of data, provides a substantial advantage that traditional Web2 platforms like Whoop or Oura Ring lack [00:21:53]. This allows projects to leverage their community for growth and scaling to achieve critical mass [00:22:16].

## Pulse's Approach to Community

Pulse, a lifestyle wearable that rewards users for their data, plans to build a hardcore fan base, aiming for 10,000 users primarily from the crypto community over the next six months [00:15:16]. This initial phase will focus on refining the app, positioning, branding, and proving the stickiness and value of Pulse for productivity [00:15:30].

After establishing this core community, Pulse intends to expand into the broader "Normy Market" [00:15:58]. This will involve marketing on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, using language tailored to resonate with diverse user segments such as busy moms, students, and high-performers [00:16:04]. The goal is to scale from 10,000 to 100,000 and then to a million users, which will require different messaging and platforms, including influencer marketing and paid advertising [00:16:42].

### Building on Monad

Pulse chose to build on Monad because of its infrastructure, which supports challenging the limits of on-chain data writing, and its strong community alignment [00:40:49]. The Monad community is described as already "pilled" on the value of consumer crypto, meaning Pulse does not need to convince them of its value proposition from day one [00:41:55]. This natural interest in health, wellness, and optimizing productivity within the Monad community, evidenced by groups like "Iron Nads" and "Monad Run Club," makes it an ideal ecosystem for Pulse [00:42:10]. The enthusiasm for health-related initiatives within the Monad ecosystem is notably high [00:42:24].

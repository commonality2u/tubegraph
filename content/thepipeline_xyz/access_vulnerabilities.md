Attackers often target three core things: funds, access, and [[data security | data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## What is "Access" in this Context?

"Access" refers to the ability to use an individual as an interception point to people around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This includes colleagues, friends, family, or other individuals associated with the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Why is "Access" a Target?

If an attacker gains access to an individual's account, they can leverage that access in campaigns, such as spear phishing, to gain access to someone else's accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Examples include sending malicious meeting invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Mitigation

A strong handle on potential points of failure is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This involves inventorying potential vulnerabilities and starting to [[creating an attack surface map | create an attack surface map]] to identify points of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Once identified, these issues can be tweaked and mitigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The Monad public testnet is now live, offering numerous opportunities for community engagement and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article outlines how to get involved and explore the [[monad_community_opportunities | Monad ecosystem]].

## Getting Started on the Testnet

To begin, visit the Monad testnet landing page at either `testnet.manad.xyz` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> or `monad.testnet.phantom.me` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> for a Phantom wallet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

1.  **Connect Your Wallet**: The first step is to connect your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While some wallets offer native testnet support, others may require manual network addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This process is straightforward; you can auto-add the testnet to wallets like MetaMask with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  **Obtain Testnet Tokens**: Acquire testnet tokens via the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Simply paste your public address into the faucet and click "Get Testnet Monad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The amount claimable may vary based on parameters, and the faucet refreshes throughout the day, so checking daily is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
3.  **Make Your First Trade**: Once you have tokens, you can make your first trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The landing page features three meme coins – Mandac, Makaki, and Chog – which can be purchased directly via Blinks by Dialect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These coins are powered by Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Exploring Decentralized Applications (dApps)

The testnet offers a "multitude of experiences" and dApps available from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>:

*   **Featured Apps**:
    *   Fantasy Top, with a tournament starting soon after the testnet launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   Other featured apps listed on the main landing page include Rare Bet Sports, 42 KY, Kuru, Curv, and ANS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Directory**: Below the featured apps, an ecosystem directory lists additional projects and will be updated throughout the testnet phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This serves as the primary resource for discovering new activities and [[future_initiatives_and_events_for_monad | opportunities]] on the [[developments_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad public testnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Users are encouraged to revisit this page frequently to find new apps and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Providing Feedback

A core purpose of the testnet is to deploy and test new app experiences in a lower-stakes environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Users are strongly encouraged to "try out lots of dApps and give teams your feedback" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

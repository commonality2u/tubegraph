Creating a good game is considered a significant bottleneck in the gaming industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The process of creating a game is viewed as more challenging than creating an on-chain game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Approach to Integration

A preferred approach for integrating blockchain components into gaming is to first develop a fun game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, and then add on-chain elements to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is not recommended to start by focusing on asset tracking and other blockchain features before the game itself is well-developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

An example of this successful integration model is Roblox, where the platform was established first before the concept of [[integrating_nfts_in_games | NFTs]] was considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This emphasizes that the primary bottleneck for [[challenges_in_the_cryptocurrency_gaming_sector | gaming]] remains the creation of an enjoyable user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Addressing Existing Challenges

Even without blockchain, gamers currently engage in active trading of digital assets, such as CS:GO skins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Furthermore, a grey market for RuneScape gold has existed for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

However, these traditional methods often involve users being scammed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, or engaging in insecure practices like wire transferring funds to anonymous individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. These existing methods are described as significantly less secure than crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This highlights [[opportunities_and_challenges_in_gamefi_and_blockchainbased_gaming | opportunities]] for blockchain to provide more secure and transparent trading environments for in-game assets.

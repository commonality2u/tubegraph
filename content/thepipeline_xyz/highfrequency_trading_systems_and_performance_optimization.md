The development of high-performance systems for high-frequency trading (HFT) served as a foundational inspiration for addressing performance challenges in blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:57">[02:10:57]</a>.

## High-Frequency Trading at Jump Trading

Beginning in 2014, engineers worked on a high-frequency trading team at Jump Trading, focusing on building comprehensive trading systems from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The core function of these systems involved:
*   Ingesting large volumes of data packets from exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Executing rapid trading decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Sending orders back to the exchange swiftly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

HFT is a highly competitive field where speed is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The system that can decide and send an order faster than a competitor gains the advantage, whether by taking liquidity with an aggressive order or securing a position in the queue for a passive order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This environment is characterized by extreme latency competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Performance Optimization in HFT

The competitive nature of high-frequency trading necessitated continuous iterations of system improvements, focusing on:
*   Shaving off latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Building highly performant systems from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Transition to Blockchain Performance

By 2021, the team transitioned to the crypto sector within Jump, engaging with [[crypto_trading_strategies_and_experiences | DeFi projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This work, particularly with Solana DeFi, highlighted a significant demand for more performant blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

A critical observation was the inefficiency of existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementations, which had not undergone the extensive [[optimization_strategies_for_blockchain_clients | optimization]] seen in HFT systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The team's background in [[challenges_in_building_highperformance_systems | building high-performance systems]] for HFT was recognized as ideal for tackling these [[blockchain_scalability_and_highperformance_systems | challenges in blockchain performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

This led to the realization that substantial [[blockchain_performance_optimization | optimization]] was required in the EVM space, providing the initial inspiration for projects like Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The experience in optimizing traditional trading systems directly informed the approach to enhancing blockchain performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

[[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith]] operates as a decentralized oracle, where its governance framework enables direct on-chain management of updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This structure is designed to foster a sustainable business model that allows the protocol to function without requiring a permissioned instance or direct sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>.

## Pith Token and Governance

The [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith token]] plays a crucial role in empowering its decentralized governance model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

*   **Airdrop and Distribution**: A retrospective airdrop for the [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith token]] took place in November, representing the largest cross-chain activity to date, involving 27 blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:04">[03:07:04]</a>. The token was made accessible to users of applications on these blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Approximately 100,000 wallets were in scope, with about half having claimed their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith token]] itself is an SPL token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   **Staking and Participation**: The initiative aimed to socialize this piece of [[advantages_of_decentralized_and_trustless_protocols | decentralized infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, allowing users to actively participate in governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Currently, over 110,000 wallets are staking in the [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith protocol]], which is more than double the initial number of claimants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This significant engagement highlights the belief in the idea of [[advantages_of_decentralized_and_trustless_protocols | decentralized infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Community Engagement

The strong community engagement in [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith]] governance is a key factor in its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. Mike Cahill notes that the size of the staking community, at 110,000 wallets, is substantial compared to other [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | DeFi]] projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>:

*   Aave: ~15,000 wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>
*   GMX: ~20,000 wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>
*   Synthetix: ~40,000 wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>

While Solana (250,000) and Celestia (400,000) have larger communities, [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith]]'s rapid growth since its November launch indicates strong excitement and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

Keone, CEO of Monad Labs, emphasizes that both [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith]] and Monad share core values, including a high regard for [[advantages_of_decentralized_and_trustless_protocols | decentralization]] and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. He states that community is "everything in crypto" and is also "the most fun thing to work on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

## Governance Milestones

The community will gain direct control over the [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith network]] with an upcoming vote for the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, which will be the first vote that officially arms governance with the ability to manage the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Economic Model and Data Publishers

The [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith]] architecture is designed with a sustainable commercial model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The [[Pith Net and its role in decentralized finance | Pith Net]] blockchain aggregates data from approximately 100 publishers, handling 400 symbols updating several times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This data is equally accessible to 50 connected blockchains and over 300 applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

A small fee is collected each time [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith]] data is delivered to another blockchain for an application's use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This fee can then be distributed to the data publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. This incentivizes data owners to publish their information, providing a new economic model where compensation is gained for valuable data, rather than relying solely on advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This model ensures robustness and longevity for the data source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

This system is unique because trading firms, like Jane Street, Susquehanna, Virtu, and DRW, have never monetized their data before, which they use to train models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Pith]] offers them an opportunity to commercialize these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. The involvement of large institutions, including exchanges like Cboe, in publishing data to the blockchain daily signifies a major milestone for institutional adoption in the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

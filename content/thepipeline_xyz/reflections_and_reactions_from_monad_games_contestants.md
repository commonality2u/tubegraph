A bonus stream was held to provide a behind-the-scenes look at [[competitions_and_surprise_challenges_in_monad_games | Monad Games]], featuring its contestants for a live recap and discussion of their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The show, which premiered less than a week before the stream, was an action-packed content experiment designed to be fun and engaging for the [[Community Dynamics in the Monad Ecosystem | Monad community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Contestants [[winners_of_monad_madness | KB]], Pre-Ballin, Spam, Intern, and Danny (the host) discussed their unfiltered thoughts on the production and outcomes of the games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Initial Impressions and Expectations

The contestants filmed Monad Games two months prior in Denver, but did not see the final edited episode until its global premiere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Their reactions varied:

*   **KB** was pleasantly surprised, finding the final product "a lot less cringe than I was afraid it was going to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. She noted that the editing effectively portrayed the fun they had, especially since they knew each other well, unlike typical game show contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Pre-Ballin** was nervous about the outcome, especially since he was "a little hung over" during filming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. However, he found it "turned out great" and wasn't self-critical watching himself on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Spam** initially expected a simple cut of scenes from the full day of filming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. He was particularly impressed by the "mememory behind it and like the actual like meme video style edits," highlighting the disorientation zoom-in after Danny ate the chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **Intern** was surprised by the episode's length (almost 40 minutes) given the relatively short filming time (four to six hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. He praised the smooth clipping and editing, calling the experience a "massive W" and "so much better" than typical conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. He's eager to "run it back anytime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

Danny, the host, admitted to being "pretty stressed behind the scenes" during filming, ensuring each challenge was completed within the rented studio time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. He felt the final product "exceeded my expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## The Element of Surprise: Unforeseen Challenges

A key aspect of Monad Games was that contestants were intentionally kept unaware of the challenges beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Jessup, the brainchild behind the games, wanted to capture "really authentic reactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### The Psychic Challenge

This particular challenge elicited strong reactions due to its unexpected nature:

*   **Danny** was the first to face the psychic, expecting a known crypto figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. He described being "quite rattled" and opting for a "play it safe" strategy by nodding and smiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **KB** found it "a little freaked out" and entered with a "big shield on," staring back at the psychic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. She noted that most contestants felt "defeated" after the psychic challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. KB speculated that the psychic might have struggled due to reading online personas vs. IRL identities, given their government names were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **Pre-Ballin** was famously told he was "the type of guy to steal a lighter," which was featured in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The psychic also inaccurately told him he was "a good cook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   **Spam** was deemed "so nice and empathetic to every person every mother would want you as a kid," which was humorously contrasted with a tweet about "farting on people on the public transportation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   Jessup clarified that the psychic challenge was originally planned as the third game to allow contestants to warm up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>, and he also expected it to be conversational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

## Favorite and Least Favorite Challenges

*   **Danny** disliked both the psychic and the chocolate challenge, finding the latter "brutally painful" and causing his brain to be "literally on fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. He struggled to pitch or hear others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **Pre-Ballin's** favorite was the spice challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. He noted the dark red jelly beans (ghost pepper) were the worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. Danny observed Pre-Ballin chewed his jelly bean for the entire pitch, intensifying the spice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
*   **Spam** strategically swallowed both the jelly bean and chocolate in the spicy challenge to maximize points without prolonged exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. He confirmed the chocolate was both sweet and spicy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **Sophie** enjoyed the ice challenge because she liked "seeing people like throw things on the floor and I like watching things break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. She expressed disappointment that KB didn't win the "egg games" (likely referring to the overall game) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   **KB's** least favorite was the pitch/spicy challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>. Her initial strategy to eat the chocolate changed after seeing Danny's reaction, leading her to choose the jelly bean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. She admitted to fumbling the pitch due to nerves and an inability to multitask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>. She started strong by being named "most influential" by the psychic and scoring first points, but then "didn't win any other one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Intern** found his jelly bean "very manageable" and joked he should have eaten 20 to gain more points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. A debate arose over the ice challenge, with Intern arguing for a level playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. Danny, who won this challenge, explained his keyboard tool was ineffective, forcing him to use his hands, which proved to be the "best strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Spam also revealed he had a duplicate of Danny's word during the ice challenge, effectively "swindling" and "saving" him by trading it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.

## The One Chip Challenge (Bonus Content)

Sophie, a Monad Foundation team member, demonstrated remarkable bravery by taking on the One Chip Challenge, which no contestant attempted during the main Monad Games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. She ate a raw onion beforehand and consumed the chip without milk or the provided glove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. Despite the intense pain and feeling the chip move through her digestive system for 24 hours, she declared, "I would do anything for the [[Community Dynamics in the Monad Ecosystem | monad community]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

## The Cipher Challenge

A surprise [[onchain_elements_and_technology_used_in_monad_games | onchain activation]] of Monad Games was a hidden cipher in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Jessup conceived the idea, and the Monad Foundation engineering team built an app using ZK (Zero-Knowledge) technology for guesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.

*   Contestants were unaware of the cipher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.
*   **KB** and **Pre-Ballin** were "super confused" and couldn't figure it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>.
*   Over 30,000 onchain guesses were submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, but only 43 unique guesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>. It was intentionally "really really hard" to prevent it from being cracked in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   The cipher's design prevented off-chain simulation and bot attacks, making it a truly challenging on-chain puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>.
*   While a Gigabrain did crack it, their identity remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. Participants who submitted a guess received a testnet NFT commemorating their involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.

## Future Ambitions for Monad Games

The team and contestants expressed strong interest in a larger-scale return of Monad Games:

*   They aim to run it again, featuring more [[Community Dynamics in the Monad Ecosystem | Monad community]] members, contributors, and team members from the Monad Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   There's a desire for a "Mr. Beast style" version with 100 players, featuring eliminations to narrow down contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.
*   The success of Monad Games and its potential for expansion depend on audience engagement and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>.

The stream concluded with a "spin the wheel" segment, a staple of the "Monad in the Mornings" stream, which landed on "60-second podcast with Jessup" for a lucky community member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. The contestants offered their final thanks and shoutouts, emphasizing the collaborative spirit of the [[developments_in_the_monad_ecosystem | Monad ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

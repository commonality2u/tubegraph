When presented with the [[creative_hypothetical_scenarios | hypothetical scenario]] of [[swapping_lives_with_friends | swapping lives with one of your friends]] for a day, the choice can be a "tough one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

One individual considered [[swapping_lives_with_friends | swapping lives]] with someone named "Tunes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The motivation behind this specific swap was to post a personal "meat" from a 150,000-follower account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

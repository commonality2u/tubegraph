## Choosing a Theme Park for a Month

If given the choice to live in a theme park for a month, the individual would likely select Six Flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The primary reason for this choice is an appreciation for "thrill roller coasters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It has also been a considerable amount of time since they last visited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, making it an appealing option for an immersive, long-term stay.

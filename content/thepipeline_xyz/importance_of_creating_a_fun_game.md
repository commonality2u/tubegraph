Creating a good game is considered the primary bottleneck in game development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The core challenge lies in the act of [[challenges_in_game_development | creating a game]], which is deemed harder than creating an [[incorporating_blockchain_in_gaming | onchain game]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing Gameplay Over Blockchain Integration

The main bottleneck for gaming is to first create a fun game before putting its components [[incorporating_blockchain_in_gaming | on chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It is not advisable to begin with blockchain features like asset tracking and then try to build a game around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

A successful approach involves developing the game first, as exemplified by Roblox, which later introduced [[integrating_nfts_in_games | NFTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This sequence, where a game is established before integrating such features, "makes a lot of sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

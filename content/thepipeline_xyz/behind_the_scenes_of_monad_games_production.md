From: [[thepipeline_xyz]] <br/> 

[[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad Games]] was conceived as a "first-of-its-kind content experiment" by The Pipeline, the Monad ecosystem, and the [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The primary goal was to create a fun and engaging event, bringing together original and contributing community members of the Monad ecosystem to compete in various [[competitions_and_surprise_challenges_in_monad_games | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Key Production Personnel

The success of [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad Games]] was largely due to the efforts of several key individuals:

*   **Jessup**: The brainchild behind [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad Games]], Jessup was responsible for a significant amount of behind-the-scenes planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. His duties included setting up all the games, ensuring supplies were available for filming in Denver during ETH Denver, and coordinating the entire filming and production process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. He specifically kept the [[competitions_and_surprise_challenges_in_monad_games | challenges]] a secret from the contestants to ensure authentic [[reflections_and_reactions_from_monad_games_contestants | reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Savant**: Savant handled the "amazing job" of editing the entirety of [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad Games]], which was a huge project requiring "several hundred hours" of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. His editing incorporated "meme video style edits" that were well-received by the contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Monad Foundation Engineering Team**: This team was instrumental in building the [[onchain_elements_and_technology_used_in_monad_games | onchain components]] of [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad Games]], particularly the cipher challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. They built a "really cool app" using ZK and other [[onchain_elements_and_technology_used_in_monad_games | onchain features]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>, making it impossible to simulate the cipher offchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. Harpaul, Marcus, Box, and Mo were specifically mentioned for their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

## Filming Logistics and Challenges

The filming of [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad Games]] took place in Denver during ETH Denver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The filming period was "pretty condensed, pretty action-packed" with "a lot of moving pieces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The host expressed being "pretty stressed behind the scenes" to ensure each [[competitions_and_surprise_challenges_in_monad_games | challenge]] was filmed within the rented studio time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Surprise Challenges

A key element of the production was keeping the [[competitions_and_surprise_challenges_in_monad_games | challenges]] secret from the contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This was done intentionally to elicit authentic [[reflections_and_reactions_from_monad_games_contestants | reactions]] and prevent contestants from planning strategies in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

For instance, the psychic challenge was a complete surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. The host, Danny, expected a well-known crypto figure like Keone, Eunice, or Brian Armstrong, not a local Denver psychic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Jessup initially planned for the psychic challenge to be the third game to allow contestants to warm up, but due to schedule changes, it became the first game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. The format of the psychic reading also surprised the production team, as the psychic did not engage in conversation, which was unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

## Onchain Elements and Community Engagement

[[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad Games]] incorporated several [[onchain_elements_and_technology_used_in_monad_games | onchain elements]] to engage the community:

*   **Prediction Markets**: Prior to the premiere, prediction markets were live on the Monad testnet, powered by Opinion Labs, a product built on top of the Monad protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This was intended to build community energy and speculation around the [[competitions_and_surprise_challenges_in_monad_games | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Cipher Challenge**: A surprise [[onchain_elements_and_technology_used_in_monad_games | onchain activation]] occurred at the premiere: a cipher hidden within the [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad Games]] video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The community submitted over 30,000 guesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The cipher was intentionally designed to be "really really hard" to prevent quick resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. The engineering team built a secure application for submissions, making it impossible to simulate off-chain with bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. Participants who submitted a guess received a testnet NFT as a commemorative token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. A recap video explaining the cipher's creation and solution is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Contestants' Experience and [[reflections_and_reactions_from_monad_games_contestants | Reactions]]

The contestants filmed the show months before seeing the final edited episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

*   **KB**: Expected it to be "less cringe" than feared, appreciating the editing that showed the fun they had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Noted the existing relationships among contestants contributed positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Pre-Ballin**: Was "definitely nervous" and surprised at how great it turned out, even while feeling "a little hung over" during filming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Spam**: Impressed by the "mememory" and "meme video style edits" that turned scenes "full meme" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Intern**: Surprised by the 40-minute episode length despite only filming for 4-6 hours, crediting Savant's editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Preferred the "fun, Squid Game-esque challenges" over typical conference interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

## Future Plans

The team has ambitions to run [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad Games]] again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>, aiming to feature more [[overview_of_monad_and_its_community | Monad community]] members, contributors, and [[monads_team_and_community_development | Monad Foundation team]] members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. There are "serious ambitions" to scale the event, involve more community members and ecosystem projects, possibly even in a "Mr. Beast style" with 100 players and eliminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. This requires strong community engagement and positive reception to the existing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.

A hot wallet is characterized by its constant connection to the internet, which is why it's considered "hot" or "live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This online connectivity is the foundation of its primary advantage: convenience.

## Ease of Use

One of the great aspects of a hot wallet is that it is "super easy to use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This ease contrasts with the "little friction that happens from [[difference_between_hot_and_cold_wallets | cold wallets]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, which often require extra steps for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Ideal for Quick Transactions

Hot wallets are particularly favored by "trench Traders" because they allow for quick movement of funds "onchain [and] offchain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Their immediate accessibility makes them suitable for active trading and frequent transactions.

> [!CAUTION] Security Trade-off
> While convenient, hot wallets carry a higher [[risks_of_using_hot_wallets | risk]] of compromise compared to [[security_of_cold_wallets | cold wallets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. For this reason, it is advisable "never to keep too much" in a hot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. [[difference_between_hot_and_cold_wallets | Cold wallets]] are considered "far more secure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, making them a better choice for storing significant amounts of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The crypto ecosystem aims to decentralize many services, ultimately allowing the decentralized world to gradually take over the centralized one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">05:43:00</a>. This shift addresses fundamental issues found in traditional systems, offering solutions centered around self-sovereignty, efficiency, and accessibility.

## Self-Sovereignty and Permissionless Access

A core appeal of crypto, particularly Bitcoin in its early days, was its strong libertarian skew, focusing on the idea that banks are irresponsible with money and that individuals should have full control over their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">07:33:00</a>. Crypto empowers users with:
*   **Full control over money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">07:57:00</a>.
*   **Permissionless interaction** with financial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">08:02:00</a>.

This principle of self-sovereignty and permissionless access is seen as a key reason why the crypto space matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">08:11:00</a>.

## Disrupting Traditional Finance and Payment Systems

One of the most significant real-world problems crypto seeks to solve is the inefficiency and high costs associated with traditional finance and payment systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">08:49:00</a>.

### High Transaction Fees
Traditional payment systems, especially credit card companies, levy substantial fees (e.g., 3%) on every transaction, which burdens businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">09:31:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">13:11:00</a>. Crypto offers a solution by:
*   **Eliminating middlemen** and their fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">10:38:00</a>.
*   Enabling payments using only a phone, avoiding traditional intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">10:33:00</a>.
*   Reducing friction in currency exchange, allowing for foreign exchange (FX) swaps for as low as 50 basis points, compared to 5% or more at airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">14:02:00</a>.

### Inefficient Personal Finance Tools
Existing decentralized finance (DeFi) tools often suffer from high transaction costs and significant slippage during trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">12:06:00</a>. For new users, this can be a major deterrent to adopting decentralized technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">49:15:00</a>.
*   **Goal:** Make DeFi the standard for personal finance, encompassing banking, trading, borrowing, and lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">11:41:00</a>.
*   **Solution:** Improve efficiency by reducing slippage to single-digit basis points and lowering the cost of execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">12:22:00</a>. This requires high-performance environments like Monad, which aims for 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">11:26:00</a>.

## Interoperability and User Experience
The crypto ecosystem is characterized by multiple blockchain networks, each with its own programming languages and standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">05:53:00</a>. This creates a fragmented user experience and hinders seamless communication between different environments.

### The Interoperability Challenge
Prior to solutions like LayerZero, coordinating contracts across different chains required central coordinators, and existing bridges relied on wrapped assets, which introduced perpetual risk for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">19:31:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">19:54:00</a>.

LayerZero addresses this by:
*   Providing a transport layer that enables arbitrary contract invocation and data transfer between chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">04:48:00</a>.
*   Allowing for [[future_applications_and_scalability_in_the_crypto_space | native asset transfers]] (Omnichain Fungible Tokens or OFTs) instead of wrapped assets, which fundamentally shifts risk from the end-user to the liquidity providers, ensuring instant guaranteed finality and removing the perpetual risk associated with holding an IOU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">20:27:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">21:48:00</a>. This drastically reduces the cost of moving assets (e.g., $100 million of Tether for the cost of gas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">22:51:00</a>.

Monad, in partnership with LayerZero, emphasizes the [[importance_of_realworld_applications_in_blockchain | importance of seamless interoperability]] for new blockchains to attract users and assets from existing chains, enabling new types of applications that don't exist elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">24:31:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">24:50:00</a>.

### Security Concerns
Traditional financial systems and even some crypto protocols have vulnerabilities related to centralization and developer practices.
*   **Protection against single entity failure:** Decentralized systems offer protection against any single entity failing or becoming corrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">14:49:00</a>.
*   **Improved protocol security:** In the past, developers would often omit defensive assertions in their code to minimize gas costs, leading to security vulnerabilities and hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:30:00">50:30:00</a>. By providing high-throughput and low-cost environments, developers are less constrained by gas optimization, potentially leading to more robust and secure protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:03:00">51:03:00</a>. This addresses a significant aspect of [[crypto_security_challenges | crypto security challenges]].

## Other Areas of Disruption
Beyond finance, crypto holds potential for:
*   **Identity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">12:44:00</a>.
*   [[Community Building in Crypto | Community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">12:44:00</a>.
*   **Settlement for various transactions**, including stock trading, real estate, and vehicle transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">12:46:00</a>.

Overall, crypto aims to create a world where user actions are nearly free, enabling a wider range of applications and fostering greater adoption of decentralized technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:39:00">49:39:00</a>.

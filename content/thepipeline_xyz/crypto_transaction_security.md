## Address Poisoning Attacks

A significant threat to [[preventing_loss_in_crypto_transactions | preventing loss in crypto transactions]] is an "address poisoning attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This attack involves an individual monitoring a user's incoming crypto transactions, for example, on EtherScan or a transaction ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

The attacker sends a transaction to the victim using an address that closely mimics an address the victim frequently interacts with, such as their own wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Attackers can create addresses where the first and last characters are nearly identical to the legitimate address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. In browser views, the middle characters of an address might be obscured, making it difficult for users to spot the discrepancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The danger arises when a user, not paying close attention, might inadvertently copy the malicious address from their transaction history, mistaking it for a legitimate one they intended to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This can lead to sending a large amount of money to the attacker's wallet, often when trying to transfer funds between their own wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. People have lost substantial amounts of money due to these attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Mitigating Risks

To enhance [[steps_for_enhancing_personal_security_in_crypto | personal security]] and prevent losses from address poisoning:

*   **Be Aware** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>: Understand that these types of attacks exist.
*   **Use Direct Sources** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>: Always copy and paste addresses directly from the original source, such as your wallet, rather than from transaction history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Verify Thoroughly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>: Before sending any transaction, meticulously verify that the exact address you intend to send to is correct, checking more than just the first and last characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This vigilance is crucial for [[importance_of_user_security_in_crypto | user security]] in crypto transactions.

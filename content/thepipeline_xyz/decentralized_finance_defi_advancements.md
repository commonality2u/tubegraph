[[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]], co-founded by Chris and Mitch, was established in May 2021 with a mission to address critical infrastructure needs in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. The founders, both with significant experience in the crypto and tech sectors, recognized the burgeoning potential of DeFi and sought to build tools that would unlock new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

## Evolution of DeFi and Oracle Needs

Chris, an early employee at Circle (2013-2014), foresaw a future where "everything eventually will be tradeable on dex's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. While this opinion was controversial before "DeFi summer" in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, the rapid growth of DeFi highlighted the need for robust infrastructure. Mitch, with a background in Google Cloud security, joined Chris to build [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]] as an oracle solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

Key observations that drove [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]]'s development included:
*   The necessity for high-performance Layer 1 (L1) blockchains and cheap chains to enable new use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   The understanding that building long-tail derivatives products on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) required reliable oracle support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   Frustration with existing DeFi markets and products being hindered by high transaction fees and a lack of access to high-quality, customizable oracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

## [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]]'s Innovative Approach

[[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]] aims to offer a fully transparent and flexible oracle platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. Its core thesis centers on **programmable oracles** that allow users to build custom data flows and streams, enabling them to pull, transform, combine, and repost data as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This approach allows for the instant listing of newly minted tokens and the rapid creation of new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

### Differentiating Factors and Advantages
The main advantage of [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]] is its focus on **on-demand data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. This model eliminates the need for extensive on-chain setup before making an index on a piece of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. Users can define their desired data, transformations, and retrieval methods in a single blockchain transaction, receiving the data atomically with no latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

This capability is particularly beneficial for:
*   **Ephemeral markets**: Allowing for the creation of data feeds for short-lived events, such as games lasting only a few hours, which would not be economical for larger, more static oracle providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.
*   **Customizable products**: Users can quickly create specialized data feeds, such as a new index for a meme coin, within seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. This mirrors the strategy of centralized exchanges like Binance, which gained market share by rapidly listing new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

[[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]] supports various oracle models:
*   **Push Model**: Provider constantly streams data on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.
*   **Pull Model**: Data layer allows signed and aggregated information to be brought onto different chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.
*   **Callback Model**: Users request information on-chain, and oracles respond only when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

The poll model, where a data layer is created for information providers to bring data, is a key focus for [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]] due to its flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

### Security and Efficiency
[[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]] employs a two-tiered security layer:
1.  Verifiable hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:28:00">[34:28:00]</a>.
2.  Ultimate Oracle consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:00">[34:30:00]</a>.
This makes it one of the most secure solutions for bringing data on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>. Additionally, by operating in confidential runtimes like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), it allows data feeds to use secrets or API keys that oracles can receive but never reveal, even to operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>.

## Changing Crypto Climate and Future Trends

Since 2021, the crypto climate has evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. While initially expecting non-price feed use cases (e.g., prediction markets, on-chain insurance) to dominate, the majority of oracle-dependent activity remains in DeFi derivatives and borrow/lend protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.

However, significant growth has been observed in:
*   **GameFi and Gamey applications**: Requiring game-intensive data and secure randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.
*   **Real-World Assets (RWAs)**: A long-pushed narrative gaining traction in 2024 with projects like Ondo and Mountain Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>. The most interesting aspect is securely bringing off-chain collateral on-chain, potentially including new forms of wrapped Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>.
*   **Interest-bearing stablecoins**: Seen as a proven product-market fit that leverages crypto's unique capabilities to make payments objectively better and more efficient than Web2 rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>. This market is expected to grow significantly, especially on performant, highly scalable blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>.
*   **Increased on-chain liquidity and volume**: A significant shift from 2021, expected to continue growing as user experience and DeFi products improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.

## Collaboration with Monad and Future Vision

[[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]] was an early supporter of Monad, recognizing its potential through:
*   **Technical architecture**: The idea of paralyzable EVMs and integrating high-performance features from other ecosystems into the EVM environment is uniquely compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. This combination of speed and lower fees unlocks new use cases that were not economically viable on other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **Community**: Monad's strong and positive community is a significant factor in driving collaboration and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

[[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]] plans to be live on Monad from day one, supporting new use cases across DeFi derivatives, lending protocols, prediction markets, and [[SocialFi and decentralized social media | decentralized social media]] that require real-world data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:18:00">[33:18:00]</a>.

## Challenges in On-chain Data Management

Managing real-world data in a Web3 or on-chain environment presents unique difficulties, primarily due to **data freshness** and **front-running risks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[35:52:00]</a>. When data appears on-chain, it might have been available on other sources first, creating opportunities for malicious actors. For instance, obtaining randomness from an oracle requires careful consideration to prevent front-running within the mempool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a>.

Another challenge lies in representing complex data, like a table of events for races, succinctly and verifiably on-chain while maintaining efficiency and trustlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>. While methods like ZK verification and hardware verification exist, balancing fidelity with gas efficiency is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>.

## The Future of Crypto and On-chain Activity

The long-term outlook for crypto anticipates a 100x increase in on-chain activity over the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>. This growth will drive massive demand for bringing real-world data on-chain, requiring scalable and customizable oracle solutions like [[Pith Network and its role in decentralized finance | Switchboard]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.

Key areas for future development include:
*   **Seamless e-commerce**: Enabling the eBay of crypto, where NFTs represent physical goods that can be traded, bought, sold, and redeemed for physical items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:00">[32:18:00]</a>.
*   [[SocialFi and decentralized social media | **Decentralized social media**]]: Following the rise of platforms like Farcaster, there's excitement for more non-financial consumer applications on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>.
*   **Infinite blockchain throughput**: A vision where consensus can be built dynamically as dApps interact, allowing all nodes to store history and consensus for individual dApps, and cross-program connections extend consensus to sub-maps of the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:42:00">[39:42:00]</a>. This model could theoretically allow for infinite scaling of blockchain throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:12:00">[40:12:00]</a>.

The expansion of the on-chain economy, fueled by stablecoin growth and increased payment activity, is seen as a primary driver for the industry's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>. Achieving this requires more block space, higher performance, and a reliable "source of truth" to bring assets and concepts onto the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:00">[39:20:00]</a>.

An individual is currently working to [[focus_on_consistent_improvement | improve]] their ability to perform a solid 5-second handstand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This skill has always been something they were interested in mastering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Current Progress

While they haven't fully achieved the 5-second goal yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, their progress varies:
*   On a good day, they can hold a handstand for approximately 4 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   On an average day, the hold is closer to half a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Despite the variability, they are actively [[improving_over_time_through_practice | working towards]] consistently achieving their goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

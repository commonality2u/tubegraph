Carl Vogel, a partner at Six-Man Ventures, an early-stage crypto fund, emphasizes that building enterprise value and a company is ultimately more important than solely focusing on product creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. He notes that first-time founders often prioritize product, while successful second-time founders focus on distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

While product definition, delivery, growth, marketing, and pricing are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, founders should spend more time on company-building aspects like cash management, fundraising, brand awareness, hiring, vision, and mergers & acquisitions (M&A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Getting Out of Stealth Mode

A common mistake founders make is staying in stealth mode for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. The risk of irrelevance far outweighs the risk of someone copying your idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. Being in stealth means:
-   You are not learning and iterating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
-   You are not talking to customers or getting feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
-   You cannot build excitement or momentum for your launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
-   You miss the opportunity to define yourself as the market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
-   You waste valuable runway time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.

Examples of projects that successfully built in the open:
-   [[Community engagement and opportunities in the Monad ecosystem|Monad]]: Built hundreds of thousands of people globally before mainnet launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
-   Jito (on Solana): Quickly established itself as the leading MEV platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a> and built in the open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.
-   Photo Finish (virtual horse racing game on Solana): Engaged its [[Community Engagement and Influencers|community]] through NFT mints and mini-games during development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

[[Building and engaging with online communities|Building community]] and engaging through mini-games, quests, or podcasts can keep interest high while a product is being developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

## Finding Product Market Fit

Carl Vogel defines product market fit as finding repeatable cases of "hell yes" customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.
-   **Repeatable:** The product must serve a market consistently, not just one customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
-   **"Hell Yes":** Customers should be pulling your product, actively asking how to get it, rather than you pushing it onto them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

### How to Tell if You Have Product Market Fit
1.  **Pricing Validation:** If you apply prices and people still use the product, or if you raise prices and customers stay, it's a good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Founders often undercharge; a strategy is to "double prices until somebody says no" to find true price discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
2.  **Customer Evangelism:** Customers should be actively promoting or "evangelizing" your product to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

## Understanding Customer Needs

> [!WARNING] Customers Lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>
> Do not directly ask customers what they want, as they often cannot articulate their true needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Instead:
> -   Ask customers what they **do** in their current processes. This helps identify opportunities for building a better experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.
> -   Ask what they are **trying to accomplish**. This can reveal direct paths to value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.

Early-stage companies should avoid running extensive A/B tests due to limited runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. Make decisions quickly and iterate if necessary; the risk of taking too long outweighs the risk of shipping a slightly wrong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. Carl believes that a strong "founder market fit" (i.e., founders with deep industry experience) inherently provides intuition about what needs to be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

## Simplicity over Complexity

> [!IMPORTANT] Simplicity is more important than complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>
> -   "If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a> (Blaise Pascal/Mark Twain)
> -   "Make the requirements less dumb." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a> (Elon Musk)
> -   "Do one thing uniquely well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a> (Peter Thiel)

**Problems with Complex Products:**
-   **Decreasing Customer Attention Span:** Products have limited time to make an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.
-   **Technical Debt:** Adding features without removing old ones creates maintenance burden and conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
-   **Unclear Value Proposition:** Too many features obscure what the product is truly good for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>.
-   **Serving Too Many Customers:** Complex products often try to cater to too many different customer types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

**How to Tell if Your Product is Too Complex:**
-   Can you describe your value proposition in two sentences (or 15 seconds)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>
-   Can customers have a "delight moment" within 60 seconds of onboarding? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>
-   Is there a singular, clear call to action within the app? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>
-   Do you consistently add features without ever deprecating old ones? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>

## Effective Referral Strategies

In crypto, referral codes are popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>. However, a referral should not just be a code. It should immediately drive users into the core product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

Example: Pay, a private crypto Venmo, required users to be paid by someone to onboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. This immediately gave new users a balance, unlocking the app's value proposition (sending money, claiming points, interacting with DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

Similarly, for a betting app, being invited to join a specific bet is more compelling than simply downloading an app with thousands of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. The referral process should be integrated with the product's core value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

## Airdrops and Market Share

Regarding airdrops, Carl notes that while they can incentivize specific behaviors and test platform scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>, they should not be the sole reason people use a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.
-   Focus airdrops on existing, core product users rather than using them as an acquisition tool for new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.
-   Distribute a smaller percentage (e.g., 10-15%) of tokens via airdrop to retain treasury for future engagement or customer growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
-   Prioritize winning market share in growing markets over immediate revenue, as long as there's a clear path to monetization once market conditions improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

[[Importance of sharing your business message|Brand awareness]] is part of company building, and it's distinct from product marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. In crypto's mimetic culture, a strong company brand is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

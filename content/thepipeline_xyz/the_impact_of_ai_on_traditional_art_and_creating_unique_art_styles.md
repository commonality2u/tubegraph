The conversation highlights the evolving landscape of digital art, particularly the tension and interplay between human-made art and artificial intelligence (AI) generated content. Bold Leonidas, a comic artist, discusses his journey and philosophy, emphasizing the unique value of human creation in an increasingly automated world.

## A Stance Against AI in Art

Bold Leonidas initially began creating comics as a sporadic endeavor, but committed to producing at least one piece every day for over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This commitment stemmed from a deeper conviction about the role of human artists in the age of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

Bold, originally a traditional artist, observed that [[integration_of_ai_and_ar_in_gaming | AI]] was "killing it" in the art space, making it seem pointless to continue traditional art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. He noted the emergence of "AI photography collections" and questioned the authenticity, asking, "what the f*ck, just take a picture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

His artistic approach became a direct "antithesis of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. He purposefully leaves in "mistakes and human errors" in his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This deliberate imperfection serves to differentiate his work from AI, answering the question: "How do you prove that you're a person anymore?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. His goal is to create timely jokes that AI cannot replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

A year prior, it was common to distinguish [[integration_of_ai_and_ar_in_gaming | AI art]] from human art, but now it's easier to prompt image creation, making human-made art stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. The title of "non-AI artist," which didn't exist a year ago, now describes Bold Leonidas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. This shift suggests that human-drawn art, with its inherent connection, "can't be handed over to some [[integration_of_ai_and_ar_in_gaming | AI]] creation" and will likely "stand the test of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

## Consistency, Evolution, and Unique Style

Bold's commitment to daily creation is partly inspired by Beeple's "everyday" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. However, Bold differentiates himself by producing a *minimum* of one piece every 24 hours, often creating two or three daily, and has produced around 1,500 individual comics in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. This rapid output allowed him to "speedrun" his improvement and refine his style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

Initially, Bold's comics focused almost entirely on the [[NFT market trends and cultural impact | NFT ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. However, recognizing the decline in [[NFT market trends and cultural impact | NFT]] interest and volume, he consciously pivoted to address broader crypto topics, including trading dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.

A key aspect of his unique style involves redrawing pre-existing memes. After an intense night of creating 150 memes for a Discord competition, he realized that most memes lack clear ownership of their individual images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. This realization led him to the strategy of redrawing classic memes in his distinct style, allowing him to "own" the visual space and ensure that his work is recognizable as his own when shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>. This ability to reformat existing memes while maintaining a unique artistic signature provides an infinite source of ideas, mitigating [[incremental_improvement_in_creative_work | artist's block]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Creative Challenges

Despite his prolific output, Bold admits to experiencing "impostor syndrome" and "writer's block" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>. When facing these challenges, he often resorts to his "dumpster dig" strategy of scrolling through pre-existing memes for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:22:00">[29:22:00]</a>.

He strives to utilize the comic format to its fullest, prioritizing visuals that can only work as a comic over simple dialogue exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. He avoids repeating the same format consecutively, constantly seeking variation to keep his audience engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:00">[31:48:00]</a>. This drive for continuous improvement and the refusal to "become wallpaper" is crucial for maintaining relevance and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.

Monad Games presents a high-stakes competition where five contestants battle to earn test net tokens (T-Mo), with the winner receiving $5,000 to give away to their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The contest is designed to test not only skill but also [[psychological_elements_and_strategy_in_game_contests | psychological elements]] and influence within a social context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Community Engagement Strategies

Before the main competition, an initial giveaway of 50 test net tokens is offered to 10 lucky winners who drop their wallet address in the first thousand comments of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Viewers are also encouraged to like, subscribe, follow, and clip the video, highlighting direct [[community_engagement_and_strategies_for_rarebetsports | engagement strategies]] for online content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## Measuring Social Influence

A key challenge within Monad Games directly addresses social influence. Contestants are asked to self-rank themselves from most to least influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, based on factors like "professional [[engagement_strategies_within_socialfi_platforms | engagement farmers]]" and "banger original posts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. One contestant mentions having a six-figure follower count as a marker of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, while another cites "yappingness" (talkativeness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

To provide an objective measure, a professional psychic is brought in to conduct 5-minute readings with each contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. They are then re-ranked based purely on her intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   Matching one's own placement earns 500 Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   Being placed in the number one spot earns 1,000 Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

Each contestant is given 15 seconds to plead their case for why they believe they are the most influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This highlights how individuals perceive and articulate their own influence.

## Pitching Startup Ideas (Hot or Not)

The "Hot or Not" challenge requires contestants to pitch a fictional startup idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This simulates a real-world scenario of convincing an audience, a key aspect of influence. The challenge incorporates varying risk levels linked to consuming spicy food:
*   Jelly beans: 200 Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>
*   World's hottest chocolate: 500 Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>
*   One Chip Challenge: 2,000 Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>

Contestants are judged by their peers, emphasizing peer influence and perception in evaluating ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. One contestant's pitch for "Couch Confessional," an AI priest, impressed the judges and earned a high score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. The winning pitch earned 1,500 Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

## "Split or Steal" - A Game of Trust

The final game, "Split or Steal," is a [[psychological_elements_and_strategy_in_game_contests | psychological challenge]] worth 2,500 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. Contestants privately choose to "split" or "steal."
*   If everyone splits, they each get 500 Mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   If only one steals, they take all tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
*   If two or more steal, splitters get everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
*   If three or more steal, no one wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

This game tests trust and individual strategy within a group dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. The winner, Professor Pipelines, ultimately decided to split his $5,000 prize among three other community members, a gesture of community appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

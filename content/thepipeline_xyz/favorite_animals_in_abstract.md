When asked about their favorite Monad animal, an individual involved with the Monad ecosystem expressed a preference for the more abstract and less popular choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Preference for Abstract and Unpopular

A particular fondness was stated for animals that are considered "really abstract" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> or "not at all popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> among the [[launch_of_consumerfocused_blockchain_chain_Abstract | Monad]] community.

## Specific Example: Li ra

The specific Monad animal chosen as a favorite was "Li ra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The reasoning behind this choice is that Li ra "almost never gets mentioned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, making its unpopularity a reason for its selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

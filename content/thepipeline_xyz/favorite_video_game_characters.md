When asked about a preferred video game character, Alex from the ecosystem team at Monad shared his choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Character of Choice

Alex would choose to be [[choosing_a_video_game_character_persona | Mario]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Reasoning

His reasoning for this choice is rooted in long-term familiarity and nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Mario has been a "pal" for many years, as Alex's first gaming experience began with Mario on a Nintendo Entertainment System back in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

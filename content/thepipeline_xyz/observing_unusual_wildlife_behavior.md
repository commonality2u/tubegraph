Observing unusual patterns in wildlife can prompt questions about what constitutes a normal or abnormal sighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Bald Eagle Sightings

One hypothetical scenario explores how many bald eagles one would need to see in a single day before concluding that "something weird is going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The suggested threshold for an unusual occurrence is ten bald eagles in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, acknowledging that this number represents "a lot of bald eagles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

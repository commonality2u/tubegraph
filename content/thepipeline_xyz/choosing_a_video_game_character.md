When asked which video game character they would choose to be, one individual stated they would likely pick "some anime looking one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, since they do not play video games, they were unsure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. They suggested [[favorite_video_game_characters | Zelda]] as a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The advancement of blockchain technology, particularly in achieving [[high performance blockchains | high performance]], is poised to significantly impact various on-chain verticals such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and social applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Key Advancements and Their Impact

### Transaction Speed (TPS)
One of the most notable impacts of [[high performance blockchains | high-performance blockchain technology]] is the drastic increase in transactions per second (TPS). The prospect of being able to get liquidated at 10,000 TPS, rather than a mere 10 to 1,000 TPS, highlights the shift in processing capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

### Enhanced User Experience
[[high performance blockchains | High performance]] enables a more frictionless user experience (UX) when interacting with the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This is particularly exciting for areas like gaming, where real-time interactions and trading of NFTs can become a seamless part of the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

### Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs)
A significant differentiator enabled by [[high performance blockchains | high-performance blockchain technology]] is the practical implementation of Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs) on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.

Currently, the majority of on-chain crypto trading is conducted through Automated Market Makers (AMMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. This is primarily due to high gas fees, which make it unprofitable for market makers to provide liquidity on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. However, with sufficiently low fees and high TPS, market makers can profitably provide on-chain liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. This shift leads to much deeper liquidity and significantly better execution for traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

The transition to 10,000 TPS represents a massive jump that enables new use cases which can only exist within this [[high performance blockchains | high-performance execution environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. Once users experience this level of performance, they are unlikely to revert to older systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

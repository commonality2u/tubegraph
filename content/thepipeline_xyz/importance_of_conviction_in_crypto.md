Conviction is considered paramount within the cryptocurrency industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Many ideas that initially seem outlandish or "ridiculous" are later proven correct over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Conviction and Resilience

A significant aspect of crypto involves maintaining conviction, holding through challenges, and continuing to build, even when events might cause a loss of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While adapting to changing markets is crucial, individuals should remain true to the core thesis and beliefs behind their involvement in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Historical Example

One example of an evolving thesis is the original idea of Bitcoin being used for payments, a common thought process around 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Although Bitcoin is not primarily seen this way now, that foundational payments thesis has, in some respects, manifested through the emergence of stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Monad's public testnet is launching as a showcase of the technology that has been built over several years, marking what is seen as a starting line rather than a finish line for innovation in blockchain performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:34">[01:34:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

## Monad's Approach to [[optimizing_blockchain_performance | Performance Optimization]]

Monad has taken a unique approach to blockchain development by building its protocol entirely from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This strategy provides more technical control over the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, allowing specific control over implementations like memory allocation and disk interaction to achieve the best [[optimizing_blockchain_performance | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. While some open-source projects are used, Monad did not fork an existing client because it would have required too many modifications, negating the benefits of ongoing maintenance and new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

Previous efforts in EVM performance focused on areas like state sync performance rather than raw execution throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, largely because Ethereum itself is arbitrarily rate-limited to a low throughput to maintain low node requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Monad, however, was envisioned as a [[the_importance_of_high_throughput_blockchains | high-performance EVM chain]] with no design restrictions other than 100% EVM compatibility, aiming to maximize network and hardware performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. This vision also includes targeting consumer-grade nodes (e.g., a $1,000 PC) rather than expensive server machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Building a high-performance system from scratch is a massive undertaking, requiring specialized low-level system engineers who are difficult to find, as they typically work in big tech, silicon manufacturing, or high-frequency trading firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

### [[challenges_in_blockchain_database_performance_optimization | Challenges in Blockchain Database Performance Optimization]]

Key [[challenges_in_blockchain_database_performance_optimization | challenges]] in Monad's development involved achieving concurrent execution to leverage multi-core machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Unlike most existing clients that are single-core for transaction execution, Monad aims to keep multiple transactions in progress simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. This requires intricate pipelining to manage dependencies between transactions within a block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

A major innovation centers around the database. [[State access bottlenecks in blockchain | Disk access is a significant bottleneck]], taking approximately 30 microseconds or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Sequential disk access quickly accumulates time, leading to idle CPU time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Monad's main innovations focus on executing transactions to always keep the machine busy, particularly by optimizing for disk access by building a custom database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. This "pipelining" approach, likened to a washing machine and dryer analogy, allows for doing multiple steps across multiple objects at the same time, maximizing hardware utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

## Benchmarking [[the_importance_of_high_throughput_blockchains | High Throughput Blockchains]]

Benchmarks for Transactions Per Second (TPS) can often be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Simple operations like native token transfers are the easiest for a blockchain to perform, and even unoptimized, single-core clients can achieve 50,000 TPS on such artificial benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. ERC20 token transfers, while slightly more complex due to state updates, are still relatively simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

Real-world Ethereum activity involves more taxing protocols like AMMs, lending, and especially expensive zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, which have cost hundreds of dollars per transaction in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Monad's goal is to handle this "real usage" by replaying Ethereum history, which provides a realistic test of the system's ability to cope with complex and expensive computations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. For example, one team on Monad's devnet simulated 3 trillion gas usage, equivalent to about 30 days of Ethereum throughput, in just a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

Misleading marketing in the blockchain space often involves manipulating benchmarking conditions, such as:
*   The nature of transfers or transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   The hardware used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   The geographic location of nodes and stake weight distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Some projects might have distributed nodes but centralize stake weight, effectively creating a geographically co-located consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

Monad rejects these practices, prioritizing technology and pushing the decentralization-performance tradeoff curve forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. They intentionally set up highly stake-weighted nodes in distant locations (e.g., Singapore and New York) to test and optimize the system under worst-case conditions, respecting the physical limitations of data transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Metrics that appear to violate the laws of physics are likely achieved through arrangements that compromise decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

## What [[need_for_performant_blockchains | High Performance]] Unlocks

Ultimately, a blockchain offers a shared global state where anyone can build and distribute applications globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Monad aims to be a performant version of this, providing built-in payment rails and programmability to support millions or hundreds of millions of users with existing on-chain assets and digital identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

[[applications_and_potential_of_highperformance_blockchains | High performance]] enables several specific verticals:
*   **High-Fidelity DeFi:** Scaling personal finance to hundreds of millions of users with cheap transaction fees and low slippage, allowing liquidity providers to offer efficient on-chain markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   **Consumer Space Applications:** Any consumer-targeted application requiring scale to hundreds of millions of users and over a billion transactions per day, such as decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
    *   This is especially relevant where applications may sponsor gas fees for users. Cheaper gas reduces the burden on developers, enabling sustainable business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Examples include marketplaces for health data, compute (CPU/GPU), cameras, and other device networks where consumers contribute resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

The [[the_future_of_highperformance_blockchains | future of high-performance blockchains]] will see both predictable advancements, like more efficient DeFi, and unpredictable new applications, similar to how increased internet bandwidth led to YouTube and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Areas like AI agents and inscriptions are examples of emerging, unpredictable use cases that could thrive on high-throughput chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

## The [[the_evolution_of_blockchain_and_infrastructure_scaling | Evolution of Blockchain and Infrastructure Scaling]]

Monad's devnet served as a feedback loop for early testers and infrastructure providers, helping to identify missing features or use patterns that required adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. The public testnet is the next phase, providing a public product for everyone to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

The goal of the public testnet is to:
*   Exercise the technology and gather more feedback on the client's strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.
*   Showcase the power of the technology and the applications built on top of Monad that leverage its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
*   Allow the community to use and test the chain in real-world scenarios, including high-stress events like NFT mints or concurrent transactions from geographically dispersed users, to see how the system handles nearing its limits gracefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. A smooth degradation experience, where transactions might be slightly delayed but still go through, is preferred over obscure errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

Monad recognizes that launching the network is just the beginning. The core team views it as "crossing the starting line" rather than the finish line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. There is a "massive queue of ideas" for future optimizations, rewrites to improve existing components, and ongoing research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This includes new features for usability, privacy, and further decentralization, with a plan to scale the client to support thousands of nodes, on par with Ethereum and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. The long-term vision involves continuous innovation, moving beyond just delivering high performance and EVM compatibility to introduce many additional improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

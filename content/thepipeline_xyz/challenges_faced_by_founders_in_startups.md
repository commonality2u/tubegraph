For [[early_stage_founders | early stage founders]], the concept of leadership is often set aside in favor of intense hands-on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A founder's primary responsibility is to handle "literally everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This approach can be counterintuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The "Do Everything" Imperative

Initially, founders must be prepared to tackle all tasks themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   Coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Administrative duties, like cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Dealing with legal matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Managing accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

## The "Great Soldier" Philosophy

The most successful founders, who eventually become leaders, began as "great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The advice for new founders is to embrace this "soldier" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. By becoming highly proficient in fighting many battles on the ground, founders gain the necessary experience to understand how to effectively hire other team members later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

> "A great warrior would become a great leader, but a great leader who's never been on the ground fighting those battles, not very great." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

While there is ample support for those seeking to grow into a [[role_of_leadership_in_startups | leadership role]], there is a distinct lack of resources for individuals aspiring to become highly effective "soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## [[transition_from_founder_to_leader | Transitioning from Soldier to Leader]]

A natural [[transition_from_founder_to_leader | transition period]] occurs where founders evolve from being active "soldiers" into leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This progression emphasizes the importance of hands-on experience, as effective leaders typically have a deep understanding of the ground-level challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

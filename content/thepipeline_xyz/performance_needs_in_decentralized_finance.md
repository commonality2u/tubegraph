The inspiration for creating [[monads_highperformance_blockchain_features | Monad]] arose from significant performance challenges observed within the [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | decentralized finance (DeFi)]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This realization stemmed from prior experience in high-frequency trading and direct engagement with [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | DeFi]] projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of Monad

The founders of [[monads_highperformance_blockchain_features | Monad]], James and his colleague, first met in 2014 while working on a high-frequency trading team at Jump Trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Their role involved building a complete trading system from scratch, processing packets from exchanges, making rapid trading decisions, and sending orders back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This field is intensely competitive; faster decision-making and order placement determine success in taking liquidity or securing a queue position for passive orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This environment demanded continuous system improvements, latency reduction, and the creation of highly performant systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Identifying Gaps in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

By 2021, the team transitioned to Jump's crypto division, immediately engaging with [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | DeFi]] projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. During approximately six months of working specifically on [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | Solana DeFi]], they identified a substantial demand for more [[high_performance_blockchains | performant blockchains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

### The Call for a Performant EVM

A critical need was recognized for a more [[blockchain_performance_optimization | performant EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Existing [[blockchain_performance_optimization | EVM implementations]] were largely inefficient and had not undergone the level of [[blockchain_performance_optimization | optimization]] seen in high-frequency trading systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The team's background in [[blockchain_performance_optimization | building systems from the ground up to be very performant]] made them uniquely suited to address this problem, despite anticipating it would be a lengthy endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

The initial inspiration for [[monads_highperformance_blockchain_features | Monad]] was a combination of their experience in building high-performance systems for different tasks and their direct interaction with [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | Solana]] and Ethereum, highlighting significant performance discrepancies and the potential for substantial [[blockchain_performance_optimization | optimizations]], particularly within the [[blockchain_performance_optimization | EVM]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

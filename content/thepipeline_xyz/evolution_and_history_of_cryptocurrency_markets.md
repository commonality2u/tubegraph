Dan Matuszewski, co-founder of CMS Holdings, a VC firm specializing in blockchain and cryptocurrency, shares insights into the historical development and current state of the crypto market. His experience provides a unique perspective on the major events and shifts that have shaped the industry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>

## Early Days: Bitcoin's Emergence and Market Structure (2012-2013)

Dan's involvement with crypto began in late 2012 and early 2013, while working at a hedge fund. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> Bitcoin was recognized within the trading community, though its purpose was largely perceived as a [[history_of_bitcoin_as_a_payment_method | payments system]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> While the "store of value" narrative existed, it wasn't as dominant as it is today. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>

Early market activity was characterized by automated trading to capture bid-offer spreads, despite low aggregate trading volumes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>

The market was heavily centralized around **Mt. Gox**, which accounted for approximately 80% of the volume. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a> Other exchanges like Kraken launched around 2013, and Coinbase initially operated solely as a brokerage, with its exchange model appearing years later. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>

### Challenges of Early Exchanges

The early crypto landscape was plagued by instability among exchanges. Many had a short "half-life" of about six months, either being hacked or shut down due to banking issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a> Noteworthy examples include Bitfloor and several Canadian exchanges that collapsed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>

The collapse of Mt. Gox significantly impacted the market, leading to a prolonged period of quiet activity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>

## The "Dark Period" (2014-2015)

Following the Mt. Gox collapse, the period between 2014 and 2015 saw a significant lull in the crypto market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a> Trading volumes dwindled, with platforms like Bitfinex, the dominant liquidity venue at the time, seeing as little as 1,100 Bitcoin traded daily at around $200 each. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a> This meant the entire industry's aggregate trading volume on the top exchange was less than a million dollars, leading many to believe it was "over." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> This environment prompted some early crypto companies, like Circle, to pivot away from crypto, a decision that later proved to be poor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>

During this time, the market was small enough that one could conceptualize almost everything happening, and it was easy to know nearly everyone involved in trading. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a> The only information asymmetry was with Asia, a characteristic that still persists to some extent today. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>

Altcoins existed but had little value and were mostly carbon copies of the Bitcoin codebase. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>

## The Rise of Ethereum and the ICO Boom

The market began to recover with the growing popularity of Ethereum (ETH) and the subsequent ICO (Initial Coin Offering) boom, particularly around 2017. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a> This marked a significant shift, as information flow exploded, making it impossible to keep up with everything. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a> Companies like Circle, which had previously only traded Bitcoin, had to start trading ETH by 2016 due to client demand, indicating ETH's rising importance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a> The success of ETH as a second major asset validated the idea of other cryptocurrencies gaining value, leading to the funding of numerous new chains. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>

This period marked the [[crypto_ecosystem_developments | growth and trends on crypto Twitter]], which became a significant source of information and community interaction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

## Modern Market Dynamics (2024)

Compared to 2015, the crypto market in 2024 has grown massively and horizontally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a> It's now impossible to pay attention to all the information, and there are many more types of assets to consider. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>

### Market Drivers

Current market movements often correlate with asset beta: those that experienced harder declines in the bear market tend to rebound faster and higher in percentage terms during bull markets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a> This "everything's ripping" phenomenon is typical of bull markets and doesn't necessarily signify a "new regime." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>

A key observation in market cycles is the "hot ball of money" phenomenon: when Bitcoin and Ethereum rally, the generated liquidity often disperses into the "corners of the world," funding various altcoins. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a> Identifying which altcoins matter in each cycle is crucial, as the dominant ones change. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a> This [[dynamics_of_coin_creation_in_the_crypto_market | rise of meme coins in crypto]] and other niche assets is a prominent feature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>

### Institutional Adoption

Institutional interest in crypto is growing, viewing it as an uncorrelated asset that can provide alpha (excess returns). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a> Large asset managers seek ways to add returns beyond traditional equities, and Bitcoin, being uncorrelated and trending upwards, fits this need. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a> Crypto can be shoehorned into portfolios as a minority position, adding alpha over time to existing fixed income and equity baskets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>

### Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs

The potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF is seen as highly significant, as it provides access to the "passive flows" of traditional finance (TradFi) products like equities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a> This opens up a new pool of potential buyers who were previously unable or slowed down from owning the asset directly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>

However, there may be initial "noise" with its launch, as early inflows might not meet exaggerated expectations, and it takes time for such funds to integrate into traditional investment advisory pipelines. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a> Nonetheless, it's considered a significant long-term boost for the asset class and industry due to passive capital inflows. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>

The competition among providers for Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM) is expected to be fierce, leading to substantial advertising and non-sketchy exposure for crypto. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>

An Ethereum ETF is considered likely within about a year, especially if the Bitcoin ETF sees significant AUM. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a> However, its structure might be more complicated due to staking considerations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a> Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, further altcoin ETFs are not anticipated for some time, as the typical cadence for SEC approval seems to be CME futures for a year or two, followed by an ETF. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>

## Trading Experiences

Dan highlights the COVID-19 crash as the "craziest period of trading" he has witnessed, where venues like Bitfinex effectively went to zero and FTX stopped working. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a> Ethereum basis swung wildly (e.g., +20% in annual terms in half an hour), and counterparty risk became paramount as it was unclear who was solvent after events like the Three Arrows Capital collapse. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a> This period also coincided with extreme volatility in traditional markets, with commodities going negative and equities hitting limit down. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>

The 48 hours after FTX officially shut down were also described as "ridiculous," with traders attempting to "lose money" in their FTX accounts to gain it elsewhere as a way to extract funds from the failing exchange. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>

## Trading Philosophies

*   **"Do you want to make money or do you want to be right?"** The market will often do what it needs to do, regardless of fundamental analysis. Fighting the market (e.g., shorting assets that are flying for "no reason") often leads to losses due to irrational price action. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>
*   **Avoid excessive leverage**: Leverage can lead to catastrophic losses, especially due to unforeseen "second-order and third-order effects" in volatile markets (e.g., one lender dying causing a cascade across all lenders). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>
*   **Trade less**: Often, simply holding an asset based on a thesis is more effective than overtrading, which can "undo your own right decision." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a> While some individuals achieve success with high leverage, this is a selection bias, as hundreds or thousands of others are wiped out for every success story. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>

## The [[evolution_of_blockchain_and_infrastructure_scaling | Evolution of Crypto Wallets]]

The conversation touches on the ongoing advancements in blockchain technology and the debate around **parallel EVMs**. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a> Projects like Monad are viewed with interest due to their compelling pitch for addressing scalability, though skepticism remains among some technical experts, reminiscent of early doubts about Ethereum and Solana. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a> The market awaits for the "rubber to hit the road" with live products to validate claims, as many projects currently apply the "parallel EVM" label for marketing purposes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a> The broader [[evolution_of_sentiment_towards_memecoins_in_the_venture_capital_space | crypto ecosystem developments]] and innovation continue to push the boundaries of what is thought possible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>

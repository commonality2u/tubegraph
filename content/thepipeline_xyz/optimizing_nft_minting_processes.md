Optimizing the process of minting Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is crucial to ensure system stability during periods of high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The goal is to handle scenarios where a large number of users, potentially 100,000 concurrent individuals attempting 100 transactions per second, simultaneously try to mint an NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Challenges in High-Stress Minting Events

High-stress events, such as popular NFT mints, can lead to system failures if not adequately prepared for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Common issues include:
*   Remote Procedure Call (RPC) failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   Transactions being reverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

These problems often surface on social media when things go wrong during high-demand events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Such experiences, like those observed on Solana in the fall of 2021, highlight the unpredictable nature of user behavior, where people globally "spam click" mint buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This level of demand can be challenging to anticipate in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Optimization Strategies

Continuous [[optimization_strategies_for_blockchain_clients | optimization strategies]] are necessary because it is impossible to anticipate every possible stress scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. By monitoring data, teams can further [[blockchain_performance_optimization | optimize performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The objective is to enable the system to withstand extreme load without needing to make excuses for performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Future Considerations: AI and Stress Testing

Future testing and [[blockchain_performance_optimization | optimization]] efforts could incorporate AI agents on testnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The combination of AI with high throughput scenarios could yield valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Incentivizing AI to intentionally stress-test and even crash the system could help uncover vulnerabilities that human-driven tests might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This approach simulates "robots clicking" instead of just human interactions, pushing the system to its limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Monad is progressing through significant milestones towards the launch of its Testnet and ultimately, its Mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. These developments are crucial for the project's broader go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

## Devnet: The Internal Foundation

The recent announcement of [[Monads Devnet announcement and significance | Devnet]] marked a huge week for Monad supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. [[Monads Devnet announcement and significance | Devnet]] is defined as a fully functioning blockchain environment specifically for the Monad blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. It represents a significant milestone, being the unification of all four optimizations of the tech stack, including the consensus engine (MonadBFT) and the execution engine with parallelized execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

Currently, [[Monads Devnet announcement and significance | Devnet]] is an internal core team environment and not yet accessible to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Its primary purpose is to allow the Monad team to "dog food" the blockchain internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This process involves identifying the system's strengths and areas for continued optimization through iterations of code development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

A key highlight of [[Monads Devnet announcement and significance | Devnet]] has been achieving 10,000 TPS (transactions per second) on the EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Monad measures TPS using real, recent Ethereum data, replaying those transactions on the Monad blockchain to provide a more accurate reflection of true blockchain performance, rather than just theoretical maximums based on simple transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This demonstrates the potential of Monad's [[Monads HighPerformance Blockchain Features | optimizations]] in a real-world context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

## The Upcoming Testnet

The next major milestone for Monad, right around the corner from [[Monads Devnet announcement and significance | Devnet]], is the [[Monad testnet launch | Testnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:49">[02:47:49]</a>. This will be a phased [[Monad testnet launch | Testnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:53">[02:51:53]</a>, through which Monad will be able to share more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:55">[02:53:55]</a>. This phased approach will allow for gradual expansion and continued improvements of the Monad blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

## Launching a Strong Mainnet

The ultimate goal for Monad is to "press forward and launch a really strong Mainnet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>. The Monad team is continuously building out all areas of the company, especially engineering and ecosystem development, to support the growing community and prepare for Mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>.

### The Role of Community and Ecosystem

The success of the Mainnet relies heavily on the broader developer and crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. Monad co-founder and COO, Eunice, uses an analogy to describe this symbiotic relationship:
> "Mona blockchain you can consider that as like a skeleton... the ecosystem of applications of tooling and infra those are like the muscles and the tendons that you know wrap around the skeleton... but the community the people that's like the Beating Heart of manad it's like what makes you know the blood flow and what makes a a living breathing body come to life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>.

This highlights that while Monad provides the optimized infrastructure, the community and applications are what bring it to life and make it truly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>. Conversations are already underway with project teams interested in expanding to the Monad ecosystem or building new Monad-native applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

### Future Engagement

In the year ahead, Monad plans to increase its physical presence at various conferences and may even host its own events in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. There have also been discussions about potentially hosting a hackathon, which is further down the roadmap but still a part of the plan to engage the developer community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>. These efforts aim to foster greater involvement within the broader ecosystem community and share what Monad can offer to developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

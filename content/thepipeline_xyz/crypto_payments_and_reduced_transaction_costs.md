From: [[thepipeline_xyz]] <br/> 

One of the most pressing real-world problems that [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | crypto]] is poised to solve is the high cost and inefficiency of traditional payment systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The early thesis for [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | crypto]] was to disrupt money, banking, and the financial industry, offering permissionless access and self-sovereignty in financial interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Challenges with Traditional Payments

In the Western world, credit cards are extremely prevalent, but credit card companies levy significant fees from every transaction, often around 3% of the transferred cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This represents a substantial cost for businesses, both small and large, that must bear these fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. The combined market capitalization of Visa and Mastercard, estimated at a trillion dollars, highlights the immense scale of these charges, largely extracted from small and medium businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

## Crypto as a Solution

[[evolution_of_bitcoin_as_a_payment_method | Crypto]] provides a mechanism for individuals to pay for services directly using their phones, effectively bypassing these costly middlemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This capability makes payments a "killer app" for [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### Global Impact
*   **Developed World**: [[evolution_of_bitcoin_as_a_payment_method | Crypto]] offers a clear path to disrupt the high fees associated with credit card transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Undeveloped World**: In parts of the world where credit cards are less common, [[evolution_of_bitcoin_as_a_payment_method | crypto]] is already widely used for payments, particularly Tether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Enhancing Performance for Widespread Adoption

For [[evolution_of_bitcoin_as_a_payment_method | crypto]] to truly compete with existing payment processing systems, it must be able to handle transactions at a comparable scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Monad, for instance, is designed to be a network capable of achieving this, targeting 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

## Impact on Personal Finance and DeFi

Beyond direct payments, [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | crypto]] and [[innovations_in_decentralized_finance | decentralized finance (DeFi)]] hold significant potential for personal finance, encompassing banking, trading, borrowing, and lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. To deliver value, these systems need to offer an experience that is at least equal to, or ideally better than, centralized personal finance tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This involves:
*   **Reduced Slippage**: Minimizing the difference between the expected price of a trade and the executed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. The goal is to reduce slippage from the frequently seen 1-5% in [[innovations_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] to single-digit basis points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
*   **Improved Cost of Execution**: Making the cost of on-chain trading comparable to or better than centralized environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

Achieving these improvements requires a highly performant environment, enabling market makers to quote very tightly and reduce spreads, ultimately providing users with a much better execution experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

## Broader Settlement Applications

Beyond direct payments, the underlying [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_technology | blockchain technology]] also holds potential for general settlement processes across various transactions, such as stock trading or the transfer of assets like houses or cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

Elixir Protocol, founded by Phillip, is an early builder within the Monad ecosystem, aiming to address critical liquidity challenges in [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | decentralized finance (DeFi)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The protocol provides a decentralized and trustless solution for supplying liquidity to order book exchanges, a space historically dominated by a few centralized market-making firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Founding and Vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

Phillip, who started in crypto in 2016 by founding the Carnegie Mellon Blockchain Group, identified a significant gap in the market while running his previous company, Block Venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. He observed that numerous blockchain startups and [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | decentralized exchanges (DEXs)]] struggled to find market makers for their order book pairs, relying on a handful of centralized entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These centralized market makers often generated profit not from sophisticated algorithms (which usually broke even), but by charging exchanges and protocols for access to their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Recognizing the potential for a decentralized alternative, Phillip conceived Elixir to create a trustless protocol that could offer the same market-making services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Elixir Protocol: How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>

Elixir is built as a modular DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) Network designed to power order book liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Its core function is to allow anyone to supply liquidity to order books, which the protocol then algorithmically manages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The process involves:
*   **Algorithmic Liquidity Deployment**: The protocol takes supplied liquidity and automatically builds and deploys it on order books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This process aims to tighten bid-ask spreads and deepen the liquidity for specific trading pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Similar to AMMs**: The system is designed to provide a "near identical risk-return profile" to that of Uniswap V2 for liquidity providers (LPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Just like in an Automated Market Maker (AMM), users deposit tokens into a pool and earn rewards (APR) from the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Trustless Operation**: The protocol achieves consensus once per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, with fraud proofs posted on the Ethereum mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The signing of orders occurs at the smart contract level, meaning Elixir's team never has direct access to user funds, which remain in a smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This ensures a fully custodial and trustless environment for LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Elixir's goal is not to run proprietary trading strategies or always be "top of book," but rather to be a "trustless liquidity backbone" that exchanges can rely on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.

## Impact and Integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

Elixir has demonstrated significant impact by boosting efficiency, traction, and volume for integrated protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Exchanges, which often spend over a million dollars monthly on long-term liquidity provider incentive programs distributed to a few large firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, can now integrate Elixir to allow their end-users to supply liquidity and earn a share of these existing incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Key native integrations include:
*   Vertex Fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   Rabbid X Fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
*   Injective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
*   Blue Fin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
*   Orderly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
*   Hyperliquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>
*   Avo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>
*   NFT Perps Turbine (forthcoming, fully on-chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>

Elixir currently powers approximately 30% of order book liquidity on Vertex and anticipates powering over half on Rabbid X, 30-40% on Blue Fin and Orderly, and half on Hyperliquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Elixir's Role in [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | DeFi Advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>

### Bridging AMMs and Order Books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>
Elixir is seen as facilitating the transition from AMMs to efficient centralized limit order books (CLOBs) while simultaneously decentralizing the market-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. AMMs were an important [[innovations_in_decentralized_finance | innovation]] for decentralized token swapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, but order books offer significant advantages like drastically reduced slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

Even leading AMMs are evolving towards an order book model. Uniswap V3 introduced concentrated liquidity (bands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, and V4 includes "hooks" allowing for limit orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The main advantage of AMMs was passive liquidity supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, which Elixir now brings to order books. Order books remain dominant for large perpetuals DEXs and centralized exchanges due to near-zero cost order updates and faster infrastructure via APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

### Addressing Liquidity Challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>
One of the biggest issues in [[performance_needs_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi liquidity]] is "toxic flow," where passive LPs can lose money due to arbitrageurs exploiting price discrepancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Solutions in AMMs involve dynamic fee mechanisms (e.g., KyberSwap, Uniswap V3's customizable fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. For order books, the equivalent is the spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Elixir automatically widens spreads during periods of higher volatility to protect LPs from toxic flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, making liquidity provision more inherently profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### On-chain vs. Off-chain Order Books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>
Elixir recommends building order books off-chain that settle on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. This approach, adopted by major DEXs like dYdX, Vertex, and Hyperliquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>, is crucial for speed and cost efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Cost and Frequency of Updates**: Fully on-chain order books require users (and market makers) to pay gas fees for every order update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. This forces market makers to update less frequently, leading to wider spreads and worse execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. Elixir updates orders every 0.9 seconds gaslessly on its integrated exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
*   **Manipulation**: Fully on-chain orders are susceptible to manipulation, such as spamming transactions to prevent liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: While order book state is visible on both centralized and decentralized platforms, on-chain transparency *could* reveal market makers' leverage levels, allowing others to target liquidation points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. Elixir combats this by incorporating provable randomness within its protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. This includes a fluctuating "vonita" variable (influencing balance optimization vs. P&L) and randomly dropping 1 in 5 orders to make it economically negative for bots to trade against Elixir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

### User Experience Benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>
For end-users, an on-chain CLOB offers several advantages:
*   **Custody**: Users retain custody of their assets at all times, reducing counterparty risk prevalent in centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Fairness**: Prevents exchanges from trading against their users or exploiting liquidation levels, as all code is transparently on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.
*   **Ease of Use**: With advancements like one-click trading enabled by signature-based approvals, users can trade without repeated approvals, making the experience seamless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

## Synergy with Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>

Elixir is an early and committed builder in the Monad ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The synergy stems from Monad's promise to deliver a high-[[performance_needs_in_decentralized_finance | performance]] chain capable of supporting a centralized limit order book with high throughput and low gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

Phillip highlights several reasons for Elixir's strong commitment to Monad:
*   **Technical Strength**: Monad's technology provides increased throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Native EVM Support**: This is a critical differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. Elixir's existing stack, including smart contracts, APIs, and front-end, is built for EVM compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Rebuilding and re-auditing for non-EVM chains (like Cosmos or Rust) would impose a massive burden and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   **Community**: Monad has a strong and supportive [[the_role_of_community_in_the_crypto_industry | community]], which has also contributed to Elixir's community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.
*   **Trusted Team**: The trust in Monad's team was a key factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.

Monad's ability to create a "decentralized CLOB on chain" (referring to the combined effect of Elixir on Monad) is expected to significantly improve the user experience in [[decentralized_finance_defi_advancements | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_innovation_in_decentralized_finance_defi | Challenges and Innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>

Elixir has faced typical [[challenges_and_innovation_in_decentralized_finance_defi | challenges]] for a new project creating a new primitive in the crypto space:
*   **Hiring**: Securing top-tier talent, especially Solidity engineers, is paramount but challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>.
*   **Defining the Product**: Initially, it was difficult for people to understand Elixir's unique function as a modular DPOS Network for order book liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **Branding**: Elixir transitioned from a prominently branded integration ("Supply via Elixir") to a white-label product (e.g., "Vertex Fusion") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This allows exchanges to present Elixir's functionality as their own core feature, offering a seamless experience to their end-users (e.g., a "big Supply button") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
*   **Regulation**: Operating with a US presence in New York City necessitates significant investment in ensuring regulatory compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.

## The Role of Community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>

[[the_role_of_community_in_the_crypto_industry | Community]] is vital for Elixir, serving as its "biggest asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. Despite its B2B2C focus (providing infrastructure to exchanges that then push users to Elixir's functionality), growing public perception and momentum are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. A strong community attracts future exchanges and is essential for the upcoming mainnet launch (planned for June/July), which will see a decentralized network with thousands of validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.

## Founder's Advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>

Phillip's advice for those building in the space is to "take on early stage risk" and "be ruthless in your pursuit" of a big idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. He emphasizes owning the risk and not giving up, even when facing naysayers, to bring a vision to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. Elixir itself was built for over a year before people fully understood the problem it was solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.

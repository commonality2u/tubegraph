Developing the skill of performing a handstand is an ongoing focus, with the specific aim of achieving a solid, 5-second handstand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This has always been an area of interest for [[improving_over_time | mastering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Current Progress

While the 5-second goal has not yet been fully reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, [[improving_over_time | progress]] is being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:
*   On a good day, the hold can last for 4 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   On an average day, the duration is about half a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Efforts are continuing towards achieving the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

When asked how to [[explaining_monad_to_a_child|explain Monad to a 5-year-old]], a humorous and non-literal approach is taken.

In one instance, the response to explaining [[What is Monad|Monad]] to a child involved a request for "nice ASMR water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

A direct, albeit nonsensical, answer was given in a second instance: the explanation for a 5-year-old would be "goooo Gaga" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

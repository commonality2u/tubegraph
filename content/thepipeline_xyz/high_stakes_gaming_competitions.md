**Monad Games** is presented as a high-stakes, "no holds bar competition" where five [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestants]] battle to earn "test net tokens," also known as T-Mo, or "mana" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The ultimate winner receives $5,000 to give away to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Participants are described as [[degenerate_gambling_culture | degenerate gamblers]] who "have no idea what they're getting themselves into" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The competition involves various [[game_show_challenges_and_tactics | game show challenges]] that lead to tension and difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Contestants

Prior to the competition, the five [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestants]] are introduced, each sharing their confidence level for winning. Responses ranged from "10. Very confident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> to a "50/50 chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> and "Six" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> or "6.9 out of 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Challenges

The competition features multiple rounds, each testing different aspects of the [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestants']] abilities and willingness to take risks.

### Initial Choice: Easy vs. Hard

At the outset of the challenges, [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestants]] choose between an "easy route" worth 200 mana or a "hard route" worth 1,000 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. All [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestants]] unanimously chose the hard route, stating, "We're [[degenerate_gambling_culture | degenerate gamblers]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Cookie Carving

Inspired by *Squid Games*, this challenge requires [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestants]] to carefully carve out a design from a cookie within 7 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Breaking the cookie results in immediate elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. During the challenge, participants used various strategies, including licking the cookie to thin it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Some [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestants]] were eliminated after their cookie designs broke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### John's Mystery Meat

This challenge offered an opportunity to earn 100 mana per random meat consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The potential meats included alligator, bison, yak, kangaroo, wild boar, rabbit, rattlesnake, antelope, venison, Rocky Mountain Oysters (bull balls), and chicken sausage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. All meats were confirmed safe to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | Contestants]] reacted strongly to the "bull balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a> and a "Mountain Man" blend of elk, venison, antelope, wild boar, and bison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Hot or Not (Pitch Competition)

[[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | Contestants]] pitched a random, non-existent business idea within 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. They could choose to eat a spicy item corresponding to the pitch's "heat level" for bonus mana: jelly beans (200 mana), the world's hottest chocolate (500 mana), or the One Chip Challenge (2,000 mana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Eating the spicy item was optional, but consuming yogurt to relieve the heat before the time was up would negate points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Pitches included:
*   "Only NADS": An AI-powered filter for inappropriate images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   "Work to Earn": Gamifying work tracking and rewarding time spent at a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
*   "Dog Date Concept": Tinder for dogs to find playdates or breeding partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
*   "Couch Confessional": An AI priest for deep secrets, with a crypto V2 version rewarding tokens based on the severity of confessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
*   "Fridge Cop": An AI audio coach linked to a fridge for real-time dietary feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

The winner of this round earned 1,500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

### Seed Phrase Ice Block

[[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | Contestants]] were given a block of ice containing eight numbered words, which formed a seed phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. The goal was to break open the ice and correctly order the seed phrase within 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | Contestants]] used various tools (e.g., keyboard, tongs, spoon) to break the ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. One [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestant]] bribed another for a missing word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. This round was "all or nothing" and worth 1,500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

### Split or Steal

The final game, worth 2,500 tokens, was a psychological challenge called "Split or Steal," designed to test [[trust_and_strategy_in_decisionmaking_games | trust and strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Each [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestant]] secretly chose to either "split" or "steal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>:
*   If everyone chose to split, all five [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestants]] would each receive 500 mana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   If only one person chose to steal, that person would take all the tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
*   If two or more people chose to steal, the splitters would receive everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
*   If three or more people chose to steal, no one would win anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

In the end, two [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestants]] (Pre-balling and Intern) chose "Split" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>, while Danny chose "Steal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. This outcome meant that Danny, as the sole stealer, won all 2,500 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

## Outcome

Danny, also known as "Professor Pipelines," was declared the winner of Monad Games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>, securing $5,000 to give away to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. Despite his win, Danny chose to split the prize money among three "OG Monad community members" who were also [[monad_games_stream_and_contestants | contestants]] (Pre-balling, Spam, and KB), stating his appreciation for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

One of the core motivations for entering the crypto space stems from a deep passion for [[self_sovereignty_and_financial_independence | Financial Freedom]] and financial rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These are considered crucial as they underpin nearly every other human right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The belief is that when individuals have control over their finances, they are empowered to spend their money on things they genuinely care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This contrasts with scenarios where control over money resides with entities like the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The pursuit of greater individual financial autonomy is a driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

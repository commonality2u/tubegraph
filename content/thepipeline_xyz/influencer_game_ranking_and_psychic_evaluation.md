In a segment of the Monad Games competition, contestants faced a challenge focused on social influence, culminating in a unique psychic evaluation to determine the "biggest yapper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This challenge offered participants an opportunity to earn significant tokens: 500 Monad (Ma) for correctly self-placing and 1,000 Ma for being placed in the number one spot by the psychic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Initial Self-Ranking by Influence

The first part of the challenge required the five contestants to arrange themselves in order from most influential to least influential, left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
One contestant immediately claimed the first spot due to having a "six-figure follower count" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Another noted the difficulty in ranking between "Danny versus KB" due to "pipeline" or "brand versus personal" influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. The group eventually settled on a self-ranked order, which they felt was "pretty accurate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. A contestant without a [[fantasy_top_and_its_impact_on_twitter | Fantasy Top card]] felt they were in the correct position on the "right side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## The Psychic Evaluation

Following the self-ranking, a professional psychic was brought in to provide a 5-minute reading for each contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Her task was to arrange them from least to most influential based purely on her intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. After the reading, each contestant was given 15 seconds to plead their case for why they should be considered the most influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### Psychic's Observations and Contestant Responses

The psychic offered various observations about the contestants' personalities and tendencies:
*   **Danny:** Described as a "great organizer," "a little anal," an "empath," a "dancer," wanting to "act" and "perform," and a "caregiver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. She noted he is "secretive" and prefers to be "in the back" despite being good upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Danny reflected that her comment about him not preferring to be in the spotlight was "definitely true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **General:** One contestant felt the psychic was "going heavy empath" with them, which they felt was true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Another mentioned the psychic said they were a "dancer, like showgirl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. A contestant noted her accuracy about taking a lighter from a table and pocketing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

## Outcome of the Psychic Ranking

In the end, only one contestant, KB, was placed in the number one spot by the psychic, securing the 1,000 Ma prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The psychic's final ranking placed others as "least," "second to least," and a tied "two and three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Despite the psychic's intuitive approach to [[influencer_and_creator_performance_metrics | influence]] and [[engagement_and_influence_on_social_media_platforms | social media engagement]], there were no instances where a contestant was placed in the exact same spot they had initially placed themselves in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

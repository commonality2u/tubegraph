The Monad ecosystem emphasizes [[hiring_in_monad_community | community members]] being hired natively within its framework, which is considered a key point of differentiation for the Monad community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Opportunities within the Monad Ecosystem

There are significant opportunities within the Monad ecosystem, which some believe people are still overlooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Specifically, in Eco marketing, nearly every team building on Monad is actively seeking assistance with social media, marketing, and community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Hiring Philosophy

Two key pieces of advice are provided for hiring within the ecosystem:
> [00:00:27] "One is to [[hiring_within_the_crypto_industry | hire crypto native]] but two is to hire Monad native."

This approach emphasizes the importance of candidates understanding the specific nuances of the Monad community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Real-World Example

A recent example highlights this philosophy: a need arose for someone "from the Monad side" to help manage an upcoming initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Within days, a [[hiring_in_monad_community | Monad community member]] secured a full-time job in crypto, demonstrating the "truly endless" opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This trend is seen as the "meta" for the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

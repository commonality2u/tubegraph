Backpack Exchange emerged from a desire to address the market vacuum left by FTX, leveraging Backpack's existing strengths in product, engineering, marketing, and community building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. The idea to launch an exchange arose from a serendipitous meeting between Backpack's co-founder, Armani, and a leading expert in crypto regulatory compliance and licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. This collaboration aimed to combine Backpack's robust product and community infrastructure with unparalleled regulatory expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

## Foundational Synergy: Wallet, NFTs, and Exchange

The Backpack ecosystem is built on a synergistic triangle of components: the Backpack non-custodial wallet, the Mad Lads NFT collection, and the Backpack Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
*   **Backpack Wallet** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a> serves as the on-chain user journey, supporting Solana and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. It introduced X NFTs (decentralized applications runnable in the wallet), which were a novel concept at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The wallet was used as a community engagement tool, with games and invite codes for beta testers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Mad Lads NFTs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a> were initiated as a community-building exercise and cultural backbone for the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. They also served as a showcase for X NFT technology, allowing NFTs to function as applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The minting process for Mad Lads was entirely unique, taking place within the Backpack wallet and involving a game to "unrug" the NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. This generated significant hype during a difficult crypto market period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. Mad Lads holders act as "super fans" and "super users," providing valuable feedback and testing for new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.
*   **Backpack Exchange** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a> handles the off-chain user journey, designed for seamless interaction with the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. This integrated experience allows users to easily transition between fiat deposits on the exchange and trading meme coins on-chain via the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

## Regulatory Strategy and Location

Backpack Exchange launched in November of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>, marking an international focus from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. The team proactively chose to operate outside the U.S. due to its less crypto-friendly regulatory environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

Key aspects of Backpack's regulatory approach:
*   **Regulation-First Approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>: Unlike many exchanges that start as "cowboys" and then backtrack into compliance, Backpack has been fully regulated and compliant from day zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **VARA License** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>: Backpack received the first VARA (Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority) full retail cryptocurrency exchange license from Dubai, working with the reputable regulator from the very beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. This ensures a foundation of trust and facilitates gaining new licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
*   **Strategic Location (Tokyo/Asia)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>: The team decided to base operations in Asia, considering Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. Japan was chosen due to having an existing team member working on a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange license, an established office, and a consistently web3-friendly regulatory direction throughout the bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Japan's significant GDP also makes it an attractive market for crypto trading volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.

## Exchange Architecture and Trust Building

Backpack Exchange was built from first principles, deviating from existing matching engine models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
*   **Permissioned Blockchain Model** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>: The exchange operates as a permissioned blockchain, with different validators running instances of the same exchange. This allows for replayability of transactions and potentially involves regulators or large firms running validators to eliminate single points of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   **Proof of Reserves** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>: A core infrastructure piece includes a ZK proof reserves system, enabling users to verify their funds without trusting the exchange, although this feature has not yet been fully implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>: Backpack aims to be a middle ground between the compliance-heavy approach of Coinbase and the "crypto-native, fast-moving" approach of Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. They prioritize compliance while maintaining a nimble product team to attract a user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. This approach highlights [[Building trust in the market especially in crypto | building trust]] as a core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

## Launch and Growth

The exchange's launch was accelerated by a partnership with Pyth Network for their Token Generation Event (TGE), where Backpack served as a distribution vehicle for Pyth tokens to centralized exchange users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.
*   **Viral Launch Event** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>: This launch involved giving out 10 million Pyth tokens, which went viral, especially in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. It resulted in 140,000 KYC users in the first week and 74,000 participants in the Pyth drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>.
*   **Stress Testing and Improvement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>: The intense launch activity, including 10 days of non-stop work for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>, hardened the system and exposed pain points, leading to significant improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.
*   **Trading Volume Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>: Backpack saw substantial growth, accumulating 350,000 active traders within a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. A points system launched in February generated absurd spot volume, growing from $3-7 million daily to $27.5 billion between February 13th and March 18th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. This included days with over a billion dollars in spot volume and even the largest Solana spot market globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
*   **Token Distribution as Growth Vehicle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>: Tokens from partners like Wormhole (27 million W tokens distributed to 300,000 traders) and Tensor were used as a growth vehicle, onboarding new users to the exchange and exposing them to on-chain protocols like Tensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Post-Event Plateaus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>: After initial incentive campaigns, Backpack's organic spot trading volume has plateaued higher, reaching $120-160 million daily with no announced incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>. The goal is to continue adding products like Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC-20s, and Futures to make Backpack the primary trading vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

## Driving On-Chain Adoption

Backpack actively encourages its users, many of whom are primarily centralized exchange users, to engage with the on-chain world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>. For example, a requirement for the Tensor token drop was to perform a trade on the Tensor protocol, which drove a significant number of new unique wallet addresses to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. This contrasts with many exchanges that try to keep users within their centralized environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

## Outlook

Backpack is focused on continued growth, aiming to become a mainstay international cryptocurrency exchange and one of the largest exchanges globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. This involves constant work and product development to achieve massive distribution and establish the Backpack wallet as the biggest Solana wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.

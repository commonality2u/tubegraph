The long-term vision for NFTs extends beyond digital collectibles to [[importance_of_realworld_applications_in_blockchain | real-world assets]] being recorded on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. JPEGs are considered a bridge to this future, where [[importance_of_realworld_applications_in_blockchain | real-world assets]] are digitized and managed using blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

## Current Inefficiencies in Asset Management

Existing systems for managing [[importance_of_realworld_applications_in_blockchain | real-world assets]] often suffer from poor information and lack of transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. For instance, in construction equipment auctions, buyers frequently need to physically inspect items because the available information is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. This highlights a broader issue in how tangible assets are tracked and sold. The historical record of physical assets is currently very inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.

## Blockchain as a Solution for Real-World Assets

Blockchain technology offers a powerful solution to these inefficiencies by providing a seamless and transparent way to manage [[importance_of_realworld_applications_in_blockchain | real-world assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.

### NFTs as Title or Deed
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can serve as a form of title, deed, or ownership for any physical item in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>. The unique qualities of an NFT can represent specific attributes of a unique asset on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

### Enhanced Data and Transparency
By placing asset information on-chain, every detail about a physical asset can be recorded and tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This includes:
*   Service records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>
*   Operating hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>
*   Metadata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>
*   Ownership history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>

This richer context would allow buyers to understand an asset's complete historical flow, such as whether a tractor spent its life in a mine or doing landscaping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

### Seamless Transactions
The integration of blockchain could make transactions as simple as registering for a website or authenticating with Face ID, with seamless Fiat-to-crypto conversions occurring invisibly in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. This would facilitate one-click purchases of high-value items, such as a $75,000 piece of equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.

## The Opportunity for Disruption
The market for transacting physical goods, including marketplaces like Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Craigslist, and industrial auction sites like Richie Brothers, represents trillions of dollars globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. Many companies in these spaces are valued in the billions, despite operating with inefficient information systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. This presents a massive opportunity for blockchain-based solutions to disrupt traditional industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook
Despite the potential, the [[challenges_and_innovations_in_blockchain_development | app layer]] in crypto is currently "failing miserably" at building solutions for [[importance_of_realworld_applications_in_blockchain | real-world applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. Many crypto products remain isolated within the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Call to Action
> People should be building products that use crypto technology and infrastructure for a [[importance_of_realworld_applications_in_blockchain | real-world industry]], rather than exclusively within the crypto industry itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. Focusing on less-regulated marketplaces first could be a strategic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.

This shift would require long-term vision and significant fortitude, as the timeline for such disruptive innovation is typically a decade or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>. The focus should be on creating sustainable business models and gaining users in the real world, rather than solely relying on token liquidation or short-term speculative trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.

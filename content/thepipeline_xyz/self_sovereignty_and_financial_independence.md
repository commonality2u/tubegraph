Crypto aims to solve real-world problems, with a focus on empowering users through self-sovereignty and financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Core Tenets: Self-Sovereignty and Permissionless Access

Early engagement with crypto, particularly from 2013 onwards, was driven by a strong libertarian viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This perspective held that traditional banks were irresponsible with money and the state of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The concept of self-sovereignty was seen as a powerful tool, emphasizing the ability to have full control over one's money, pay anyone as desired, and interact permissionlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This thesis, that the space matters for permissionless access and self-sovereignty, remains a foundational principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Crypto seeks to disrupt traditional money, banking, and the financial industry, which is considered a significant enough problem to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The evolution of technology, including programmable smart contracts, has enabled the creation of more interesting financial primitives and structures that can be broadly useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In doing so, crypto unlocks numerous other empowering possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Real-World Applications and Disruptions

### Payments
Payments are a key area where crypto offers clear advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. In the Western world, credit card companies charge substantial fees—around 3% of every transaction—which imposes a significant cost on businesses, both small and large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This market, represented by the combined market caps of Visa and Mastercard, is a trillion-dollar business that extracts a large sum primarily from small and medium businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Crypto provides a way for individuals to pay for services using their phone, bypassing these middlemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. In parts of the world where credit cards are less common, crypto, especially Tether, is already widely used for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. For crypto to fully disrupt payments, networks need to achieve transaction scales comparable to current payment processing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Monad aims to be such a network, capable of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### [[decentralized_finance_and_personal_finance | Personal Finance]]
[[decentralized_finance_and_personal_finance | Personal finance]] is another area where crypto can deliver substantial value to end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The goal is to make Decentralized Finance (DeFi) the standard for activities like banking, trading, borrowing, and lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. For this to happen, crypto systems must offer an experience equal to or better than centralized personal finance tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This requires:
*   **Reduced slippage:** Moving from frequent 1-5% slippage in DeFi to single-digit basis points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Improved execution costs:** Making the cost of on-chain trading comparable to or better than centralized environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
These improvements necessitate a highly performant environment that allows market makers to quote tightly and compete effectively, leading to a much better execution experience for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Broader Settlement
Beyond payments and personal finance, crypto holds potential for broader settlement processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This includes settlement for stock trading and the transfer of assets like houses or cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

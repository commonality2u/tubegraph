[[user_security_in_cryptocurrency | User security in cryptocurrency]] involves understanding common targets for [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | attackers]] and implementing a proactive strategy to mitigate risks. [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | Attackers]] typically focus on three core areas: funds, access, and [[data_privacy_and_crypto | data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Common Attacker Targets

### Funds
[[importance_of_securing_funds_and_accounts | Funds]] include any assets stored on-chain, centralized exchanges (CEXes), or in wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Access
[[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | Access]] refers to the ability for an attacker to use your account as an interception point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This could be to target individuals around you, such as colleagues, friends, or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. For example, if a public figure's account is compromised, [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | attackers]] could leverage that [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | access]] in a [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | spear fishing campaign]] to gain [[risks_of_unauthorized_access_and_social_engineering | access]] to others' accounts, perhaps by sending malicious meeting invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Data
The third target is your [[data_privacy_and_crypto | data]], specifically [[data_privacy_and_crypto | sensitive credentials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Wherever these are stored, their security must be rigorously audited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Proactive Security Strategy

A strong approach to security involves identifying all potential points of failure in your digital life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This includes:

*   **Inventorying Assets:** Cataloging all your accounts, devices, and digital touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Creating a map of all potential points of concern or vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Mitigation:** Continuously tweaking and mitigating identified issues as they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Crypto wallets are broadly categorized into "hot" and "cold" wallets, primarily based on their connection to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This fundamental difference impacts their [[security_of_cold_wallets | security]], [[convenience_and_risks_of_hot_wallets | convenience]], and intended use.

## Cold Wallets

A [[hot_wallets_vs_cold_wallets | cold wallet]] stores funds with private keys kept offline, meaning they are not connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This method is often referred to as "cold storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Security
*   **Offline Nature**: Because cold wallets are offline, hackers cannot gain access to them unless specific user mistakes are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **High Security**: They are considered far more secure than hot wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Lower Compromise Risk**: Cold wallets are significantly less likely to be compromised compared to hot wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Usability and Risks
*   **Extra Steps**: While more secure, cold wallets require additional steps for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Despite the inconvenience, these extra steps are considered "very much worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Physical Risks**: There is a risk of physically losing or misplacing the cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Transaction Friction**: The offline nature creates a "friction" when moving funds quickly, which differs from the seamless experience of hot wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### [[best_practices_for_wallet_security | Best Practices]] for Cold Wallets
*   **Backup Recovery Phrase**: Always back up your recovery phrase or keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Keep Offline**: Never put your recovery phrase or keys online, as this completely negates the [[security_of_cold_wallets | security]] purpose of a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Secure Physical Storage**: Store them in a safe place, ideally written on a piece of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Fireproof Storage**: Consider storing them in a fireproof location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Known Location**: Ensure you know exactly where your recovery phrase is stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Hot Wallets

A [[hot_wallets_vs_cold_wallets | hot wallet]] is "hot" because it is live and continuously connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Convenience and Risks
*   **Ease of Use**: A significant advantage of hot wallets is their user-friendliness and ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Speed for Traders**: They are frequently used by traders to quickly move funds on-chain and off-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Higher Compromise Risk**: Due to their online nature, hot wallets are much more likely to be compromised than cold wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Fund Limitation**: It is advisable not to keep too many funds in a hot wallet due to the increased risk of compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

> [!tip] Security Advice
> It is recommended to do all your trading using cold wallets for enhanced [[security_of_cold_wallets | security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For hot wallets, never keep too much in them due to the higher risk of compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

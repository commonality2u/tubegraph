## The Genesis of Monad: Bridging High-Frequency Trading with Blockchain

The inspiration for Monad, a new blockchain initiative, stems from a rich background in [[Challenges and advancements in highfrequency trading and blockchain | high-frequency trading]] (HFT) and a subsequent deep dive into the world of [[Crypto and blockchain influences | cryptocurrency]] and [[Technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | blockchain technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The founders, James and another individual, first collaborated in 2014 on a [[Challenges and advancements in highfrequency trading and blockchain | high-frequency trading]] team at Jump Trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Insights from High-Frequency Trading

In the HFT environment, the primary objective is to construct a complete trading system from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This involves ingesting large volumes of data packets from exchanges, making extremely rapid trading decisions, and then dispatching orders back to the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It is a highly competitive domain where speed is paramount; the party able to decide and send an order faster gains the advantage, whether by taking liquidity for an aggressive order or securing a position in the queue for a passive order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This intensely latency-competitive environment spurred continuous system improvements, leading to significant reductions in latency and the development of highly performant systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Transition to Crypto and Identified Needs

By 2021, the team transitioned to Jump's [[Crypto and blockchain influences | crypto]] division, focusing immediately on [[Realworld applications of blockchain technology and NFTs | DeFi projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Specifically, James contributed to Pith, concentrating on Solana [[Realworld applications of blockchain technology and NFTs | DeFi]] for approximately six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Through this experience, a critical need became apparent: a demand for more performant [[Technology advancements and infrastructure in blockchain | blockchain]] solutions generally, and a particularly urgent need for a more performant Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

It was observed that existing EVM implementations were notably inefficient and lacked the level of optimization previously applied to HFT systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The team recognized that their background in building highly performant systems from the ground up made them uniquely suited to address these [[challenges and propositions in blockchain technology | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### The Foundation for Monad

The initial inspiration for Monad is thus a blend of two key experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>:
*   The experience of developing highly performant systems from scratch for different applications, such as [[Challenges and advancements in highfrequency trading and blockchain | high-frequency trading]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Direct interaction with both Solana and Ethereum, which highlighted performance disparities and significant optimization opportunities within the EVM space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

While Solana had undergone many optimizations, the EVM realm presented a vast landscape for improvements, which became the driving force behind Monad's inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

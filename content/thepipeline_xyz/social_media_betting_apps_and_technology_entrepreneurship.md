Kizzy is introduced as the world's first [[social_media_betting | social media betting app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The developer describes it as a platform where users "flip this" to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This venture represents a key focus for the entrepreneur.

## The Entrepreneurial Journey

The individual behind Kizzy expresses deep gratitude for the opportunity to work on something they are "extremely passionate about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This passion leads them to wake up excited every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, a stark contrast to a previous job from three or four years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Collaborative Work Style

A significant self-realization for the entrepreneur is their inability to work alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As a triplet, they have always had people around them since birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This innate preference for collaboration extends to their professional life, as they enjoy doing things with other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. They acknowledge not possessing all the necessary skills to handle everything independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

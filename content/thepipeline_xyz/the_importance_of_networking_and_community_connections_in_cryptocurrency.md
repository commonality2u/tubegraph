The cryptocurrency space, while often technical, thrives on human connection, networking, and community engagement. This is evident in the organic growth of projects, the value placed on transparency, and the strategic approach to building relationships within the industry.

## Staying "Tapped In" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:15">[09:54:15]</a>
To remain updated and relevant in the fast-paced crypto world, being "tapped in" to key conversations and emerging trends is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:15">[09:54:15]</a>. This often involves being part of tight-knit, private groups of experienced individuals who share insights and discuss new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:44:39">[37:44:39]</a>. These informal networks can provide early information and perspectives on developing trends, such as the initial mentions of Monad before it gained significant public attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:01">[38:05:01]</a>.

## Transparency and Trust in Projects
The human element and transparency are vital for long-term project success and [[the_role_of_community_in_the_crypto_industry | community trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:34:00">[38:34:00]</a>.
In the crypto space, projects shrouded in mystery with anonymous founders can lead to distrust, especially given past instances of unfulfilled roadmaps and "rug pulls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>. This issue is particularly prevalent in meme coins, where founders might hide their identities only to take substantial profits in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>.

In contrast, projects with publicly known leaders, like Keone Hon of Monad, who actively engage with the community and host events, foster a sense of trust and legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:00">[39:27:00]</a>. This openness was a significant factor in attracting early supporters to the Monad community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>.

## The "Influencer Chain" Argument
The involvement of influential figures in a project can sometimes be misconstrued as mere "influencer pumping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>. However, it can also signify that experienced individuals who have dedicated time to the space are confidently backing a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:42:00">[46:42:00]</a>.

The most engaged and perennially online individuals in crypto are often those with large followings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:55:00">[46:55:00]</a>. Their bullish sentiment towards a project, particularly when they make career changes to join a team, indicates a deep belief rather than just a fleeting interest or token allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:16:00">[47:16:00]</a>. Therefore, the involvement of such figures can be seen as an indicator to pay closer attention to a project, rather than to shy away from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>.

## Approaching Influencers and Networking Effectively
When seeking to connect with influencers or key figures in the crypto space, a strategic mindset is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>.

Instead of asking for something, the advice is to **offer something** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:15:00">[51:15:00]</a>. This shifts the dynamic from an extractive to an offering mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:00">[51:42:00]</a>. Simply offering a whitelist spot for an NFT project might not be enough if it doesn't provide genuine value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:25:00">[51:25:00]</a>.

Genuine contributions, such as creating valuable content like threads or newsletters, or even engaging in community activities like hosting quizzes, can build positive relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:10:00">[52:10:00]</a>. When individuals offer value and contribute to the community, others are more likely to seek them out and engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:30:00">[52:30:00]</a>. This approach fosters [[role_of_community_and_collaboration_in_crypto_projects | collaboration]] and makes interactions more fruitful, as these individuals are often creators themselves and open to genuine engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:28:00">[53:28:00]</a>.

For instance, the podcast "The Pipeline" has successfully attracted an S-tier roster of guests by simply approaching people with an offer to come on the show, demonstrating the power of a collaborative and inviting attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_community_and_engagement_in_crypto_projects | importance of community and engagement in crypto projects]].

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:00">[50:01:00]</a>
> [!NOTE] Final Alpha: Offer, Don't Ask
> "If you're wanting to in some capacity approach an influencer, if you've got a project, what don't ask them for something, offer them something would be my advice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:10:00">[51:10:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the crypto space, including its art and meme culture, thrives on shared experiences and collective understanding. Artists like Bold, who create timely and humorous commentary on crypto culture, resonate because they are "drawing" from a shared, dynamic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. The ability to connect with the pulse of the community and contribute meaningfully is a cornerstone of success and growth in this decentralized, yet highly interconnected, industry.

This approach emphasizes organic growth and leveraging diverse talents from within the community to create engaging content and foster a unique ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Community-Driven Content
The foundation of [[growth_and_development_of_the_monad_community | Monad's community growth]] stems from organic contributions. Early initiatives, such as Danny's win in the first meme competition in Telegram, led to the development of Twitter Spaces and the realization that community talent should not "go to waste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Rachel Mario and Saddam are also recognized for their artistic contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Monad Community Platforms
The [[understanding_monad_and_its_community | Monad community]] has grown through various platforms, each contributing to its unique character.

### Discord
Initially, the Monad Discord started as an "invite-only" platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. The opening of the Discord to the public marked Intern Bra's first interaction with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. The Discord's early days were characterized by infrequent but high-quality content, with values and mission remaining consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

### Telegram
The Telegram chat, established around December 2022, was initially open to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. It later became private and capped at 1,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This transition led to the rise of meme competitions and the "Purge" system, where less active members were removed to make space for new ones, fostering a core group of committed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. The Telegram chat has accumulated over 2 million messages, primarily consisting of stickers and links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

### Multi-Vertical Approach
Monad fosters diverse "verticals" within its community, including Discord, Telegram, and Twitter, allowing members to contribute in various ways based on their strengths and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This parallels the future on-chain verticals expected on Monad, such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and social applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

## Future Applications on Monad
The community is excited about the potential applications on Monad once it goes live:
*   **DeFi and Trading**: The high TPS (Transactions Per Second) of Monad, notably 10,000 TPS, excites users about faster liquidations and improved trading experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. A key differentiator is the potential for Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs) to exist fully on-chain, enabling deeper liquidity and better execution for traders due to lower gas fees and high TPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.
*   **Gaming**: Gaming on Monad is anticipated to combine frictionless user experience with the strong community aspect, allowing for on-chain interactions like trading NFTs and grinding levels with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Community initiatives like the "obab game initiative" in Discord have already shown the potential for engaging on-chain games like poker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
*   **Financialization of Fun**: The concept of "financialization of fun" suggests that off-chain activities like co-creation and identity-maxing will translate to on-chain experiences, including social events, games, NFTs representing lore, and meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

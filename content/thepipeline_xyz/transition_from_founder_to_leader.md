For [[early_stage_founders | early stage founders]], the concept of leadership is often initially "out of question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The primary job of a founder is to handle "literally everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This includes coding, selling, cleaning, and dealing with legal and accounting matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. All initial tasks must be executed by the founders themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The "Great Soldier" Philosophy

The path to effective leadership for founders is counterintuitive, emphasizing the [[importance_of_being_a_great_soldier_before_a_leader | role of a "great soldier"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
*   Greatest founders who eventually became leaders first excelled as "great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   Founders should aim to "fight a lot of battles on ground" themselves before hiring others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This hands-on experience enables them to effectively hire "great soldiers" later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

> "Be a great Soldier become such a great soldier that you can fight a lot of battles on ground before you hire soldiers that's when you know how to hire great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

## The Transition Period

After gaining experience as a "soldier," there will be a "transition period" where the founder can "become a leader or grow into the [[role_of_leadership_in_startups | role of a leader]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While there is significant support available for developing into a leader, there is notably less support for individuals aiming to become "great soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of practical experience for leadership, stating that "a great warrior would become a great leader but a great leader who's never been on the ground fighting those battles not very great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The goal is to cultivate "greatest of soldiers" who will then naturally evolve into effective leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Pulse is a cutting-edge team developing a consumer-facing product that combines both software and hardware in the realm of wearable technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The company aims to help individuals optimize their productivity and overall well-being by providing actionable insights from their personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Inspiration and Vision
Nix, the founder of Pulse, spent a significant portion of his 20s and 30s prioritizing building startups over his personal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This led to a realization that his body was not responding as it used to, prompting a shift in focus towards health and longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. He recognized that unlike financial assets, one's body cannot be traded or easily replaced, emphasizing the importance of aging gracefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The core vision behind Pulse is the belief that taking care of one's body can directly lead to increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Pulse is designed as a "lifestyle wearable," not just a health wearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. It aims to help users become better operators, builders, or simply better humans in the ways they aspire to be, through insights derived from their health data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Web3 Integration and Data Ownership
A key differentiator for Pulse is its integration of Web3 components, addressing limitations observed in traditional wearables like Whoop and Aura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Nix noted that users of conventional wearables are often not rewarded for the valuable data they generate, which is frequently sold to third-party companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Pulse leverages [[Monad Labs Technology and Innovations | crypto rails]] as a transparency mechanism for data brokerage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This allows users to be notified and decide whether to license their data to interested third parties, such as research entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The system ensures transparency regarding what data is shared, for how long, and for what purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This approach directly addresses concerns around [[Data privacy and rewards in wearable tech | data privacy and rewards in wearable tech]] and [[Healthcare and Data Sovereignty | data sovereignty]] by giving users control and compensation for their personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

Furthermore, Pulse aims to store as much data as possible encrypted on-chain, using technologies like MPC-powered encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. This means only the user can decrypt their data, providing confidence against hacks and unauthorized access, similar to Apple's use of homomorphic encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

## Hardware Development Challenges
Building hardware is significantly more challenging than software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. A single mistake in hardware can require rebuilding from scratch, unlike software where updates can be shipped quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The Pulse team dedicated an entire summer to what Nix described as "the gauntlet of production" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This involved:
*   Finding and benchmarking suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>
*   Developing designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>
*   Figuring out logistics, fulfillment, and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
*   Customizing branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>

One of Pulse's co-founders relocated to China for an extended period to oversee production, demonstrating the team's commitment to the hardware aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

The decision to build proprietary hardware offers several strategic advantages:
1.  **Creating a Moat**: It prevents other teams like Whoop or Oura from displacing Pulse by restricting API access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
2.  **NFC Chip Integration**: The wearable includes an NFC chip for direct crypto wallet integration, enabling "proof of pulse" to verify that one wallet equals one human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This has significant value for teams needing to verify real human users without doxing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This could be a building block for [[Social Fi trends and applications | social fi trends]].
3.  **API and SDK for Developers**: Pulse plans to offer its API and SDK to other teams, allowing them to build software on top of the wearable device. This positions the wearable as a piece of physical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Differentiating in the Market
Pulse has studied existing wearable markets, including Whoop, Aura, UltraHuman Ring, Fitbit, and Apple Watch, to understand what works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Nix observed that many Whoop users, particularly in tech, are primarily interested in sleep tracking for productivity, even though Whoop is optimized for athletes and strain/recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Pulse's differentiation lies in its focus on "productivity" and a broader "lifestyle" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. It considers various factors influencing productivity, such as sleep, exercise, diet, stress levels, sun exposure, socializing, and overall fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This broader scope distinguishes Pulse from traditional health and fitness trackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Growth and Community Strategy
The initial goal for Pulse is to build a hardcore fan base of 10,000 users, primarily within the [[emerging consumer apps leveraging blockchain technology | crypto community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This phase aims to refine the app, positioning, and branding, proving the product's stickiness and value for lifestyle productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

Following this, the focus will shift to the "Normy Market" (mainstream retail), involving marketing on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. The messaging will target specific demographics, such as busy moms seeking more energy, students wanting to study longer, or high-performers aiming to wake up earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This will involve various marketing strategies, including influencer marketing, paid advertising, and performance-based marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Once Pulse reaches a healthy distribution level (e.g., 100,000 daily active users), the team plans to pursue data acquisition deals with companies interested in licensing aggregate, anonymized user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

### Crypto's Advantage in Community Building
Nix highlights that crypto is powerful for formulating culture and community, especially around beliefs like privacy and self-sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. Through token ownership and data ownership, crypto helps build communities that traditional companies like Whoop or Aura cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This community-driven approach is seen as a massive advantage for growth and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

## Health Optimization Tips
Nix shared some low-hanging fruit tips for health optimization:
*   **Blackout Curtains**: These help regulate sleep cycles more efficiently, preventing early morning light from disrupting sleep, especially in regions with early sunrises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Regular Exercise**: Emphasized that exercise is often overlooked compared to diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. Even short runs can significantly improve mood, focus, creativity, and resilience as a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   **Enjoyable Exercise**: The rise of activities like pickleball, Orange Theory, spin classes, and hot yoga shows people are finding creative ways to incorporate exercise they enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

## Activity Detection
Pulse uses various sensors to glean insights from a device on the user's wrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>:
*   **Accelerometer**: Detects acceleration and deceleration to infer physical activities like lifting weights or running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
*   **Temperature Sensors**: Helps determine if a user is outdoors or indoors (e.g., in a hot yoga class) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
*   **Heart Rate**: Provides consistent data points during activities like running, where heart rate typically elevates and stays consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

Pulse aims to auto-detect about 50 common health and fitness activities, including swimming, boxing, yoga, and Pilates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Beyond activities, Pulse also monitors general lifestyle data, such as prolonged sitting or phone usage, to nudge users towards more energetic or productive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

Pulse is not about rewarding users for being healthier, but for the value generated by sharing their day-to-day lifestyle data with third parties interested in building products, new drugs, or developing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. The vision extends to incentivizing users to contribute additional data like blood work, DNA, and electronic health records to build a more comprehensive "Health digital twin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

## Why Build on Monad?
Pulse chose to build on [[Monad Labs and Ecosystem | Monad]] after an initial inclination towards Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. The decision came after extensive research into [[Monad Labs Technology and Innovations | Monad's consensus mechanism]] and throughput capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. Key factors for choosing Monad included:
*   **Infrastructure**: Monad's infrastructure meets Pulse's needs, particularly for speed and low latency, which are crucial for user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. As a non-DeFi app, Pulse prioritizes user experience over TVL or liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
*   **Community**: Monad's community is already "pilled" on the value of [[consumer_crypto_trends_and_developments | consumer crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. This means Pulse doesn't have to convince users of its value proposition, as the community already understands and supports the concept of self-optimization and health, evident in community groups like "iron nads," "Monad Run Club," and "Monad Gym Club" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

## Final Alpha
Nix's advice for builders, drawing from Ben Horowitz's book *The Hard Thing About Hard Things*:
> "If you're going to eat shit, don't nibble." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>
This quote emphasizes that when faced with difficult situations, it's better to address them fully and decisively rather than prolonging the agony with half-measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

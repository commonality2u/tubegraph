Often, what presents as an objection to starting something new, such as "I don't have the time," is actually a "100% an excuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These [[overcoming_excuses | excuses]] often stem from fear or not knowing where to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Embracing Discomfort

Feeling uncomfortable, for instance, when [[getting_comfortable_on_camera | talking to a camera]], is a common experience, even for those who do it often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The key is to acknowledge this discomfort as a part of life and to start doing the task anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Power of Starting

Improvement comes with consistent action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Even if initial attempts are "terrible," persistence leads to getting better and developing a comfortable method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Your individual process for overcoming discomfort and achieving comfort will emerge through repeated practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

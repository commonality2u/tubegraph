Attackers typically target three core areas: funds, access, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Primary Targets of Attackers

### Funds
This refers to whatever assets are stored on-chain, on centralized exchanges (CEXs), or in digital wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Access
Attackers seek [[access_vulnerabilities | access]] to use an individual as an interception point to others, including colleagues, friends, or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. For example, if a public figure's account is compromised, attackers could leverage that [[access_vulnerabilities | access]] in a spear-fishing campaign to target someone else, such as by sending a malicious meeting invite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Data
This refers to sensitive credentials, which must be rigorously audited wherever they are stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Protecting [[data_security | data]] is essential for overall security.

## Identifying and Mitigating Risks
It is crucial to have a strong understanding of all potential "points of failure" in one's digital life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This involves:
*   **Inventorying Points of Failure** Starting an inventory of all potential vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Creating an Attack Surface Map** Developing a map that outlines all points of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once identified, it is necessary to continuously tweak and mitigate these concerns as they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

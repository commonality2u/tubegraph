Large-scale cryptocurrency hacks represent significant security breaches within the blockchain ecosystem, often resulting in substantial financial losses. One notable instance is the attack on the Ronin blockchain.

## The Ronin Bridge Hack

The Ronin blockchain, developed by the company Sky Mavis, was associated with the popular game Axie Infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:00]</a>. This incident is considered potentially the largest hack in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, resulting in approximately half a billion dollars in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The attack unfolded as follows:
*   **Initial Compromise** A devops engineer at Sky Mavis was "phished" with a job offer, which is a [[common_attack_vectors_in_the_crypto_space|common attack vector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The engineer clicked an executable file, which compromised their device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Multi-signature Vulnerability** The compromised device gained access to four keys for a multi-signature (multi-sig) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A multi-sig system requires multiple keys to unlock a transaction, similar to a door needing many keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In this case, five out of nine keys were needed to unlock the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Through social engineering, the attackers acquired four keys from the initial compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Lateral Movement and Exploitation** The attackers then performed "lateral movement," transitioning from the initially compromised device to another to obtain a fifth key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. With all five necessary keys, they were able to compromise the system and exploit its TBL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The entire breach stemmed from a single office email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

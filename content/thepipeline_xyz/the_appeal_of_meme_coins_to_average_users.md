Average crypto users often view new token launches with skepticism, believing them to be "scams" or "insider driven stories" where "the rich get richer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These users frequently feel excluded from opportunities, lacking the chance "to be early to that opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This fosters "resentment and momentum" among crypto users against the typical dynamics of new coin creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

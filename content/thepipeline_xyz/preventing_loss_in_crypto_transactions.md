Losing funds in cryptocurrency transactions is a significant concern for users. One prevalent method of attack is known as "address poisoning attacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, which highlights the [[Importance of User Security in Crypto | importance of user security in crypto]].

## Understanding Address Poisoning Attacks

Address poisoning attacks are a type of [[Crypto transaction security | crypto transaction security]] threat where an attacker monitors a user's transaction ledger (e.g., Etherscan) for incoming transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The attacker then immediately sends a small transaction to the user, but with an address that looks very similar to an address the user commonly interacts with, such as their own wallet or a frequently used recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

The attacker's address is crafted to closely match the first and last characters of the legitimate address, often exploiting how some interfaces might abbreviate or obscure the middle characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. For example, if a user's address starts with "0x11" and ends in "563FD," the attacker might create an address with identical starting and ending characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

If a user isn't paying close attention, they might mistakenly copy the attacker's fraudulent address from their transaction history, believing it to be a legitimate one they've used before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This can lead to accidentally sending a large amount of money to the attacker's address, which has resulted in significant financial losses for many individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## [[Steps for Enhancing Personal Security in Crypto | Preventing Loss in Crypto Transactions]]

To mitigate the risk of address poisoning and similar attacks, several [[Steps for Enhancing Personal Security in Crypto | steps for enhancing personal security in crypto]] should be followed:

> [!tip] Be Aware
> Always be aware of the potential for address poisoning attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

> [!tip] Use Direct Sources
> When copying and pasting cryptocurrency addresses, always use the direct source from where the address originates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

> [!tip] Verify Thoroughly
> If an address is from your own wallet or a known recipient, meticulously verify that it is the *exact* address you intend to send to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This means checking the entire address, not just the beginning and end.

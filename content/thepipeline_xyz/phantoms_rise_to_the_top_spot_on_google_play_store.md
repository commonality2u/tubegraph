Phantom recently achieved the milestone of becoming the number one finance app on the US Google Play Store, surpassing major applications like Cash App and PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:54">[09:49:54]</a>. As of the recording, Phantom was also climbing the overall Google Play rankings, reaching number six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:05">[10:35:05]</a>.

## Team Reaction and Responsibility

Brandon Milman, CEO and co-founder at Phantom, expressed surprise and pride for the team's achievement, acknowledging it as a huge milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:10">[10:14:10]</a>. He also highlighted a strong sense of responsibility that comes with being a "flag bearer for crypto at the top of the charts," serving as the first entry point for mainstream users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:46">[11:05:46]</a>. The team is ready for the challenge to "level things up" in terms of user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:02">[11:40:02]</a>.

Brian Freel, Head of Ecosystem Success at Phantom, noted that regardless of how users are entering crypto, Phantom's role as a wallet is to ensure their retention by showcasing the best of the ecosystem and getting users to interact with dApps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:02">[13:31:02]</a>.

## User Experience and Onboarding

Phantom's rise is attributed to its "great user interface and user experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:40">[13:21:40]</a>. Many new crypto users are onboarded by simply being told to download the Phantom wallet from the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:06">[13:45:06]</a>. Phantom views its role as the "front end for crypto," refining the best use cases emerging from the open, permissionless crypto arena for the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:57">[19:53:57]</a>.

The company focuses on a holistic user journey, encompassing user education, customer education, and customer support, beyond just the in-wallet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:04">[14:40:04]</a>. The increasing scalability of underlying blockchain technology means that the wallet's UX will become even more crucial for navigating and discovering the proliferation of tokens, NFTs, and dApps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:14">[15:19:14]</a>.

## Strategic Vision and Multi-Chain Future

Phantom's goal from the beginning was to become a multi-chain wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:19:07">[37:19:07]</a>. This premeditated strategy involved first establishing a strong presence in a new ecosystem, like Solana, before expanding more broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:04:15">[39:04:15]</a>. This approach allowed them to become a "flag bearer for Solana" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:23">[39:53:23]</a>, which later contributed to their overall growth and multi-chain expansion.

[[phantoms_support_for_monad_from_day_one | Phantom's support for Monad from day one]] is a significant part of this strategy, driven by Monad's technological approach, particularly its innovations in consensus and parallel execution, and its EVM compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:29">[03:28:29]</a>. This allows Phantom to offer its users the fast and cheap transactions they desire, while also bridging to the robust existing EVM ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:08">[04:04:08]</a>. The decision to support Monad aligns with Phantom's belief that a multi-chain world will likely consist of only two to five dominant ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:26">[02:30:26]</a>.

## Bridging and Future Integrations

Phantom views bridging as a fundamental cornerstone for ecosystems, facilitating the movement of liquidity across different blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:29:21">[32:29:21]</a>. They have integrated generalized bridges into their swapping experience for fungible tokens and have experience with NFT bridging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:44">[33:02:44]</a>. The acquisition of Bitsky, a creator of embedded wallets, aims to simplify onboarding by making Phantom's experience as easy as familiar Web2 identifiers, allowing users to sign up seamlessly without leaving a dApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:20">[35:36:20]</a>. This aligns with [[phantoms_strategy_and_product_development | Phantoms strategy and product development]] to increase the chances of growing crypto adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:46">[16:57:46]</a>.

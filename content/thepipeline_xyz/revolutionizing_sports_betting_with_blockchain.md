Lever.BET is a platform aiming to amplify sports betting with leverage, introducing a new wave of verifiable credit in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>. The company identifies a significant need for innovation in the sports betting sector, particularly within Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>.

## Current Problems in Sports Betting
Traditional and existing crypto-based sports betting platforms face several issues:
*   **Lack of Transparency** The most popular products often function as opaque crypto payment rails on top of standardized casino SDKs, which can be malicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:51">[02:26:51]</a>.
*   **Low Liquidity** It is often impossible to place large bets, such as a $10,000 bet, due to insufficient liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:04">[02:27:04]</a>.
*   **Lack of User Participation** There are limited options for users who wish to participate without directly engaging in betting or casino activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:15">[02:27:15]</a>.
*   **Severe Lack of Innovation** Many current Web3 solutions are merely "copy and paste" versions of Web2 casinos, lacking genuine innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:25">[02:27:25]</a>.

## Lever.BET's Solutions
Lever.BET addresses these challenges by offering:
*   **Full Transparency** All operations, including liquidations and odds, are entirely on-chain, preventing manipulation of payouts or bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:41">[02:27:41]</a>.
*   **Passive Earnings** Users can participate and earn passively without directly placing bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:58">[02:27:58]</a>.
*   **Pooled Liquidity** Adopting models similar to GMX or HMX, the platform aims to provide massive liquidity for sports betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:08">[02:28:08]</a>.
*   **Leverage Flywheels** The system functions on leverage flywheels, enabling superior odds, payouts, and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:22">[02:28:22]</a>. This represents a "true zero to one innovation" for the sports betting space, both in Web3 and generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>.
*   **Superior Odds**: By making money on the borrow rate instead of lines (vig), Lever.BET can remove the "Vig" from incoming lines, offering superior odds compared to other sportsbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:09">[02:36:09]</a>.

## Market Opportunity and Target Audience
The market for decentralized gambling (GambleFi) is substantial, with over 100,000 unique wallet addresses interacting with it on EVM chains in the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>. These users frequently move between products due to a lack of sticky innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:55">[02:28:55]</a>.

The global sports betting market is valued at over $300 billion, generating over $100 billion in regulated revenue annually, with more than twice that in the illicit market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:25">[02:29:25]</a>. Lever.BET aims to be the sole market participant to capture this market at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:46">[02:29:46]</a>.

The initial target audience is Web3 sports bettors on Monad, leveraging its technological advantages for a smooth product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:04">[02:30:04]</a>. The strategy includes:
1.  Building community during the initial beta test on Monad testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>.
2.  Transitioning to cash bets on mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:14">[02:30:14]</a>.
3.  Abstracting blockchain components to provide a clean UI/UX and payment rails, targeting a retail-focused Web2 audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>.
4.  Attacking traditional sportsbooks and casinos through partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:29">[02:30:29]</a>.

## How it Works
Users can choose a bet type, place leverage and collateral value, monitor positions live during the game, and either win or lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:41">[02:30:41]</a>. For those not wanting to bet, liquidity can be added to earn profit with minimal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### Leverage and Liquidation Mechanism
Leverage is managed by tokenizing the bet. For example, a 5x leverage on a 50-cent token means 10 cents backs the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:41">[02:33:41]</a>. Live odds are monitored, and if the theoretical collateral drops below a certain point (e.g., 40 cents), the position is liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:51">[02:33:51]</a>. Liquidation checks prevent bad debt by taking the underlying collateral and removing the ability for users to sell the tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:30">[02:34:30]</a>. Odds are aggregated from top casinos, similar to how GMX aggregates prices from exchanges like Bybit, OKX, and Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:54">[02:34:54]</a>.

### Liquidity Provision
Lever.BET aims to offer one of the most profitable stablecoin vaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>. Users deposit USDT into the vault to back leveraged positions, receiving 50% of all profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:24">[02:37:24]</a>. This model is akin to a GLP vault for GMX, offering minimal downside risk for liquidity providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:34">[02:37:34]</a>. A caveat is a minimum lock-up period (around 3 weeks) to spread risk and protect other vault users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:41">[02:37:41]</a>.

## Traction and Future Roadmap
Lever.BET has a fully functional MVP offering leverage, ready to deploy on Monad testnet upon its launch, and then mainnet for cash bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:15">[02:31:15]</a>. After establishing TVL and order book activity on mainnet, expansion across Web3 will occur via LayerZero relays, funneling users back to Monad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:47">[02:31:47]</a>. The final step involves abstracting blockchain components to target the retail market with a fully functional product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:55">[02:31:55]</a>.

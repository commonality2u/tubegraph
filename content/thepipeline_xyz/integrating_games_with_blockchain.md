Integrating blockchain technology into gaming presents unique opportunities and challenges. The primary focus for successful integration should be on the game itself, rather than the blockchain components initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Development Philosophy

Creating a compelling game is considered more difficult than creating an on-chain game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The main bottleneck for the success of blockchain-integrated games is the creation of a genuinely fun game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It is advised that developers first focus on building an enjoyable game, and *then* integrate blockchain components, such as [[the_role_of_nfts_and_asset_ownership_in_gaming | asset tracking]] or [[role_of_nfts_in_gaming | NFTs]], into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. An example cited is Roblox; the platform was developed first, and then the concept of integrating [[role_of_nfts_in_gaming | NFTs]] with it was considered to make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Addressing Existing Grey Markets

The gaming industry already features active grey markets for digital assets, such as players trading CS:GO skins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Additionally, the RuneScape grey market for gold has been operational for over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Users in these existing markets often face high risks of being scammed and typically rely on insecure methods like wire transfers to anonymous individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The current methods used for these transactions are significantly less secure than those offered by crypto technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This highlights a [[challenges_and_innovations_in_web3_gaming | challenge]] that blockchain could address by providing a more secure and transparent system for [[the_role_of_nfts_and_asset_ownership_in_gaming | asset ownership]] and trading within games.

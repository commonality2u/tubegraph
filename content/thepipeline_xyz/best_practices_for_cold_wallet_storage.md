A cold wallet is a method to store cryptocurrency funds where the private keys are kept offline, meaning they are not connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This offline nature is why they are referred to as "cold storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Security and Purpose
Cold wallets are considered significantly more secure than [[cold_wallets_vs_hot_wallets_what_users_should_know | hot wallets]] because hackers cannot directly access the private keys unless specific user errors are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. They offer a higher level of [[security_features_of_cold_wallets | security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While there are extra steps involved in using cold wallets, these steps are well worth the effort for enhanced [[steps_for_enhancing_personal_security_in_crypto | security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is advisable to store primary funds for trading on cold wallets due to their security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Funds stored on [[security_risks_of_hot_wallets | hot wallets]] are much more susceptible to compromise compared to those on cold wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Key Storage Practices
The primary concern for cold wallet users is to prevent loss or misplacement of the recovery phrase or keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Backing Up Recovery Phrases
It is crucial to always back up your recovery phrase or keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Offline Storage:** Never store your recovery phrase or keys online, as this would negate the entire purpose of having a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Physical Storage:** Store your recovery phrase in a safe physical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   Writing it down on a piece of paper and stowing it away is a common method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   Ideally, the storage medium should be fireproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   Ensure the location is known to you and easily recallable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Considerations
While cold wallets offer superior security, they do involve a bit more "friction" compared to hot wallets, which are known for their ease of use and speed in conducting transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Therefore, cold wallets are best suited for storing larger amounts of cryptocurrency that are not needed for frequent transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

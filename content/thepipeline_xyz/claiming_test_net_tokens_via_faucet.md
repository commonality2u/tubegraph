To begin interacting with the [[monad_public_test_net_launch | Monad public test net]], the first step is to acquire test net tokens through the faucet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

## Initial Steps

Before claiming tokens, ensure your wallet is [[connecting_wallets_to_monad_test_net | connected to the Monad Testnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. This can be done by visiting the Monad Testnet landing page at `testnet.monad.xyz` or `monadtest.phantom.me` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Using the Faucet

The process for obtaining test net tokens is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>:
1.  Paste your public wallet address into the designated field on the faucet page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.
2.  Click the "Get Testnet Monad" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

## Important Considerations

*   The amount of test net tokens your wallet can claim may vary based on certain parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.
*   The faucet refreshes throughout the day, so it is advisable to check it daily for more tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
*   Once you have test net tokens, you can proceed to [[making_transactions_on_monad_test_net | make your first transaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.

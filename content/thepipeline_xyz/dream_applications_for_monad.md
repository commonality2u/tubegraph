When asked about a [[dream_app_concept_for_monad_platform | dream app]] for the [[introduction_to_monad_for_developers_and_users | Monad]] platform, the response centered on a social application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Vision for a Social Application
The ideal [[dream_app_creation_for_monad_platform | dream app]] on [[introduction_to_monad_for_developers_and_users | Monad]] would be a social application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This is because social applications represent a significant and important area within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While there are already many promising [[projects_in_monad | apps on it]], there is a desire to see more "formidable Founders building this very seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

It is believed that such a social app could be the breakthrough application that reaches "nomies" (non-crypto users) before any other type of application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

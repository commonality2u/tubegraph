The final discussion on behavioral science and green public governance focuses on the critical role of human behavior in addressing environmental threats, particularly climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 recognized that sustainable lifestyles and consumption patterns are vital for tackling climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In 2021, it is widely accepted that human behavior is a core target for governments dealing with environmental challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

[[behavioral_public_policy | Behavioral public policy]] in sustainability has been a top area for behavioral scientists over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges

While there have been many successful applications of [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]], such as feedback interventions to reduce energy consumption or better product labeling to encourage sustainable spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, a significant challenge remains:
*   **Late Integration**: Behavioral science has primarily been used to improve policies already implemented, rather than informing early policy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Systemic Transformation**: Public governance systems require deep and broad transformations to effectively implement urgent green policy measures and achieve a net-zero carbon future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This means integrating [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science in policy making]] earlier in the process, during the design of environmental policies, discussion of new taxes, and stakeholder consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Moving to Systemic Change**: It's time to shift from localized behavioral solutions to systemic change, empowering public governance with new choice architectures where information, regulation, and financial incentives facilitate green habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Promising Pathways for [[role_of_behavioral_science_in_government | Behavioral Science in Government]]

Experts highlight several promising avenues for [[mainstreaming_behavioral_science_in_government | mainstreaming behavioral science in government]]:

### Strategic Application
*   **Anticipating Public Response**: Understanding how people are likely to respond to specific policy measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **New Policy Tools**: Providing novel tools for green policy proposals, such as changing choice architecture or leveraging social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.
*   **Improving Acceptability**: Enhancing the public's acceptance of reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Anticipating Implementation/Evaluation Issues**: Foreseeing challenges in the rollout and assessment of reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Behavioral Science as a Diagnostic Tool
*   **System Diagnostic**: Using [[behavioral science in public policy | behavioral science in public policy]] to understand why people *don't* change behavior, providing clues about systemic drivers or structures that prevent desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This helps governments identify other necessary tools beyond incentives or persuasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Policy Agenda Setting**: Applying [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] not just to achieve goals, but to help define what those goals should be in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Garnering Policy Support
*   **Softening the Audience**: Using behavioral science to encourage public support for policies *before* implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Research suggests that people already performing pro-environmental behaviors are more likely to support related policies, even when controlling for attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Spillover Effects**: Leveraging one pro-environmental behavior to encourage another, ultimately leading to policy support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Identity plays a crucial role in fostering this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Governments can influence the identity of communities by highlighting existing positive actions, encouraging further support for new policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.

### Methodological Innovations
*   **"Nudge Plus"**: Engaging citizens directly in the design and even testing of behavioral interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This human-centered approach, particularly effective at local levels, leverages citizens as "experts of everyday life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.
*   **Digital Nudges with Immediate Feedback**: These can act as standalone tools, particularly in environmental areas, as learning is most effective with quick, valuable, and personalized feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.
*   **Empirical Thinking**: Embracing systematic testing of interventions, acknowledging that people are not purely "econs" (rational agents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

## Successful Interventions in Practice

### Energy Consumption
*   **Opower's Social Norms**: Based on a 1990s study, Opower sends energy bills comparing a household's energy use to its neighbors' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This intervention, leveraging descriptive norms, typically results in 2-6% energy reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Success is enhanced by specific comparisons (e.g., "people like you") and positive affirmations for low users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. This approach has been widely replicated globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Home Power Savings Program (Australia)**: A large program for low-income households initially saw energy savings primarily from installed energy-efficient kits (e.g., low-energy light globes, low-flow showerheads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. However, the persuasive efforts of assessors were largely ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. By training assessors in [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights]] (commitment devices, limited choice, and social norms), energy efficiency increased by 4-5% and was scaled across the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
*   **Improving Information Comprehension (Ireland)**: Experiments pre-testing different ways of presenting time-of-use tariffs for smart meters showed that a simple table performed better than an intuitive clock visual in improving comprehension and enabling consumers to choose beneficial tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

## Limitations and Challenges

*   **Awareness Is Not Enough**: Simple "nudge" interventions, such as letters encouraging heat pump installation, may increase inquiries but not actual installations if only one barrier (awareness) is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. Complex issues require tackling multiple barriers simultaneously with multi-pronged interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
*   **Over-reliance on Incentives**: The assumption that financial incentives alone (e.g., lower energy bills) will drive behavior change is often flawed, as people are not always purely rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. Even heavily subsidized energy-efficient appliances faced low uptake if any debt was involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.
*   **Digital Energy Meters**: Universal rollout of digital energy meters with the assumption that people would access data, learn, and reduce consumption largely failed; very few access their data, and even fewer change behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.
*   **Small Effect Sizes**: While interventions like social norms are effective, their effect sizes can be relatively small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. However, even small improvements across a large audience can yield significant aggregate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

## Key Policy Domains for [[behavioral_science_in_environmental_policy | Behavioral Science in Environmental Policy]]

Beyond energy, [[behavioral science in public policy | behavioral science in public policy]] can contribute to numerous areas:
*   **Water Conservation**: Past droughts, like Australia's four-five year drought, created a significant public appetite for water conservation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   **[[behavioral_science_in_environmental_policy | Climate Change]]**: Continues to be a central focus given global conferences like COP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
*   **Biodiversity**: Major reports highlighting significant biodiversity loss and upcoming international targets (like Kunming) present a key policy window for behavioral science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
*   **Waste Management**: Issues such as the China Sword policy impacting recycling tolerance for contamination created policy windows for behavior change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
*   **Circular Economy**: Applying behavioral thinking to reduce food waste, such as working with cities to create easy, hassle-free environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

## Addressing Carbon Tax and Financial Incentives

Financial disincentives like a carbon tax are often politically sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>. [[behavioral insights in public policy | Behavioral insights in public policy]] can help design them smarter:
*   **"Climate Bonus"**: An upfront payment to households, framed as a "climate bonus" and provided at the beginning of the year, can increase acceptance of carbon taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. This approach also helps prevent energy poverty and excessive strain on poorer households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Clear, honest, and straightforward communication is vital, as people dislike being tricked or manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>. Transparency is key for good governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

## Industry and Systemic Change

While consumer behavior is important, a significant portion of carbon emissions comes from industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
*   **Organizational Behavior**: Individual behavioral models can effectively explain and predict organizational behavior. Businesses act based on perceived benefits, social pressure, and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
*   **Normative and Consumer Pressure**: Organizations are highly responsive to normative influences (e.g., rivals adopting green policies) and pressure from customers opting for greener products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.
*   **Beyond Nudges**: Behavioral science should complement, not replace, "harder" regulations and financial incentives. Governments should not use behavioral insights as an easy way out to avoid necessary laws, bans (e.g., toxic materials, plastic packaging), or smart regulation that stimulates innovation (e.g., sandbox regulation for experiments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>.
*   **Reducing Sludge**: Many decisions, even in companies, are made within "sludgy" environments (e.g., bureaucratic processes, immense waiting times for installers like heat pump plumbers in the UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>. [[implementing_behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | Implementing behavioral insights in public policy]] includes "sludge assessments" to remove unnecessary barriers and make desired behaviors easier for individuals and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Global Context**: People's willingness to change is influenced by whether their governments are adhering to international commitments (e.g., rich countries owing poorer countries for climate funds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

## Call to Action for Policymakers

To effectively leverage [[role_of_leadership_and_governance_in_behavioral_policy | behavioral science in public policy]]:
*   **Embed Behavioral Insights**: Make the use of [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] a standard, embedded step in the policy process, akin to conducting a cost-benefit analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. This moves beyond individual-driven projects to systemic integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Tools like toolkits that explain the behavioral assumptions behind different policy approaches can aid this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>.
*   **Implement Green Defaults**: Integrate green defaults into all policies (e.g., procurement, schools). Defaults can significantly change mindsets and drive faster action, which is crucial given time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>. Awareness of unintended side effects (redistributive, boomerang, rebound effects) is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.
*   **Prioritize and Coordinate Efforts**: Identify a few high-impact behaviors that are relatively easy to change and rally all stakeholders around them. An example is the City of Townsville's program to encourage households to paint their roofs white, coordinating small businesses, supply chains, communications, and subsidies around this single, impactful behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Learn from other disciplines like human-centered design and architecture, as they offer valuable insights into how people interact with spaces and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. The use of citizen juries and panels can also aid policy design and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.

Collaborative frameworks are fundamental to addressing complex health challenges through mission-oriented innovation. These approaches emphasize multi-stakeholder engagement and coordinated efforts across various sectors to achieve ambitious, purpose-driven outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Principles of Collaboration in Missions
Missions are defined as purpose-driven, ambitious tasks and outcomes that require collective innovation to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. They aim to solve problems rather than just improve existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Key principles include:
*   **Broad Engagement** Missions allow for higher and broader engagement beyond traditional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Stronger Direction and Momentum** They provide a clear direction towards public goods and generate significant momentum and inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>.
*   **Policy Coordination** Collaborative frameworks lead to fewer overlaps, more collective action, and consistent plans across different silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.
*   **Neutral and Open Approach** They coordinate diverse actions to explore various solutions to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
*   **Intentional Policy Mix** Collaboration involves combining different tools and articulating supply and demand for knowledge and innovation, including pooling resources and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.
*   **Trust and Transparency** Building trust among diverse partners is essential for effective [[cocreation_and_stakeholder_engagement_in_mission_setting | co-creation]] and sharing of risks and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.

## Examples of Collaborative Frameworks

### Vision Zero Cancer (Sweden)
Vision Zero Cancer is a vision-driven innovation milieu in Sweden that engages actors across society in strategic [[stakeholder_collaboration_in_healthcare | collaborations]] to combat cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   **Quadruple Helix Model** The initiative builds on a long tradition of collaboration, moving from a "triple helix" (healthcare, academia, industry) to a "quintuple helix" by placing citizens and patients at the center, and engaging the public sector and authorities for systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   **Multi-Stakeholder Initiative** It is a multi-stakeholder initiative for system innovation and cancer control, established by the Swedish Innovation Agency Vinnova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   **Governance** Vision Zero Cancer is managed as a partnership and coordinated by the Stockholm School of Economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. Its founding partners include large industrial companies (e.g., AstraZeneca), the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, the Confederation of Regional Cancer Centers, the Cancer Society, lung cancer study groups, think tanks, patient associations, academia, and industry associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. It currently has around 40 engaged partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Objective** The aim is to create a "one-stop shop" for innovation in cancer care in Sweden, moving from isolated initiatives to a national point of contact for system innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

### German National Decade Against Cancer
Launched in January 2019 by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), this mission is part of Germany's High-Tech Strategy 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:11">[01:37:11]</a>.
*   **Key Players** It brings together numerous key players in personalized cancer medicine, including those from medicine, research, society (patients included), politics, health ministries, regulatory authorities, and the business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.
*   **Structure** A strategy committee, composed of various stakeholder groups and led by the federal ministry and the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), oversees the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>. This high-level political involvement ensures broad support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:47">[01:42:47]</a>.
*   **Patient Involvement** A significant focus is on improving patient participation in research and changing the culture of cancer research towards patient-oriented approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:41">[01:49:41]</a>. Patient representatives are included in strategic committees, working groups, and evaluation panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:20">[01:52:20]</a>.
*   **Supporter Concept** Interested organizations (research, care, patient support, public) can apply to become official supporters of the decade, fostering broad involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:44:52]</a>.

### Health Holland and Dutch Top Sector Policy for Life Sciences and Health Missions
This framework supports the central mission of health and care in the Netherlands, designed by the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:50">[01:55:50]</a>.
*   **Coordination Role** Health Holland coordinates the realization of missions, working with researchers, entrepreneurs, governments, and citizens at local, regional, and national scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:51">[01:56:51]</a>.
*   **Extensive Partnership** The initiative involves 97 partners who invest in the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:30">[01:57:30]</a>, with 17 organizations in the governance structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:50">[01:57:50]</a>.
*   **Field Labs** A key implementation instrument is the "field lab," which involves working directly with people where problems occur, fostering a "coalition of the willing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:46">[01:58:46]</a>. These are often existing physical initiatives or teams that commit to mission goals, population impact (e.g., 100,000 people), and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:51">[02:07:51]</a>.
*   **Multi-Level Perspective** This model describes the process towards sustainable transition by connecting layers:
    *   **Niche Layer:** Local initiatives serving as incubation rooms for radical innovation and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:44">[02:01:44]</a>.
    *   **Regime Layer:** Existing infrastructure and "business as usual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:29">[02:01:29]</a>.
    *   **Landscape Layer:** Global trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a>.
*   **Connections and Learning** The process involves individuals ("birds") moving between layers to connect people and organizations, building trust, and [[cocreation_and_stakeholder_engagement_in_mission_setting | co-creating]] to reach a "tipping point" for systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:33">[02:02:33]</a>. Peer-to-peer and national-to-field lab learning infrastructures are established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:56">[02:12:56]</a>.

### Camden Council's Food Mission (UK)
This local government initiative in London addresses food poverty, climate emergency, and inequalities through a mission-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:46">[02:19:46]</a>.
*   **Community-Driven Movement** The missions are seen as a vehicle to grow a movement, starting with a council decision but driven continuously by the rich community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:57">[02:19:57]</a>.
*   **Renewal Commission** An advisory body, co-chaired by Mariana Mazzucato, involved a diverse group from the community, voluntary sectors, media, and businesses to gather real-life experiences and deliberate on missions using data and evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:54">[02:18:54]</a>.
*   **"Mission on a Page" Tool** This framework helps capture mission components: layers, story, issues, system problems, opportunity areas, tools/levers, and success measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:18">[02:21:18]</a>.
*   **Enabling Infrastructure** The council aims to create an enabling infrastructure that empowers different actors and facilitates communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>. This includes bottom-up funding for resident initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:21">[02:24:21]</a>.
*   **Political Will and Vulnerability** Senior leadership backing and continuous support are crucial for navigating uncertainty and allowing for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:57">[02:24:57]</a>. The approach requires vulnerability, listening, and openness to criticism to truly improve public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>.

## Common Challenges in Collaborative Frameworks
Implementing mission-oriented approaches involves several [[challenges_in_implementing_missiondriven_approaches | challenges]]:
*   **Defining Clear Missions** It can be difficult to set bold, targeted, and measurable missions, avoiding "mission washing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
*   **Going Beyond ST&I** A challenge is moving beyond science, technology, and innovation (ST&I) to address behavioral and systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.
*   **Complex Governance** Multi-level, cross-ministerial, cross-agency, and cross-silo governance structures can be complex and burdensome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement** Engaging non-ST&I stakeholders, including citizens, can be particularly hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact** Measuring the impact of systemic interventions differs from fragmented measures, and appropriate methodologies and [[tools_and_frameworks_for_evaluating_mission_impact | tools]] are often lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>.
*   **Scaling Up** Mission-oriented initiatives may succeed in specific subsystems but struggle with scaling up these successes more broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.
*   **Managing Conflicts of Interest** Identifying and managing conflicts of interest, especially in smaller expert communities, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>. Diversifying membership in advisory panels helps mitigate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Commitment** Maintaining stakeholder attention and engagement over a decade-long mission can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:56">[01:47:56]</a>.
*   **Aligning Diverse Interests** [[challenges_in_coordinating_stakeholders_in_mission_oriented_policies | Accommodating and aligning the diverse and particular interests]] of involved stakeholders (researchers, patients, insurers, industry) is an ongoing challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a>.
*   **Cultural Change** Shifting organizational cultures, such as encouraging clinicians to seriously consider patient input, requires sustained effort and informed participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:41">[01:49:41]</a>.
*   **Communicating Uncertainty** It's challenging to communicate that missions operate in conditions of uncertainty and may not have immediate, predictable outcomes, especially to internal and external stakeholders accustomed to traditional project planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>.
*   **Tempo Differences** Bridging the gap between the fast-paced demands of local initiatives and the slower, more deliberate pace of national policy-making is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:52">[02:14:52]</a>.
*   **Language Matters** Using inclusive and encouraging language that resonates with diverse stakeholders, rather than technical jargon, is key to fostering shared understanding and buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a>.

## Fostering Resilience and Adaptation
To remain adaptive over long timeframes, strategies include:
*   **Early Evaluation** Conducting early evaluations of funded grants and activities to assess whether objectives are being met and to refine priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Partnerships** Actively identifying and engaging partners (not just financial) who can leverage, harness, and advocate for the mission to increase its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning** Embracing a continuous learning journey and being prepared to pivot and rethink structures and processes when they no longer serve the mission's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>.
*   **Internal Communication** Continuously communicating with internal stakeholders to convince them that mission-oriented approaches are enablers, not additional burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:03">[02:24:03]</a>.

Overall, [[missionoriented_approaches_and_cocreation | collaborative efforts]] are seen as essential for achieving systemic change and addressing complex health challenges, despite the inherent [[challenges_in_implementing_missiondriven_approaches | challenges]] of multi-stakeholder coordination and long-term commitment.

[[public_sector_innovation|Public sector innovation]] is defined as something that is novel in its context, is implemented, and brings about a shift in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Innovations can vary in size, from big to small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The process of innovating can be more or less certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It can emerge in a directed, top-down way or from a bottom-up, undirected way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## OECD Public Sector Innovation Model

Recognizing that [[public_sector_innovation|public sector innovation]] has many different facets, the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation developed a [[public_sector_innovation|public sector innovation]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This model is based on two core features of innovation:
*   How directed it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   How uncertain the process is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

From these two axes, four different [[types_of_public_sector_innovation|facets of innovation]] emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
1.  Enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
2.  Mission-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
3.  Anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
4.  Adaptive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

### Enhancement-Oriented Innovation
This type of innovation aims to make existing products, services, and processes more effective and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Example**: Using behavioural insights to encourage people to pay their taxes on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Mission-Oriented Innovation
Mission-oriented innovation sets out to solve specific problems and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Example 1**: The historical effort to get humans to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Example 2**: The contemporary shift to sustainable energy to counteract climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Anticipatory Innovation
This facet of innovation tries to influence future developments before they become fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Example**: Exploring the ethical and technological boundaries that artificial intelligence projects should follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Adaptive Innovation
Adaptive innovation involves the exploration of what is possible, a process of discovery of what could be or might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Example**: Social media has introduced new ways for government and citizens to interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This has not only reshaped citizen expectations but also created new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## The Importance of a Balanced Portfolio

Because innovation is multifaceted, there is no single "one-size-fits-all" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Focusing on only one or two facets can lead to uneven innovation efforts and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Therefore, government needs a balanced [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] portfolio, ensuring all innovation facets are covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

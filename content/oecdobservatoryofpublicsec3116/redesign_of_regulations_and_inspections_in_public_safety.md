The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the need for a fundamental [[public_administration_reform | systematic change]] in how governments approach policies, particularly regarding public safety regulations and inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. The pandemic has revealed existing vulnerabilities and created new needs, pushing for a re-evaluation of current systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>.

## Critiques of Current Regulatory Systems

During the crisis, inspections and many regulations in Europe were halted for months, yet society did not collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>. This observation suggests that much of the existing regulation, particularly in safety and security fields, may not be effective. It is estimated that perhaps 80% of regulation does not correspond with a positive outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>. For example, emergency exit signs, mandated by worldwide regulation, are known by scientists not to be looked at during emergencies, yet remain in regulations and are inspected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.

Marco Steinberg also pointed to the failure of traditional preparedness models, citing Finland's 2008 pandemic preparedness strategy which was not updated and its strategic reserves (masks, ventilators) were expired when opened for the first time since World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. Furthermore, a lack of integration between four different agencies at Helsinki Airport meant that a government decree for quarantine did not translate into effective action on the ground, with 200,000 people entering without instruction after the policy was in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. This highlights a "very linear kind of industrial way of thinking about preparedness" that left systems unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.

Piret TÃµnurist noted that governments often engage in regulations that create a "sense of false security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

## Proposed Redesign Strategies

A core proposal for [[innovations in regulatory systems | systemic change]] in public safety involves shifting the responsibility for controlling, inspecting, and even writing detailed regulations from governments to relevant actors within society, often coupled with insurance mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

### Examples of Redesigned Approaches:
*   **French Building System:** Instead of elaborate government checks on building regulation, individuals must demonstrate they are insured. The insurance company then decides on the necessary inspections, often taking a risk-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. An insurance company would not inspect for useless measures like emergency exit signs that don't affect safety outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.
*   **Netherlands Dangerous Goods Transport:** After a series of accidents in the 1990s, the system was changed to impose a legal, risk-based liability of 10 million euros on anyone transporting dangerous goods, requiring them to be insured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. This combination led to a remarkable improvement in safety within one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>. However, this approach can make it almost impossible for small or amateur companies to operate in certain high-risk areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

These examples demonstrate the potential of [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_regulation | public-private partnerships in regulation]] and a shift towards outcome-based regulation, where focus moves from strict adherence to rules to ensuring positive safety outcomes. This approach could allow governments to cut inspection costs by 80-90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.

## Barriers to Regulatory Redesign

Despite the potential benefits and the clear need for change, significant barriers exist:
*   **"Greedy Government":** Governments often find it difficult to relinquish responsibilities and tend to take on more, driven by a deep distrust of society's ability to self-regulate without detailed governmental oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>.
*   **Institutional Resistance:** Regulatory bodies and inspection agencies resist changes that would lead to budget and staff cuts, which are inherent in reducing inspection loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.
*   **Political Pressure for Quick Impact:** Policymakers, especially in democratic systems, face strong pressures to show quick results before the next election, which tends to stimulate more linear thinking rather than complex systemic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.
*   **Lack of Integrated Approach:** Decision-making during the COVID-19 crisis in many countries often focused narrowly on disease control, ignoring broader health care or economic implications, demonstrating a lack of an integral or [[agile_regulatory_approaches | systems-based approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>.
*   **Inability to Admit Mistakes:** Policymakers may be unwilling to admit past mistakes, hindering the adoption of new, more effective approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:39">[01:24:39]</a>.

## Moving Forward

Overcoming these barriers requires a shift in mindset and new capabilities within government. This includes:
*   **[[the_role_of_data_in_regulation | Grounded Research]] and Real-time Learning:** Utilizing real-time data and grounded research, including ethnographic methods, to understand the lived experience of how policies affect people and to adjust interventions rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:23">[01:24:23]</a>.
*   **Embedding Learning Teams:** Establishing "learning teams" within the core of government and on the frontlines to capture insights and foster continuous adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.
*   **New Leadership Models:** Developing leadership models not solely built around risks and probabilities, but capable of absorbing and transforming systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>.
*   **Broader Stakeholder Engagement:** Ensuring diverse perspectives, including citizens and stakeholders, are at the table, as seen in the call for a "socially engaged process" for exit strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>. This includes addressing biases in team composition for policy responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>.
*   **Redefining Preparedness:** Shifting from a linear, industrial view of preparedness to one that acknowledges interdependencies and allows for agile, adaptive responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This could involve considering keeping some industrial capacity within nations (e.g., for masks) rather than relying solely on global offshore models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.
*   **Investing in Austerity:** Utilizing impending budget shortfalls as an opportunity to "cut to invest" in new capabilities and future-oriented systems, rather than simply "cut to save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>.
*   **[[innovative_public_service_design | Regenerative Public Services]]:** Exploring models that move beyond traditional bureaucracy (Tekaal) towards systems that are regenerative and restorative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. This implies a shift from "doing things right" to "doing the right things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.

The crisis provides a "window of opportunity" to pursue [[agile_regulatory_governance | systemic change]] and rethink how government operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.

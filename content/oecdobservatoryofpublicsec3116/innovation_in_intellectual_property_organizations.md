The experience of IP Australia, the Australian government agency responsible for issuing intellectual property (IP) rights, offers a case study in fostering [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation in the public sector]] and within intellectual property organizations specifically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## IP Australia's Context and Operational Model

IP Australia issues intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, designs, and plant breeders' rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. It also promotes awareness of IP rights as part of Australia's innovation ecosystem and contributes to government advice on IP policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The organization operates as a cost-recovered agency, funding its operations and investments through fees charged for patents and trademarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This financial independence is identified as a key factor in its [[Innovation Strategies for Governments | innovation journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Innovation Journey and Key Milestones

IP Australia's [[government innovation practices | innovation journey]] began significantly around eight years prior to the discussion (circa 2012) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, largely spearheaded by former Director-General Patricia Kelly and her executive team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

Key milestones include:
*   **Capability Review Catalyst** A capability review suggested that IP Australia's culture and embrace of [[Innovation in public administration | innovation in public administration]] could be enhanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This served as a platform for deliberate strategic choice by leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Leadership Commitment** Momentum from the leadership team was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. They embraced the opportunity through clear vision and a strategic plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Innovation Budget** A significant commitment involved dedicating a small percentage (less than 1%) of the annual budget explicitly to innovation, experimentation, technology, and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This included an acceptance that some experiments might not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **Office of the Chief Economist** The establishment of the Office of the Chief Economist in 2012 helped build economic expertise, data, and analysis, providing a better structure for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This helped the agency proactively engage in the innovation discussion in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   **Strategic Roadmap** A clear strategic direction, "Roadmap to 2030," was published and incorporated into annual corporate plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. This roadmap utilized a three-horizons approach, setting high-level guardrails and forcing continuous questioning about how to achieve long-term ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. It allowed for risk-taking and collaborative effort across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Empowering Staff** The agency established staff-led ideas and encouraged proposals from employees, leading to a multi-directional approach to [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This encouraged staff to take risks and unleash their highly technical skills, particularly in STEM fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

## Manifestations of Innovation

IP Australia's [[government innovation practices | innovation practices]] have led to several notable projects:

*   **Trademark Search** Introduced in February 2017, this tool was revolutionary for combining image searching and machine learning to drastically simplify trademark searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Users could upload a logo for an instant search across 400,000 images, reducing rejections and saving time and money for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. This project was a result of [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_innovation | collaboration]] with a private sector company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, and led to a 54% reduction in trademark search-related calls to their call center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **Trademark Assist** Launched in 2018, this interactive tool educates and assists trademark applicants through the initial application stages, using machine learning to help submit high-quality applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. It has been used by 41,000 users since its launch and has increased successful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.
*   **"Cognitive Futures" Program** This program allows for experimentation, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, to apply these technologies to IP administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
*   **Internal Quality Assurance System** This less "sexy" but crucial innovation involved changes to internal quality assurance, ranging from compliance to the quality of examination reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. It involved a complex, passionately driven change to a new system within 12 months, including building new IT infrastructure and managing cultural shifts among staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## Managing Risk and Collaboration

IP Australia explicitly accepts risk, dedicating a small percentage of its budget to experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. The organization employs agile methodology for early prototyping, allowing for fast identification of issues and concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

Large-scale IT projects, such as the "Rides in One Rio" program (a comprehensive overhaul of trademark systems completed in late 2019), involve significant inherent risk because IP systems are unique and bespoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. At one point in late 2018, external advisors indicated that IP Australia was "maxed out on risk" due to four very large, simultaneous transformation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Leadership's appetite for risk and backing of experts were critical in navigating these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

[[Publicprivate partnerships for innovation | Collaboration with the private sector]] is important for building capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. Success depends on trust, long-term working relationships, and viewing private sector partners as collaborators, rather than focusing solely on traditional government procurement contracts that define every output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>.

## Innovation and Crisis (COVID-19)

IP Australia's prior investments in flexible work arrangements and infrastructure positioned it well to respond to the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure**: They had invested in activity-based working spaces, laptops for all staff, good Wi-Fi, and audio-visual equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.
*   **Culture**: A flexible workplace policy and strong trust relationships with staff, coupled with a deliberate cultural change management piece, ensured managers encouraged staff to embrace new opportunities rather than insist on physical presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: The agency was able to scale from 100 people working remotely to 1,000 people working remotely in one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.
*   **Preparedness**: The existence of a National Pandemic Plan, developed years prior (after H1N1) and regularly updated, along with scenario planning and business continuity exercises, also played a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

The crisis reinforced confidence in the organization's ability to innovate and underscored the importance of strategic risk management and scenario planning for unpredictable futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

## Challenges and Continuous Improvement

Despite its achievements, IP Australia continues to face challenges and pursue continuous improvement:

*   **Communicating Complex Ideas**: Technical staff need to effectively communicate complex [[types of innovation within public sector organizations | innovative ideas]] to non-technical staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>. This requires strong internal communication from leadership, explaining strategic direction and risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. Layered communication, starting from the high-level vision and providing specific examples, is helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
*   **Balancing [[types of innovation within public sector organizations | Types of Innovation]]**: IP Australia has experienced both radical/game-changing innovations (e.g., rapid digital adoption, AI tools) and "hard yards" improvements (e.g., quality management systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>. Using models like the innovation facets model (distinguishing between sustaining, transformational, mission-oriented, and adaptive innovation) helps the leadership team manage the pace of change and avoid "change exhaustion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
*   **Bottom-Up Innovation**: For individuals driving change from the bottom up in organizations less committed to [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation]], it's advised to:
    *   Understand the strategic objectives and risks of leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.
    *   Frame proposed innovations within that context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>.
    *   Avoid overselling, be prepared to fail fast, and be open to evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.
    *   Develop strong communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.
    *   Do homework, talk to customers and stakeholders, and bring evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.
    *   Starting with adaptive or enhancement-oriented [[types of innovation within public sector organizations | innovation]] can build comfort and confidence before tackling more transformative projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.
*   **Formal Learning from Failure**: While some projects don't achieve all outcomes, a more systematic approach to failure reports and lessons learned could be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Vigilance**: IP Australia needs to continuously refresh its strategic roadmap and strategic plan (e.g., Roadmap to 2030) to ensure it remains relevant to a changing world and fosters vigilance about future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.
*   **Risk Culture Maturity**: Building people's confidence in understanding and dealing with risk is an ongoing responsibility for everyone in the organization, including addressing areas where risk maturity models show segments are not fully conscious of risk management frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>.

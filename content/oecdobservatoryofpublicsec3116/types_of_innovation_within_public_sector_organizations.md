The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) works with an [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] facets model that recognizes different types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21">[03:21]</a>, even if these types are not explicitly acknowledged or managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45">[03:45]</a>. Organizations inherently have a portfolio of innovation projects and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58">[03:58]</a>.

While there are various ways to categorize [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]], such as from incremental to "blue sky thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18">[04:18]</a>, OPSI emphasizes looking at [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] from its *purpose* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27">[04:27]</a>.

## OPSI's Innovation Facets Model

OPSI categorizes [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] into four main types based on their purpose:

*   **Mission-oriented [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34">[04:34]</a>:
    *   Aims to achieve specific, agreed-upon goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02">[05:02]</a>.
    *   Characterized by a top-down approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18">[06:18]</a>.
    *   Once goals are set, [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] is directed towards achieving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31">[06:31]</a>.
    *   Leaders provide strong support from the top down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30">[09:30]</a>.
    *   An example is a political goal like "climate neutral Lund by 2030" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51">[42:51]</a>. Such missions often receive significant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:56">[42:56]</a>.

*   **Enhancement [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35">[04:35]</a>:
    *   Focuses on improving current operations, making them more effective, efficient, or reaching more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08">[05:08]</a>.
    *   Operates within existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49">[06:49]</a>.
    *   Driven by high levels of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46">[06:46]</a>.
    *   Often pushed by factors like austerity, cost reduction, or increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51">[06:51]</a>.
    *   Public sector organizations with highly specialized, skilled staff often excel in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09">[39:09]</a>.

*   **Adaptive [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36">[04:36]</a>:
    *   Responds to new ideas and evolving situations from within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20">[05:20]</a>.
    *   Cannot be steered purely top-down, as the exact demands from a shifting environment are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05">[07:05]</a>.
    *   Requires creating open space for creativity, experimentation, and exploration by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22">[07:22]</a>.
    *   Service providers, particularly those connected to welfare services or working directly with families, tend to engage in a lot of adaptive [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] as they respond to immediate feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15">[36:15]</a>.

*   **Anticipatory [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38">[04:38]</a>:
    *   Addresses new risks, uncertainties, and future developments that may question current public sector activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38">[05:38]</a>.
    *   Aims to prepare in advance for fundamental shifts and changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51">[05:51]</a>.
    *   Operates in an area of high uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36">[07:36]</a>.
    *   Ideas in this space might be critical to an organization's strategic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43">[07:43]</a>.
    *   An organization whose job is to think about next technologies, like NASA or the European Space Agency, would have a portfolio heavily skewed towards anticipatory and mission-oriented [[innovation in public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02">[37:02]</a>.
    *   It should be allowed within an [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] portfolio to question the mission itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:27">[52:27]</a>.

## Managing Innovation Portfolios

Regardless of an organization's primary focus, it must also perform other types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] (e.g., a "mission-oriented" organization still needs to "do things better" or "adapt") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21">[08:21]</a>. The key is to manage these different types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] meaningfully and allow them to coexist without becoming locked into one approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07">[08:07]</a>.

[[public sector innovation | Public sector innovation]] portfolio management is not a new concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56">[08:56]</a>. Effective management requires:
*   **Understanding the portfolio**: Knowing which types of innovations an organization is working on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03">[09:03]</a>.
*   **Assigned stewardship**: Someone must be responsible for making sense of the [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] information and making decisions based on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10">[09:10]</a>, ideally as an ongoing activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.
*   **Supportive structures**: Creating environments where different types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] can coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18">[09:18]</a>. For adaptive [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]], this means creating space for it; for mission-oriented [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]], it requires strong leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24">[09:24]</a>.
*   **Synergy and resource allocation**: Portfolios should allow different purposes to merge and connect synergies between different types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35">[09:35]</a>. This includes questioning how different [[types and purposes of innovation in the public sector | types of innovation]] are resourced, monitored, and evaluated across the entire portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51">[09:51]</a>.
*   **Overall performance**: The success of a portfolio is more important than the success of individual innovations, as single innovations are inherently risky and can fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. A 100% success rate in innovation suggests insufficient risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.
*   **Learning and communication**: Managing learning and communication about and within the portfolio is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.

### Portfolio Balance

"Portfolio balance" does not mean having an equal number of projects or equal funding for each type of [[public sector innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43">[35:43]</a>. Instead, it means that the mix of [[types of public sector innovation | innovation types]] should align with the organization's strategic aims and purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52">[37:52]</a>. For example, a caregiving organization might be heavily adaptive, while a space agency would be more anticipatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12">[36:12]</a>.

It is important to avoid "lock-ins," ensuring that even if a portfolio is unbalanced towards certain strategic aims, it still supports different types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] to allow for new information and different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03">[08:03]</a>.

## The Portfolio Exploration Tool

The OPSI team developed a self-service "Portfolio Exploration Tool" to help organizations understand and manage their [[public sector innovation | innovation]] portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>. This tool:
*   Identifies where to develop [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>.
*   Recommends actions based on results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.
*   Helps explore changes over time and areas for intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.
*   Provides individualized guidance and a portfolio management capability score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>.
*   Allows for "project-based mapping," where users input their projects to see their placement within the different [[types and purposes of innovation in the public sector | innovation types]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:59">[01:41:59]</a>.
*   Provides guidance on what it means when organizational balance and project maps don't align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>.
*   Offers anonymized aggregate data, providing a global, continuously updated picture of [[public sector innovation trends | innovation trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>.

### Application of the Tool

The tool can be used at different levels of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>:
*   **Individual level**: To understand one's own or one's team's perspective on [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.
*   **Team level**: To make a case for a deeper portfolio look, see how a team fits into the organizational portfolio, and decide on a team's role or raise specific issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
*   **Senior management/advisor level**: To get a snapshot, build a strategy, or align organizational efforts with ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

The tool aims to facilitate conversations about [[definition of public sector innovation | innovation]] and strategy that might otherwise be long overdue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. It provides a structured way to discuss and define starting points for strategic development and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. It also helps identify areas where [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] is not being considered or resourced appropriately (e.g., enhancement and anticipatory areas in Lund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>.

### Challenges and Insights from Practice

*   **Defining innovation**: A common challenge is getting everyone within an organization on the same page about what [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] actually means and what should be included in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>. The tool does not automatically filter out "non-innovations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:44">[01:15:44]</a>.
*   **Overcoming bureaucratic hurdles**: In public sector organizations, managing [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] can risk becoming bogged down in transparency, authority, and rule-based structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. The key is to blend a systematic approach with people-relational orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.
*   **Role of facilitators**: A neutral facilitator is needed to negotiate between different areas' needs and to manage the gaps in the [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.
*   **Patience and persistence**: Successful [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] portfolio management takes time (e.g., three years for a project in Lund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. It involves "knitting things together in small steps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>.
*   **Communication strategy**: Focus on strengths and successes to motivate staff and avoid being associated with problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   **Synergies and Discords**: The tool helps visualize not only synergies but also discords between projects. Sometimes, discord is by design, as anticipatory projects might deliberately question missions to prepare for fundamental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>.
*   **Organizational Culture**: An organization's culture, its appetite for risk and uncertainty, and the capacity of its staff to engage in [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.

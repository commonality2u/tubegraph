Innovation has emerged as a crucial element for governments navigating the complexities of crises and recovery. The "Government Beyond Recovery" conference, held in October in partnership with the Slovenian presidency of the Council of the European Union and the European Institute of Public Administration, highlighted the opportunity that innovation offers to transform government functions and improve public outcomes in the wake of the [[the_economic_impact_of_the_pandemic_and_recovery_strategies | pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Why Innovation Matters Post-COVID

The [[impact of COVID19 on global innovation | COVID-19 pandemic]] has underscored the need for governments to leverage [[innovation strategies | innovative approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. While the immediate crisis compelled innovation, the challenge now is to sustain this momentum beyond the urgent event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Key reasons for continued [[innovation strategies | innovation]] include:

*   **Keeping Pace with Change** Governments, often characterized as slow-moving, need to be proactive rather than reactive in an environment of uncertainty, volatility, and ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Building Trust** [[Innovative responses to Covid19 by governments | Innovation]] can foster stronger relationships between governments and citizens by designing and delivering services that genuinely meet citizen needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Exploring Uncertainty** The [[covid19 recovery strategies | COVID-19 crisis]] caught many off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. [[Resilience and innovation in pandemic response | Innovation]] helps governments explore potential futures and steer towards preferred outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Improving Public Value** Ultimately, [[public sector innovation during Covid19 | innovation]] serves to enhance public services and the lives of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Challenges to Innovation in Public Sector Recovery

Despite the recognized benefits, significant barriers hinder [[innovation strategies | innovation]] within the public sector, particularly during recovery phases:

*   **Lack of Vision and Leadership** A primary challenge for delivering better public services in the [[covid19 recovery strategies | COVID-19 recovery]] phase is the absence of clear vision and leadership to move beyond traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Change** Many public managers are willing to acknowledge lessons learned from the crisis but are not as willing to change behaviors or take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This "magnetism of business as usual" is a significant hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.
*   **Mindset and Fear** The biggest barrier is often mindset, including a lack of openness to new ideas and a fear of losing control or being seen as incompetent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.
*   **Hierarchical Approaches** Strict hierarchies can stifle the potential and knowledge of employees, making it difficult to implement new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Regulation** Procurement rules and existing regulations are frequently cited as obstacles to experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. However, some rules are self-imposed or perceived, rather than actual legal barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Financial and Political Support** Leaders often demand quick results but may not provide the necessary long-term financial or political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
*   **Mobility in Public Service** High staff mobility can make it challenging to invest in and sustain [[innovation strategies | innovation]] networks and agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

## Understanding Innovation: OPSI Framework

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) defines innovation by three pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>:
1.  **Novelty:** Something new to the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
2.  **Implementation:** It must be put into action; it's not just an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
3.  **Impact:** It should have a positive impact or shift public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

OPSI also categorizes [[innovation strategies | innovation activities]] into four "facets" or types of [[innovation strategies | innovation]]:

*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>
    *   Characterized by "quick wins" and doing things better, such as shifting to e-signatures or digital procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
    *   Can also involve systemic improvement of a service, like Estonia's proactive family benefit system, which automatically offers services to new parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.
    *   This type of innovation is prevalent in Denmark, with 8 out of 10 public sector workplaces implementing an innovation within the last two years, mostly related to core functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Innovation**
    *   Common during the [[covid19 recovery strategies | COVID-19 crisis]], it involves adjusting to changing circumstances, such as forced telework or adapting communication strategies to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.
    *   Japan's agile governance model is an example, constantly analyzing changing conditions and risks to set new goals and develop systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. This continuous cycle allows for adapting service delivery based on new contexts, demographics, or media consumption habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation**
    *   Focuses on addressing difficult, complex societal challenges, often centered around issues like climate change (e.g., climate-neutral cities, healthy oceans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.
    *   Involves a broad range of stakeholders (researchers, academia, private sector, civil society) collectively defining problems, developing solutions, and implementing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
    *   Requires comprehensive coordination, collaborative mechanisms, collective long-term visions, institutional infrastructure, and supportive funding/regulatory environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>.
    *   [[Government innovation during COVID19 | COVID-19]] offers an opportunity to define new missions to prevent future global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Innovation**
    *   An emerging field focused on engaging with uncertainty and "working with the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.
    *   Aims to create evidence about potential futures to inform present decision-making, using tools like strategic foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>.
    *   Example: A report with the Government of Slovenia imagined four different future worlds (e.g., highly mobile elite, localized world, greater polarization, intergenerational interaction) to understand implications for the public sector of the future, particularly regarding aging and talent management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>. This helps make policy decisions now to prepare for possible futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>.

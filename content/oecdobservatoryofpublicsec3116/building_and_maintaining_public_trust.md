## Introduction to Trust in Governance
Building and [[building_public_trust_in_institutions | maintaining public trust]] is a critical component of effective governance, particularly in times of crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for governments to foster trust to ensure public cooperation with measures and to support societal resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Norway, a society with an already high level of trust, found this to be a significant asset in its response to the pandemic, leading to a public willingness to adhere to government advice and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Pillars of Trust in Crisis Management

### Communication
[[Effective communication and citizen trust in crisis | Communication is key to building trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Strategies employed by the Norwegian government include:
*   **Frequent Press Conferences** Central government held press conferences several times a week when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Targeted Communication** Special press conferences were held for children, with the Prime Minister and other ministers answering their questions digitally, demonstrating an effort to reach all parts of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Direct Public Engagement** "People's question time" on platforms like Facebook allowed the Prime Minister and other ministers to answer questions directly from the public, proving to be a huge success in [[building_public_trust_in_institutions | building trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Reaching Diverse Communities** Efforts were made to reach immigrant communities who might not follow mainstream Norwegian news by working closely with religious leaders to convey guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Transparency
[[Trust and transparency in public governance | Transparency]] is another crucial element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This includes being open about:
*   Reasons for implementing measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   What is known for sure about the measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Areas of uncertainty or where measures might not work as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   The balanced approach taken when health advice is disregarded due to other considerations, such as economic implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Coordination
Effective coordination is vital in national response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This involves:
*   **Cross-Government Collaboration** Regular meetings with County Governors and municipalities across the country, often involving multiple ministers from the national government, ensure coordination across different sectors affected by a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **National and Local Balance** While national guidelines and requirements provide a unified approach, it's crucial for local governments (municipalities) to have the authority and means to adapt measures to local circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Overly harsh or insufficient restrictions relative to the local situation can erode public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Collaboration with Experts** Close contact and joint press conferences with health authorities and professionals ensure that decisions are based on scientific advice, further enhancing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Breaking Silos** The crisis has accelerated the need for governments to coordinate efforts more closely across directorates and traditional silos, a lesson applicable beyond immediate crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Addressing Vulnerable Groups and Inequalities
A key focus during the crisis has been to safeguard vulnerable children and ensure that those struggling before the crisis do not struggle even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This includes providing targeted support to municipalities to follow up with vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Maintaining focus on the [[sustainable_development_goals | Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)]], particularly addressing inequalities, is essential as a long-term approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

## Innovation and Adaptability
The crisis has thrust innovation upon governments, demonstrating that things can be done differently under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Digitalization of Services** The explosion of online consultations with health services, which were previously underutilized, is a positive change expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Addressing Legal Barriers** The crisis highlighted existing laws requiring physical meetings or signatures, prompting a rapid review to make legal frameworks technology-neutral and AI-ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## The Role of Institutions and Leadership
[[The role of trust and leadership in public service | Trust in government institutions]] is more important than trust in individual politicians, as institutions remain while politicians come and go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. Norway's success in maintaining trust stems from:
*   **Open Society** Norway is an open society where politicians are very accessible, striving to minimize the perceived difference between politicians and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Culture of Innovation** A culture that encourages thinking outside the box, challenging existing methods, allowing new ideas, and to some extent, accepting failure (while being mindful of taxpayer money) is vital for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **Competence and Collaboration** Leaders must inspire innovation, and there needs to be competence to follow through. Cooperation between municipal and national levels is crucial, especially for smaller municipalities lacking specific expertise, to facilitate advancements and seamless services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. The public cares about receiving good quality service seamlessly, regardless of which governmental level provides it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## Long-Term Perspective
[[Impact of crisis on public trust and governance | Crises accelerate existing trends]] and provide lessons for future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The focus should be on:
*   **Avoiding Exacerbated Inequalities** A major concern is coming out of the crisis with worsened societal inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **Preserving Social Fabric** [[Public trust and governance | Trust]], which is "built in millimeters and torn down in kilometers," must be actively preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Collective Action** Tackling major challenges like climate change and growing global inequalities requires governments, the private sector, and society to come together, cooperate, and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. The feeling of being "all in the same boat" fostered by the crisis may help solve other significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

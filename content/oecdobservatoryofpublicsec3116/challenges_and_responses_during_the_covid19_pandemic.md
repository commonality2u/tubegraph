The International Conference on Governments Beyond Recovery and Towards the Future Fit Public Sector, co-hosted by the Slovenian Presidency of the EU, the OECD Observatory for Public Sector [[Leadership and Innovation during COVID19|Innovation]], and the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA), focused on exploring opportunities for public governance as the world emerges from the [[Impacts and vulnerabilities revealed by Covid19|COVID-19]] crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Key themes included [[Leadership and Innovation during COVID19|innovation]], adaptation, strategic foresight, and co-creation for a better future for governments, societies, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Government Challenges and Responses

The [[Challenges faced by governments during the pandemic|COVID-19 pandemic]] presented significant [[Challenges faced by governments in the Covid19 crisis|challenges]] to governments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Governments provided crucial, bold, and decisive [[Government response to COVID19|responses]] to support businesses, households, and save lives and livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This support included massively increased spending on healthcare and income support, representing a significant 27% of GDP across OECD countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

### Economic Recovery and Ongoing Risks
The economic recovery is currently underway, with global growth projected to reach 5.7% in the current year and 4.5% next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This optimism is attributed to extensive policy support, rapid vaccine development, and accelerating digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. However, the recovery remains uneven across countries and sectors, with new virus outbreaks posing the biggest risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. An all-out effort is needed to vaccinate the entire world population quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

### Future Priorities for Governance
Looking ahead, immediate and medium-to-longer term priorities for governments include:
*   **Optimizing Recovery Quality** Policy support should remain flexible and targeted towards those in genuine need, with a focus on future-oriented investments, particularly in green and digital transitions and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Open markets and a competitive framework are essential for job creation and living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Recovery policies must also promote equality of opportunities and social mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **Addressing Climate Change** More ambitious and globally coordinated action is needed to transition to net-zero emissions by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. This requires better data on policy effort and impact, and a coherent approach to emissions pricing that is both effective and fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. The aim is to reduce global emissions without shifting them elsewhere and ensure every country carries a fair, appropriate, and verifiable share of the burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
*   **Managing Digital Transformation** Governments must seize opportunities while managing risks associated with digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This includes ensuring equitable access to digital infrastructure, investing in skills development, planning for the future of work, addressing competition issues, and setting standards for artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Public Sectors** Public sectors need to strategically embed [[Leadership and Innovation during COVID19|innovation]] and foresight into policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from the Pandemic

The [[Government response strategies to Covid19|government response strategies to COVID-19]] highlighted strengths and weaknesses in public sectors.

### Preparation and Flexibility
The pandemic underscored the importance of preparedness and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Some countries, like Slovenia, were not adequately prepared despite prior recommendations from organizations like the World Health Organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. This led to struggles with coordinating responses, managing empty stocks of personal protective equipment, and healthcare system pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

### European Coordination
Initial European-level coordination was lacking, with new borders and chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. However, subsequent phases showed improved coordination, leading to successful recovery efforts and financial support for vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

### Democracy vs. Autocracy in Crisis Response
A dilemma arose between flexible systems (e.g., those allowing presidents or governments to take immediate measures) and democratic systems requiring parliamentary approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. While more authoritarian systems might have been faster initially, [[Leadership and Innovation during COVID19|innovation]] for effective vaccines primarily came from countries with free markets, freedom, and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. The pandemic calls for democracies to become more resilient to such [[Challenges faced by governments in the Covid19 crisis|challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

### The Role of Digital Transformation
Digital transformation can significantly aid crisis response, enabling better data collection and more targeted, timely, and adequate responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. The lack of integrated data across the EU and OECD hindered early response efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

### Trust in Science and Government
A surprising revelation during the pandemic was the clear division in trust in science across Europe, with higher trust in Western Europe compared to Central and Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. This lack of trust poses a problem for implementing science-based decisions, particularly for [[Government response strategies to Covid19|climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. Public confidence in government's ability to face complex challenges is balanced, highlighting the need for governments to instill more trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

## Adapting to Future Challenges

The pandemic serves as a call for greater awareness and preparedness for future challenges, which could be more serious or even combine, such as a pandemic with a serious cyberattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

### Comparing COVID-19 to Climate Change
The [[Impacts and vulnerabilities revealed by Covid19|COVID-19]] crisis was sharp and urgent, requiring quick government responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Climate change, however, is a long-term crisis with less immediate visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.
*   **Urgent Crises:** Require quick reactions, strong management, and [[Leadership and Innovation during COVID19|leadership]] to quickly reorganize and find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Crises:** Require strategic foresight, long-term planning, and understanding how technologies will develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. Both types of crises demand similar core skills like adaptable thinking, change management, and resource integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### Global Cooperation and Innovation
[[Challenges and opportunities faced by cities due to COVID19|Climate change]] necessitates global-level solutions, not just local or national <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. [[Leadership and Innovation during COVID19|Innovation]] in clean energy production is the biggest solution, requiring substantial investment in technologies like post-lithium batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. The European Union aims to be a leader in this, setting ambitious goals for CO2 neutrality by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. International cooperation, such as through the UN or G20, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.

### Private Sector Influence on Public Administration
Insights from the private sector can benefit public administration, particularly in fostering [[Leadership and Innovation during COVID19|innovation]] and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>:
*   **Empowering People:** Public administration often relies on established procedures, but adopting the private sector's approach of empowering individuals to improve things is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>.
*   **Recruitment and Evaluation:** Recruitment should focus on problem-solving abilities and adaptability rather than just rote knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. Opening up public sector positions to private sector candidates and recognizing their experience would also be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.
*   **Collaboration:** Lowering barriers between the private and public sectors for greater collaboration would benefit both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

## Fostering a Future-Ready Public Sector

To better prepare for future [[Challenges faced by governments in the Covid19 crisis|challenges]], societies need to be more "[[Leadership and Innovation during COVID19|innovation]] friendly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>. This involves:
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** While Europe has a vast treasure of good practices within its countries, this knowledge is not exploited enough due to a lack of flexibility and bureaucratic obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>.
*   **Education:** Teaching citizens from a young age how to use information, judge it, and prioritize it is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>.
*   **Cooperation:** Greater cooperation between European Union countries is needed, moving from one-on-one advice to bringing people together to share knowledge and learn faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>. Initiatives like the Common Assessment Framework (CAF) and the European Public Sector Award aim to facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.

The goal is to ensure that learnings from the [[Challenges and opportunities faced by cities due to COVID19|COVID-19]] crisis lead to a proactive approach, preparing for future challenges while maintaining a mindset of continuous adaptation and [[Leadership and Innovation during COVID19|innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>.

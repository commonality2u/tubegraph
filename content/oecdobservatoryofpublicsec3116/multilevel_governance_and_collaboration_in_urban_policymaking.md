Cities worldwide were profoundly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, finding themselves on the front lines of the response. They were instrumental not only in containing the virus's spread by implementing measures like lockdowns and physical distancing but also in coordinating and prioritizing the well-being of their residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This involved ensuring the continuity of essential public services such as water, sanitation, solid waste, and transport, as well as protecting vulnerable groups and supporting local businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Beyond immediate crisis management, cities have been leading efforts in constructing and contributing to recovery packages, focusing on digitalization, the green transition, and a renewed social contract based on trust and public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## The Role of Innovation in Crisis and Recovery

The crisis, while not revealing many new structural inequalities, accelerated existing trends and acted as a magnifying glass, urging local leaders to intensify their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. A key difference from past pandemics is the unprecedented role of innovation and digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Massive investments in digital infrastructure enabled a "digital proximity" through online education, telemedicine, e-commerce, and particularly telework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This highlights that innovation extends beyond technology to include better local public policies, planning, investment strategies, and systemic thinking at the local level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Multilevel Governance

Effective urban policymaking, especially during crises, necessitates robust [[collaborative_governance_and_breaking_silos_in_mission_implementation | collaborative governance]] and strong coordination across different levels of government.

### Data Sharing and Fragmentation
In complex administrative structures like London, with 33 boroughs, issues like COVID-19 do not respect administrative boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. While boroughs are adept at using their own data, a coordinated approach is hindered by a fragmented data landscape. For example, knowing if a child receives free school meals in a different borough than where they live is crucial for identifying vulnerability but requires complex data-sharing agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. A "spiders web" approach involving 528 different data-sharing relationships between 33 boroughs is impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Fixing these basic data issues is crucial for effective crisis response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### National vs. Local Coordination
There have been instances where national governments initiate well-intentioned programs, such as providing free laptops or national volunteer databases, without adequate engagement or co-design with city governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. This lack of consultation leads to wasted time and energy, as local realities are often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis has been an eye-opener regarding these coordination failures, emphasizing the need for cities, which possess granular knowledge of their communities, to be at the heart of policy design and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. A partnership approach, with dialogue flowing in both directions, is essential for designing effective solutions for urgent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

### Fear of Failure and Organisational Culture
A significant challenge to innovation in large organizations, including city governments, is the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Organizations often build structures and cultures that discourage risk-taking and trying new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. To counter this, cities like Helsingborg in Sweden are actively tackling the fear of failure through:
*   **Structure:** Creating easily navigable systems for employees to test and develop ideas with coaching support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
*   **Culture:** Encouraging open discussion about mistakes, promoting collective learning from failures, and even instituting an "internal award for the fail of the year" to signal that mistakes are not only accepted but expected for true innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.
*   **Capabilities:** Training managers in leadership skills for change, transformation, and innovation to empower them to lead change effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

### Political Imagination and Societal Vision
Innovation is not just about technology; it's about political imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. This involves defining the kind of societies cities want to become and fostering [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | participatory practices]] beyond specific projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. Mexico City, for example, appointed a "chief creative officer" to head a team of urban scientists and humanities experts, working together to address challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. This approach considers cities as a "system of systems," promoting a symbiotic relationship where everyone affects each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

The crisis has also accelerated societal shifts, such as Portugal passing an immigration law to legalise illegal immigrants, acknowledging that the weakest link affects the whole community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Similarly, Mexico City is formally incorporating informal last-mile transportation solutions, recognizing citizens' ingenuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The recent passage of mobility as a human right in Mexico City's constitution, a world first, demonstrates how crises can accelerate long-standing activist agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

## Embracing Innovation as a "Must-Have"
Innovation, once considered a "nice-to-have," is increasingly recognized as a "must-have" for cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. The growth of Chief Innovation Officers in US cities from five in 2012 to over 80 today reflects a global trend in embedding innovation capacity within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. Despite constant budget constraints and being at the ground level of policy implementation, cities are realizing the value of dedicated innovation staff to step back from daily crises and strategically rethink service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. This helps break down silos and leverage existing services for better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

During the COVID-19 crisis, mayors and city managers with existing innovation capacities leveraged them for emergency response, developing solutions quickly when no playbook existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>. While budget shortfalls pose a challenge to maintaining these capacities, many cities are prioritizing innovation as essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.

### Measuring Impact and Shared Learning
For innovation to be sustained, it's crucial to measure its tangible outcomes and show its contribution to resident well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. Cities should start by understanding the problem through data, even granular data to avoid the "tyranny of averages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. However, objective data alone is insufficient; subjective data, reflecting the intangible infrastructure and cultural meaning that citizens attach to their cities, is equally vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. The goal is to optimize for public value, not just efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

Programs like those run by Bloomberg Philanthropies help cities build innovation capacity by providing tools, skill sets, and fostering a network for sharing [[collaborative_learning_and_innovation_in_government | lessons learned]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. This [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | city-to-city peer learning]] allows mayors to understand shared challenges and develop mitigation strategies, whether enforcing mandates or creating workarounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. Examples like a website created by one city to support black-owned businesses and provide masks were quickly replicated by others, demonstrating the power of sharing what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.

## The Future of Urban Life and Collaboration

The rise of teleworking, while offering benefits like reduced commutes and seamless virtual [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>, also poses challenges for cities. It raises questions about the future of office spaces, impacts on fiscal capacity, and exacerbates digital inclusion issues for those without access to devices, internet, or digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>.

The pandemic has also heightened awareness of environmental issues and spurred concepts like the "15-minute city" (Paris) or "20-minute city" (Melbourne), aiming to rethink planning and public space around accessibility rather than mere mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. The shift from mobility to accessibility and the emphasis on green amenities appear to be irreversible trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

Ultimately, the future requires a balance between data-driven strategies and open-ended, creative exploration that acknowledges the non-linear and often non-rational nature of societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. As cities navigate the post-pandemic era, fostering political imagination, fortifying public institutions, and building an infrastructure for [[collaboration_and_governance_in_digital_services | collaboration]] will be essential for building more resilient, equitable, and adaptable urban environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

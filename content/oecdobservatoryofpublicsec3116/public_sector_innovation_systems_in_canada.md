The Canadian Public Service has been the subject of a recent report exploring its [[public sector innovation]] systems and the lessons learned from this work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This initiative, commissioned by the Impact and Innovation Unit, aimed to better understand the federal public service's innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Historical Context and Need for Systemic Innovation
Canada has a long history of interest and an articulated ambition for innovation within its public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Despite this, there has been an ongoing struggle to balance appropriate controls with allowing for change and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, largely because innovation is inherently difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

While [[public sector innovation]] has occurred, it has often been ad-hoc, reactive, and opportunistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Modern times, characterized by continuous change, demand that innovation be a consistent, deliberate, and reliable resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Governments must adapt to evolving economies and societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Innovation is not a spectator sport; it requires hands-on experience and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. A government that fails to innovate risks consistently lagging behind and disappointing citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Therefore, innovation needs to be a core competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, systemic, repeatable, and consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. To achieve this, understanding the underlying innovation system is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Understanding the Innovation System
A "system" comprises the elements that define expectations without explicit instruction, including understanding of appetite, standards, processes, and protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. An "innovation system" encompasses the factors, components, and practices that influence whether and to what extent innovation occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. An innovation system already exists; the goal is to be more deliberate about it to ensure innovation happens at the desired level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

To understand the existing system, it's essential to:
*   **Understand the past**: This includes deeply held beliefs about innovation, how they were shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, past learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, and existing achievements and building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Understand the lived experience**: This involves appreciating the realities and context of innovation, including what it feels like to innovate, what's encountered, and what works or doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Understand the present dynamics**: Recognizing the continuous new developments in the innovation space and how current activities might play out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

The study employed a design-led process to understand the lived experience and people's beliefs about what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This process involved deep dives and testing preliminary findings, leading to 28 initial observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

### Core Understandings about Canada's Innovation System
These preliminary findings coalesced into four core understandings regarding the [[public sector innovation]] system in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>:

1.  **Uncertain Relationship**: While attention to innovation has increased, the public service's relationship with it remains unsure, with ambiguity about its role, place, and who is expected to do what <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
2.  **Byproduct, Not Merit-Based**: Innovation often happens as a byproduct of other processes or individual determination, rather than based on the quality of an idea or the underlying need for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
3.  **Mismatch with Context**: Despite ongoing changes, there's a mismatch between what can be done inside and outside government, risking a public service unsuited to its context and leading to citizen disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
4.  **Marginal Activity**: The practice of innovation has evolved but largely remains a marginal activity, not viewed as core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Determinants of Innovation
These understandings informed a model identifying factors that shape innovation, analyzed at three levels: individual, organization, and system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. If system elements are not in place, innovation falls to the organizational level, leading to siloed perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. If organizational elements are missing, it falls to individuals, requiring exceptional effort and making innovation unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. The goal is to make innovation easier and more systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

The model identifies four key determinants:

### 1. Clarity
*   **Definition**: There must be a clear signal at the system level about why innovation is wanted and needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
*   **Private vs. Public Sector**: In the private sector, profit provides a strong, clear signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. In the public sector, the signal is politics, which is changeable, noisy, and often competing with other agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Action Areas**:
    *   **Shared Understanding**: Do actors understand what innovation means? Denmark's innovation barometer builds shared understanding and agreed definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. In Canada, views diverge, though the Declaration on [[public sector innovation]] is a start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
    *   **Relation to Priorities**: Do actors understand innovation in relation to other priorities? France's manifesto on [[public sector innovation]] sets clear expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. Canada's declaration and Impact Canada initiative demonstrate the link, but wider dissemination is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.
    *   **Roles**: Do actors understand their roles in the innovation system? Denmark uses eight innovation archetypes to help people understand their participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. Canadian innovation labs offer hands-on experience, improving role understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
    *   **Shared History**: Do actors see how innovation fits with shared history and context? Denmark changed the narrative of the public servant's role from traditional to collaborator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. In Canada, efforts to illustrate innovation's long-standing presence in the public service journey are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.
*   **Prompting Question**: Do external system actors have a clear sense of what the public service means by innovation, where it's seeking it, and how they can contribute, indicating a consistent internal story? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. In the Canadian context, clarity is observed as a keystone element due to a strong demand for understanding mandates and permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

### 2. Parity
*   **Definition**: Innovation must have equal standing with other considerations when proposing actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   **Private vs. Public Sector**: The private sector has a marketplace for ideas where good ideas are considered, partly due to the threat of competition if not pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. In the public sector, new ideas often go up against incumbent forces with no competition threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   **Action Areas**: Process openness, circumventing bottlenecks, finding allies for innovations, and navigating risk and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

### 3. Suitability
*   **Definition**: Capability systems and infrastructure must be appropriate and sufficient for available innovative options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
*   **Private vs. Public Sector**: In the private sector, investment in emergent opportunities occurs due to strong feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. In the public sector, feedback loops favor what is already understood, leading to a "taker" rather than "shaper" role if waiting until something is fully comprehended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   **Action Areas**: Learning from and keeping pace with external change, socializing technology within the public service, exposing leaders to new technologies, exploring new operational models (e.g., Canada's Talent Cloud for HR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>, and tracking changing expectations from citizens and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

### 4. Normality
*   **Definition**: Innovation is seen as integral, not an occasionally accepted deviation from the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **Private vs. Public Sector**: In the private sector, if something makes money, it becomes accepted and normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. In the public sector, innovation is often seen as an exception or "frolic," making it hard to embed into core workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Action Areas**: Establishing clear behaviors supporting innovation, linking innovation to regular business, socializing and celebrating it, and upholding and defending it when challenges arise (as experiments can fail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

These determinants are interdependent; a weakness in one area can hinder others (e.g., lack of clarity makes parity difficult) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. A system performs only as strong as its weakest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

## Dynamic System and Future Scenarios
The [[public sector innovation]] system is dynamic and evolves over time, so a static snapshot is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. The report introduces three scenarios to play out possibilities and understand tensions and trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>:
*   **Zero Null Hypothesis**: Continuation of the current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **Scenario 1**: Increased attention and effort to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
*   **Scenario 2**: A radical shift with innovation at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.
These scenarios are not prescriptive but help assess whether existing efforts will achieve desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Directions
There are no simple answers to [[public sector innovation]]; the solutions depend on where the system actors want to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. The goal of this work is to make the implicit explicit, providing a roadmap and levers for intervention rather than specific directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. This empowers individuals to see themselves as part of and contributors to shaping the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

The report offers suggested areas of opportunity for different actors, recognizing that a collective effort is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>. It also includes a speculative maturity model for innovation systems to provide a reference point for evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. Another outcome of this work, prompted by the Canadian experience, is the "innovation facets model," which grapples with the multi-faceted nature of [[public sector innovation]] and how different forms require different [[public sector innovation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.

Chad Hartnell from the Impact and Innovation Unit reflects that Canada's public service is highly professional with a long history of innovation, not starting from a deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. He emphasizes that there's no singular roadmap for innovation; it requires agility, nimbleness, and intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. Given the large size of the federal public service (over 260,000 employees), frustrations will arise when attempting system-wide changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>. Individuals have opportunities to innovate within their control, which can impact organizations and departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>. Chad also highlights that this work is inherently difficult, often requiring action without complete information, and facing "no" many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. The challenge is to transform "no" into a stronger proposal by addressing underlying concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

### Addressing Key Challenges in Canada
*   **Accountability and Transparency**: Measuring innovation's impact is challenging due to its unique nature and the need for new metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. There is a focus on results and delivery, shifting from activity-based initiatives to outcomes-based impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Transparency through open communication and publishing information is encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. This is an evergreen process, requiring proactive assessment and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.
*   **Risk-Averse Culture**: While risk aversion exists in the Canadian public service, it is a universal bureaucratic trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. The key is to balance it by increasing the perceived risk of *not* innovating and making that more tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>. Canada's commitment to experimentation, for example, helps by normalizing and expecting it, thereby reducing individual risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>. The FPT Declaration on [[public sector innovation]] (November 2016) provides tacit approval for public servants to explore and do things differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. Furthermore, focusing on outcome-based payments reduces risk, as payment occurs only if the desired result is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. Often, perceived risk stems from convention rather than foundational policy, which typically offers more flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   **Grassroots vs. Top-Down Innovation**: A balance is needed in large, complex, and changing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. While top-down mandates can drive experimentation, individual public servants often need to feel empowered and pursue their remit for change, recognizing that permission may already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.
*   **"Clay Layer" (Middle Management) and Central Agency**: Middle management acts as an essential filter in hierarchical organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>. To overcome this, forums should be created where people can circulate, share, and develop ideas to a sophisticated level before requiring managerial attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>. Platforms like GC Connects and GCcollab are examples of such forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>. Effective storytelling, tailored to the concerns of different management levels (e.g., risk, communication, policy), can also help proposals resonate and gain approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:54">[01:24:54]</a>.
*   **Disruptive Technologies**: Disruptive technologies like AI and blockchain will be major drivers of [[public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. In Canada, the Deputy Minister Task Force on [[public sector innovation]] is mandated to explore core systems transformation and experiment with these technologies to learn and adapt them into government operations for greater efficiency and risk savvy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. Examples include experimenting with blockchain for digital identity and AI for translation services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. Foundational pieces, like a robust data strategy (released recently), are crucial for informed utilization of disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.
*   **Applicability to Other Countries**: The framework used to assess Canada's innovation system is a valuable public good for other countries to assess their own systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>. While the specific nuances will differ across contexts, the four key pillars (Clarity, Parity, Suitability, Normality) and the understanding of fundamental drivers of innovation activity are constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>. This model is currently being tested in Brazil and shows resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:53">[01:28:53]</a>.

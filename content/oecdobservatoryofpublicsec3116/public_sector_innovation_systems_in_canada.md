A recent report, resulting from a year and a half of work with Canada's Impact and Innovation Unit, explores [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] systems, offering insights and lessons learned from the Canadian context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This collaborative exploration aimed to understand [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] within the federal public service, informing future decisions and opportunities for scaling efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Historical Context of Innovation in Canada

Canada is not new to the [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] narrative, possessing a long and clear history of interest in [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. There has been an articulated ambition for more [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], emphasized by various public service leaders over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. However, there has also been an ongoing struggle to balance appropriate controls with allowing for change and [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This is because [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is inherently challenging, and no government globally has yet mastered it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## The Need for Systemic [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]]

While governments have been innovating, it has often been an ad-hoc, reactive, and opportunistic activity rather than a consistent practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Current times necessitate [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] to be a consistent, deliberate, and reliable resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Reasons for this necessity include:
*   Governments must change in response to changing environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   In an evolving economy, governments need to adapt policy settings to maintain outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] requires active engagement and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   Public servants, citizens, and governments increasingly expect change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   A government that fails to innovate risks falling behind, perpetually reacting and disappointing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Therefore, [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] needs to become a core competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. It may not always be the sole or correct solution, but it must be a consistently considered option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. To achieve this, [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] must be systemic, repeatable, and consistent, rather than a reactive occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Understanding an [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] System

A system encompasses all the implicit elements that guide behaviour, ensuring those within it understand what is expected without explicit instruction, such as common appetites, standards, processes, and protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. An [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] system specifically refers to the factors, components, and practices that influence the occurrence and extent of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Such a system already exists; the goal is to make it more deliberate and explicit to achieve desired levels of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

To understand the existing system, it's crucial to examine:
*   **The Past:** Understand existing beliefs about [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and how they were shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Build upon prior learning and achievements rather than repeating efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Lived Experience:** Appreciate the realities and context of innovating within different environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Present:** Grasp the current activities and evolving nature of the [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## Methodology of the Study

The study employed a design-led process to deeply understand the lived experience of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and the beliefs within the Canadian public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Initial assumptions were challenged, leading to 28 preliminary findings which were then tested and validated with Canadian civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. These findings were grouped into four clusters:

1.  **Fragmented Understanding:** A lack of clear understanding around the "who, what, and why" of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], leading rational individuals to prioritize clearer, more easily tracked agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
2.  **Reliance on Individuals:** While [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] occurs, its success often depends on specific individuals in opportune circumstances ("right person, right place, right time") rather than merit or opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
3.  **Unprepared for Opportunities:** The public service's feedback loops favour clearly understood options, making it difficult to leverage emergent innovative possibilities when demand shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
4.  **Marginal Activity:** [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] is often a "side-of-desk" activity, not integrated into core practices, making it hard to become routine in a system traditionally focused on standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

From these, four core understandings of Canada's [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] system emerged:
1.  **Uncertain Relationship:** Despite increased attention, the public service remains uncertain about its relationship with [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], including its role, place, and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
2.  **Byproduct of Agendas/Individuals:** [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] is largely a byproduct of other processes or individual determination, rather than stemming from the merit of ideas or underlying need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
3.  **Mismatched to Context:** A gap exists between what is possible inside and outside government, risking a public service unsuited to its context and leading to citizen disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
4.  **Marginalized Practice:** The practice of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] has evolved but remains marginal, not viewed as core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Determinants of [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]]

These understandings helped develop a model identifying factors that shape how and whether [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. The model uses three levels of analysis: individual, organizational, and system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. If higher levels are weak, the burden falls to the lower levels, making [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] reliant on individual exceptional effort, which is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

Four determinants of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] were identified, and contrasted with the private sector to highlight structural forces:

### 1. Clarity
*   **Definition:** Is a clear signal sent to system actors about [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and its fit with other priorities? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>
*   **Private Sector:** Strong, clear signal through profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** Signal is politics, which is changeable, noisy, and often multi-faceted, causing [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] to come second to clearer agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Action Areas:** Ensure actors understand [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]'s meaning (e.g., Denmark's innovation barometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>), its relation to other priorities (e.g., France's manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>), their roles in the system (e.g., Denmark's innovation archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>), and how it fits the shared history and context (e.g., Denmark's narrative shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>).
*   **Canadian Context:** The Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] is a good start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>. [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] labs help provide hands-on experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. There's a strong demand for understanding mandates and permission in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

### 2. Parity
*   **Definition:** Does [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] have equal standing with other considerations for proposed actions? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>
*   **Private Sector:** A marketplace for ideas where ideas are seriously considered due to competitive threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** New ideas face incumbent forces with little competitive threat, requiring specific needs or opportunities to push them through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   **Action Areas:** Processes should be open to challenge, bottlenecks can be circumvented, allies found, and risk/uncertainty navigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

### 3. Suitability
*   **Definition:** Are the capability systems and infrastructure appropriate and sufficient for available innovative options? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>
*   **Private Sector:** Strong feedback loops drive investment in emergent ideas, and successful concepts are scaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** Feedback loops favor understood options. Waiting for understanding means governments become "takers" rather than "shapers" (e.g., with IT), losing absorptive capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Action Areas:** System parts should learn from and keep pace with external change, pushing the [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. Leaders need exposure to new technologies and operational models (e.g., Canada's Talent Cloud for HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>). The public service must track changing expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

### 4. Normality
*   **Definition:** Is [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] seen as integral rather than an occasional deviation from the norm? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>
*   **Private Sector:** If something generates profit, it becomes accepted and normal, regardless of its perceived "stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] is often seen as exceptional or a "frolic," making it difficult to embed into routine government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Action Areas:** Foster clear behaviours supporting [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], link it to regular business, socialize and celebrate successes, and defend [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] practices when experiments fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

These determinants are interdependent; weakness in one area impacts others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. A system's performance is limited by its weakest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. While the public sector cannot become like the private sector, these points offer ways to strengthen the signal around [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

## Scenarios for Future Evolution

The report introduces three speculative scenarios to illustrate tensions and trade-offs in the evolution of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>:
1.  **Zero Null Hypothesis:** A continuation of current activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
2.  **Increased Attention:** What happens with greater focus and effort on [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
3.  **Radical Shift:** [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] placed at the center of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.
These scenarios are not prescriptive but help assess whether existing efforts will meet desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Reflections

Reflections from Chad Hartnell of the Impact and Innovation Unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>:
*   **Pride in the Public Service:** The Canadian public service has a long history of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and is highly professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
*   **No Singular Roadmap:** There is no single path or series of steps to achieve [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] within government; it requires agility, nimbleness, and intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.
*   **Size and Magnitude:** The federal public service is a massive organization (over 260,000 employees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>. While individual and organizational efforts matter, understanding one's role within the larger system is crucial for advancing [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.
*   **Hard Work and Resilience:** [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] is difficult. It often involves building and implementing decisions without complete information, and encountering frequent rejections ("no") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. The challenge is to learn from these rejections and transform them into stronger proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges in the Canadian Context

### Measurement of [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]]
Measuring [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is inherently challenging because it involves doing new things without established standards or performance targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. The Canadian government's results and delivery agenda focuses on achieving outcomes rather than merely cataloguing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. It is crucial to shift focus from activity-based initiatives to outcome-based impact, working openly by default, and continuously assessing data to adapt plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. Paying only when outcomes are achieved presents a better risk profile for the public policy and taxpayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.

### Risk Aversion
While risk aversion exists in the Canadian public service, it is a universal characteristic of bureaucratic organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. The key is not to eliminate risk aversion but to balance it by making the risks of *not* innovating more tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. Canada's experimentation direction and commitment provide a structural force that normalizes and de-risks experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>. The FPT Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] offers broad approval for public servants to explore and do things differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. Additionally, framing initiatives around outcomes rather than activities can shift the perception of risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. Often, the system operates by convention rather than foundational policies, which may offer more flexibility than commonly assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

### The "Clay Layer" (Middle Management)
Frustration with middle management is common in hierarchical organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>. To overcome this, it's essential to create forums where ideas can be circulated, shared, and developed to a more sophisticated level before requiring direct management attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>. Platforms like GC Connects and GCcollab are valuable for finding allies and refining ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>. Effective storytelling, tailored to the concerns of different audiences (e.g., risk, communication, policy), is also crucial for gaining buy-in from middle management and senior leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

### Response to Disruptive Change
Canada has a Deputy Minister Task Force on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] mandated to explore core systems transformation (e.g., HR, procurement) and experiment with disruptive technologies like AI and blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. Examples include experimenting with blockchain for digital identity management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a> and AI for translation services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. Foundational elements, such as a strong data strategy, are crucial for effectively utilizing these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.

## Applicability to Other Countries

The framework used to assess Canada's [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] system is a valuable starting point for other countries to assess their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>. While the specific details may shift contextually, the core pillars of the framework are likely to remain applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. The Canadian study's focus on understanding fundamental drivers of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] activity offers insights that resonate in diverse contexts, such as Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:53">[01:28:53]</a>.

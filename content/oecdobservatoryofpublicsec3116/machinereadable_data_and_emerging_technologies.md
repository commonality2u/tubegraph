The "Machine-readable world" is a significant trend in public sector innovation, representing a maturing approach to digital government. It combines prior efforts in opening government data with growing interest in [[managing_emerging_technologies_and_societal_impacts | emerging technologies]] like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

## Key Aspects of the Machine-readable World

Governments have gained substantial experience in publishing data as machine-readable products, recognizing their power to fuel innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic development through new businesses and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. Examples include weather data and GPS information, which form the basis for many modern apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>.

A core aspect of this trend is the reformatting of existing inputs and information dissemination methods into machine-readable and machine-consumable formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. This allows data to feed into algorithms and [[managing_emerging_technologies_and_societal_impacts | emerging technologies]], building the necessary infrastructure for future advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

### Key Applications and Examples

*   **Converting Laws and Policies into Machine-Readable Formats:** This involves transforming legislative rules into code that can trigger automatic changes, ensuring the intent of laws aligns with their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
    *   **Better Rules (New Zealand):** This initiative converts laws and policies into machine-readable formats. Traditionally, legislation is drafted for human reading, leading to inconsistencies, interpretation difficulties, and challenges in making changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. The "Better Rules" approach works with software developers to translate rules into clear, precise programmatic terms, using consistent definitions that reflect legislative intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. This allows for instantaneous application of rules by computers across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
        *   **Case Studies:** The Rates Rebate Act (designed to lower home costs for low-income individuals) and the Holidays Act (guaranteeing four weeks of annual holiday) were applied in this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
        *   **Benefits:** This shortens feedback loops between legislative intent and implementation, provides a clear and authoritative source, and lays a foundation for future applications, potentially allowing computers to contribute to legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.
*   **Machine Learning for Land Mapping (Queensland, Australia):** Manual processes involving surveyors for land mapping, crucial for disaster management and land use, are being replaced by satellite imagery and machine learning. This converts land features into machine-readable and consumable data for various technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
*   **Piloting [[ethical_considerations_and_blockchain_in_emerging_technologies | Emerging Technologies]] for Mission-Driven Projects:** Governments are conducting initial pilots of [[ethical_considerations_and_blockchain_in_emerging_technologies | emerging technologies]] to solve significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
    *   **Blockchain and AI for Counterfeit Medicines (Mongolia):** In Mongolia, where 40% of medicines are fake, causing thousands of injuries and deaths annually, a pilot project combines blockchain and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. Blockchain creates an immutable record of every transaction and change of hands for medicine, while AI detects anomalous readings or unauthorized entries before they reach the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations and Government's Role

As [[managing_emerging_technologies_and_societal_impacts | emerging technologies]] become more prevalent, it is crucial for governments to integrate [[ethical_considerations_and_blockchain_in_emerging_technologies | ethical considerations]] throughout the development and implementation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. A cautionary example is China's Social Credit system, which converts human decisions and characteristics into data fed into algorithms to generate social credit scores, leading to real-world implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. This highlights the need for governments to consider [[ethical_considerations_and_blockchain_in_emerging_technologies | ethical frameworks]] to ensure a positive role in pursuing these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

The role of government in relation to [[managing_emerging_technologies_and_societal_impacts | emerging technologies]] is still evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. While the specific role may vary, it may shift from providing direct services to offering safeguards and assurances for decentralized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Governments need to engage with these technologies during their nascent stages to better understand their potential impact and make educated decisions, rather than reacting only after problems arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. Hands-on experience and knowledge are vital for effective procurement and requirements development in this evolving landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.

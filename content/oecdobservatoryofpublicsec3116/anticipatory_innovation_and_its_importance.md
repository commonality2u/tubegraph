[[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] involves engaging with the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It is considered one of the most uncertain areas of innovation because the future is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Why Governments Need to Engage

Governments must engage with future possibilities, even those not yet a reality, because once innovations occur and dominant designs emerge, it becomes very difficult to change them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

For instance, the decision on which side of the road cars drive was an innovation that locked in many mobility systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, affecting infrastructure and driving practices for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Similarly, current technological and non-technological choices will become dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

> [!INFO] Importance of Proactivity
> Governments need to be proactive and "ahead of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. While it's not always possible to know exactly what will happen, governments should analyze and consider a variety of possible futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This foresight allows them to influence emerging dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Contemporary Examples

Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is crucial for AI to anticipate different solutions, both technological and ethical, and to shape these innovations as they emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Questions regarding ethical boundaries for AI or the adoption of blockchain solutions can be influenced now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. However, this influence will likely not be possible in ten or fifteen years when these technologies are widespread and deeply embedded in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

To ensure what is best for their people and countries, governments must anticipate future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

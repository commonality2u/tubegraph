The future is largely unpredictable, with the world changing at a rapid pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. To effectively navigate this future, it is crucial to understand the sources of disruption and the direction the world is heading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The public sector must adapt to this "new normal" where what was once special, like large online events, is now commonplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Need for [[Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector | Public Sector Agility]]

Citizens today expect excellent services from the public sector, mirroring the customer-focused, efficient, and technologically enabled experiences provided by the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. To meet these expectations, the public sector must [[Anticipatory Innovation | innovate]] and transform its operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Key aspects of this transformation include:
*   Formalizing agile working practices, such as remote working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Collaborating outside the traditional government ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   Exchanging good practices with other governments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   Utilizing data and analytics for evidence-based policymaking and finding innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Co-creating services directly with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

An agile public sector organization should be flexible to adapt to citizens' needs, flatter in structure, team-based, and aligned with its strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This means a focus on people, ensuring the right talent is in the right places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, strategic workforce planning, and recruiting innovative and collaborative civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Redesigning jobs and processes is also vital for greater efficiency and innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Cultivating Future-Oriented Capabilities

Continuously upskilling and reskilling civil servants is crucial, as skills must keep pace with new technologies and complex societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Future-important skills include critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and the ability to anticipate future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The most critical skill, however, will be the ability to continuously learn and adapt, transforming public administration into a "learning organization" capable of learning from the past and anticipating the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that public administration can be agile and responsive, adapting quickly to new ways of working and communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This moment should be used to amplify agility and innovation within government structures and work processes to create a "better normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Challenges to Transformation

Despite the value of design thinking, [[systems_thinking_and_anticipatory_innovation_governance | systems thinking]], and innovation labs, public sector organizations inherently seek stability and are bureaucratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Governments are built for predictability, stability, risk management, and ensuring quality services on a large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. While these traits are necessary, they create strong forces resisting a radically different public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This requires a continuous, proactive push for innovation and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Without this constant effort, governments risk lapsing back into old ways and failing to meet societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

### Driving Change Versus Being Driven

The public sector faces the fundamental question of whether it drives change or is merely driven by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. It is not simply at the mercy of digitalization but can be an active participant in digital and broader societal transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Governments are major funders of basic research and significant spenders, possessing substantial means to steer and shift change productively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

The future is not a singular path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Technology, for instance, allows for different scenarios:
*   Highly centralized control and algorithmic governance with predictive traits, leading to flatter organizations with concentrated decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   Hyper-personalization and distribution, enabling personalized experiences and interactions with citizens from a bottom-up, local perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

These technological trends, alongside major value transformations like the green transition and climate change, necessitate new ways of working, particularly cross-sectorally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. Governments must also consider their "karma" â€“ their ethical footprint and future consequences of current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. While governments should be humble about controlling complexity, they must be ambitious in impacting the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

## Approaches to [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance]]

### Strategic Foresight and Future Thinking
[[Anticipatory innovation and futures thinking | Strategic foresight]] is essential for governments to address drivers that will transform the operating environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Key practices include:
*   **Scouting:** Detecting early signals of change and identifying emerging issues, giving them names to facilitate conversation and ideation among leaders and policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. For example, recognizing the "gig" and "human cloud" concepts before the term "gig economy" was widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
*   **Disciplined Processes:** Implementing structured processes like scenario planning, which, though tedious, provides a methodical approach to exploring futures and converting participants to future thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.
*   **Challenging Mindsets:** Using foresight to identify and challenge mindsets or structures incompatible with desired futures. This can involve immersing stakeholders in future scenarios to create empathy and a "lived experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Examples include resistance to remote work despite smart city infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>, or procurement processes impeding agile ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **Growing Capability:** Building and nurturing the capability to think about the future across public agencies, combining formal training with practical "doing as training." This includes building communities of practice and encouraging collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. Organizations like the Centre for Strategic Futures in Singapore utilize a "revolving door" policy to train officers in future thinking and then release them back into the system as "multipliers" and advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.

### Redefining Design and Leadership
The radical changes experienced, such as the pandemic, create a "liquefaction moment" where established norms become fluid, presenting an opportune time for significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. This shifts the focus from "human-centered design" to "human-connected design," which considers humans connected to each other, AI, infrastructure, places, and the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

New leadership for [[Anticipatory Innovation | innovation]] involves:
*   Discovering what kind of change is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   Leading through exploration, openness, and discovery, rather than control and detailed administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   Exploring problems and leveraging empathy with citizens' needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   Navigating ambiguity and open-endedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   Insisting on rehearsing, experimenting, and trying out the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### New Thinking and Organizational Structures
"Expansive thinking" is needed to enhance engagement with critical global challenges and expand into new types of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This includes thinking differently about time horizons (e.g., 2050 or 9,000-year strategies) and proximity to people, values, and cross-sectoral collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

Organizational changes supporting [[Anticipatory innovation and its importance | anticipatory innovation]] include:
*   **Self-management:** Embracing peer relationships and flatter structures, inspired by concepts like "reinventing organizations" and "teal organizations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Wholeness:** Allowing individuals to bring their whole selves to work, not just their professional persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Purpose-driven:** Leveraging the public sector's inherent meaningful purposes to embrace new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **People-centric values:** Governing and leading by believing that people want to make a difference, have influence, be challenged, take responsibility, and thrive in trust and recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Building Dynamic and Resilient Governance
The goal is to make public organizations dynamic and resilient by design, rather than separating stable and dynamic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>. This requires several key capabilities:

*   **Reframing Problems:** The ability to take problems out of policy silos and reframe them in ways that citizens understand and motivate public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. This means adapting problem framing as the future constantly changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.
*   **Openness by Design:** Public organizations must become more open, engaging various stakeholders and viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. This includes flatter organizational structures, team focus, and open digital infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.
*   **Ethics of Innovation:** A critical emerging capability for civil servants to innovate in spaces of radical uncertainty, considering their own ethics and biases while incorporating diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.
*   **Diverse Analytical Capacities:** Moving beyond backward-looking analytical tools to incorporate diverse viewpoints, such as ethnographic analysis, to better understand and anticipate future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

Governments also need the confidence to envision new futures, integrate new forms of data for decision-making, and collaborate as a whole system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. This involves bringing the public along and fostering open government decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>. The "Overton window" of what is politically and fiscally possible has expanded, creating new opportunities for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>. By aligning with demographic shifts (e.g., Generation Covid), governments can leverage these "fair winds" for rapid, relevant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

Like a "trim tab" on a ship, small interventions in innovation labs or by individuals can break existing tensions and multiply impact across a complex system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>. Governments must seize this moment to drive positive futures by expanding their collective imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.

### Challenging Entrenched Futures
Several futures are already being written without full realization, and these must be challenged:
*   **Digital Giants and Regulation:** The influence of digital giants is shaping the public sector, and governments are "way behind" in understanding and regulating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. These entities increasingly influence individual decisions and deepen existing societal divides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.
*   **Nature of Conflict:** The traditional understanding of conflict is at odds with emerging realities like mass disinformation campaigns targeting individuals, which functions as a form of warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.
*   **Capitalism Paradigm:** The entrenched idea of capitalism as an opposition between government and market ignores that markets are co-created by various actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. Public organizations need to be more radical in rethinking desired market forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.
*   **Growth Narrative:** The predominant focus on GDP growth as a measure of national future fails to address critical issues like climate change and inequality, which have worsened despite economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.
*   **Linearity and Progress:** The deep-seated paradigm of linearity, driven by modernism and technocentric rationality, assumes a progressive, ever-better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. However, current generations often believe the future will be worse than the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. This requires a collective imagination to build more inclusive, circular, and connected economies, which will challenge existing power structures but also unlock immense opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.

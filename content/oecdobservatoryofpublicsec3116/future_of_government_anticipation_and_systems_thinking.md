The "Government Aftershock" initiative was a global undertaking involving over 65 events and 5,500 participants worldwide. It was unified by three core questions: what to leave behind, what to keep, and what to do differently given what has been learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The initiative aimed to understand what the crisis revealed about the workings of government and where it needs to head next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## The Need for Reimagined Government

The relationship between people and government has become increasingly frayed over the past decade due to a series of global shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis in 2020 sharply highlighted the need for government to operate differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Much of the previous debate focused on what government should do, how services should be structured, or how decisions should be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. However, insufficient emphasis has been placed on *how* government should be and the principles driving its actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The Secretary-General of the OECD stated that "going back to normal is the last thing we want because the normal that we had before was not good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. This sentiment highlights the urgency for governments to adapt to complex future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

## Core Beliefs for Reimagined Government

The Center for Public Impact (CPI), a not-for-profit foundation working with government leaders and communities, released a vision for a reimagined government that embraces complexity, relationship building, and experimentation for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This vision is based on three core beliefs:
1.  **Complexity**: Most societal challenges are complex in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The Melbourne workshop explored the need to embrace complexity and think more in [[systems_thinking_and_anticipatory_innovation_governance | systems]] in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
2.  **Relationships**: The quality of human relationships matters greatly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Events in London and Washington D.C. emphasized relationship building by listening to seldom-heard voices and collaborating across silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
3.  **Experimentation**: Progress is best achieved through experimentation and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The pandemic forced an experimental mindset across government, and the key question is whether this can be sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

These beliefs give rise to values that guide the future of government, particularly in rebuilding a post-COVID society. Leaders are called upon to:
*   Think systematically but act locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   Share power with those best placed to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Challenge unnecessary hierarchy and collaborate across boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   Seek out strengths and build on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   Champion the voices of those least heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   Optimize for learning rather than control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Key Insights from Government Aftershock Events

Discussions across various "Government Aftershock" events revealed common themes regarding what governments need to stop, start, and continue doing.

### What to Keep Doing
*   **Collaboration and Collective Learning**: Initiatives like "Government Aftershock" itself are vital for creating a community for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. There has been significant outreach, cross-sectoral collaboration, and breakdown of silos within and across governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Sam Ray of Conservation Volunteers Australia noted a "much more joined up thinking and more collective learning on the whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Shortened Feedback Loops**: In frontline services, shortened feedback loops with central government have been a welcome side effect of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This eliminated much bureaucracy, as seen with homeless charity Groundswell feeding back community needs to NHS England in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### What to Leave Behind
*   **Short-term Thinking**: The pandemic presented an opportunity to think bigger picture and break the political cycle-driven need for short-term solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Movements like Black Lives Matter have also created space for more long-term discussions and [[systems_thinking_and_anticipatory_innovation_governance | systems thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Rigid Ways of Working**: Failures of public sector agencies were attributed to rigid ways of working and the assumption that government has all the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Governments have become more comfortable admitting uncertainty and experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Siloed, Linear Thinking**: Current practices, processes, and institutions are not conducive to [[systems_thinking_and_anticipatory_innovation_governance | systems thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Misha Core of the Australian Taxation Office emphasized the need for "unlearning" â€” letting go of historical assumptions and mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### What to Start Doing
*   **Building Relationships in Unexpected Ways**: There has been significant cross-sectoral and cross-silo interaction, which is a great starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Building trusting relationships between government and citizens requires vulnerability from leaders, as argued by Jerome Harvey of The Tope Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Inclusive Recovery**: The pandemic and movements like Black Lives Matter present a real opportunity to reimagine who the economy is built for and how it's structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Two Scenarios for Government in a Post-COVID World

Jose Mendez Mendoza outlined two scenarios for how COVID-19 acts as a major force for change:

### Scenario 1: Collaboration in the Public Sector
*   **Engagement**: Public servants and institutions need to engage more, fostering coordination, collaboration, and "silo interplay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. National institutions should engage more with local levels, including local governments, think tanks, and universities, to prepare for future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **Institutional Diversity**: COVID-19 showed that traditional, "one-size-fits-all" solutions are no longer valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. Differences within public servants (e.g., digital skills) and how governments act towards diverse groups (women, migrants) were not reflected, leading to disproportionate impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Creating Anticipatory Capacities**: While trends like digitalization and government agility have been tracked for years, the pandemic hit in an unforeseen way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This necessitates new measures and skills for evaluating activities, speed, and consequences of government decisions in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Turning Around Old Structures
*   **High-Frequency, Disaggregated Data**: The crisis exposed issues with misinformation and government's inability to effectively prevent and respond to the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. There is a need for disaggregated, diverse, and fluid data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Managers of Well-being**: Public sectors, traditionally "delivery institutions" that deliver service orders, need to evolve into "managers of well-being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This means not just delivering services, but delivering smartly and creating an environment where people feel safe, can trust in governments, and can develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. New definitions of well-being are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Agile Bureaucracy**: While many services were digitized (put online), bureaucracies often remained the same in the back end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. True digitization goes beyond simply transposing physical processes online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

## Key Takeaways on Government Working Methods

### 1. Government's Innovation Capability
The crisis demonstrated government's capacity to innovate, be agile, adapt quickly, work remotely, and collaborate across silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. The challenge is to sustain this and ensure it's reflected in the entire system, leadership, and how government is built, not just individual responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

### 2. Rapid Digital Transformation & Data Use
Society digitized overnight out of necessity, implementing changes in days that would normally take years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. However, this comes with responsibilities for government, as regulations have lagged behind the rapid changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>
> Human-centric regulations must go hand-in-hand with digitization approaches from the government. Data privacy, transparency, and digital rights must be at the core of every strategy.

Digital approaches are tools, not replacements for human elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. Regulations must protect people's rights and ensure an inclusive, human-centered process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. Governments must critically reflect on whether existing approaches should be merely transposed online or fundamentally rethought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

### 3. Collaboration
Collaboration occurred across government levels, country borders, and societal sectors (individuals, private, non-profit, government) due to common problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. The challenge is to sustain this collaboration when common problems are less apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. Local governments, with their direct connections to citizens and networks, are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. Collaboration with private and non-profit sectors, seen through hackathons and challenge-based procurement, also needs to continue beyond crisis scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. The pandemic highlighted that modern challenges span the entire world, making international collaboration more critical than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

### 4. Trust and Transparency
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>
> "Trust is what makes the difference between the success and the unsuccess of our measures in this time of pandemic crisis. Trust begins with communication, communication and participation." â€” Maria Fonseca, Secretary of State of Portugal

Governments changed communication strategies to be more human-centered and deliberately targeted hard-to-reach communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. Participatory processes are essential for involving everyone in decision-making, leading to increased trust and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. Governments' openness about uncertainty and their lack of all answers during the crisis led to increased trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. However, trust is built over time and must be sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

## Policy Priorities and Inclusion
The crisis revealed significant gaps in policy priorities, particularly in welfare policies where emergency benefits were more extensive than traditional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Issues like gender-based violence and systemic racism also came to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. The focus must be on addressing these multifaceted, interconnected problems, improving citizens' well-being, and fostering caring societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>
> "Listen, learn, and adapt. I've learned that people are not hard to reach, they're seldom heard. They can be your biggest cheerleaders. Work with them. They are your recovery and your rebuild." â€” Nadine, Center for Public Impact

## Approaching Futures and Uncertainty
The complex future challenges demand that governments proactively probe into the future and try different approaches to steer towards preferred outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>
> "Just because we are afraid of something doesn't mean we shouldn't deal with it. If we don't, we have a danger of it becoming really explosive." â€” Aaron Mannium, Singapore

This means using new methods unfamiliar to government and investing in approaches that look beyond pure risk aversion to the complexity of government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. A poll during the "Government Aftershock" event asked participants which innovation methods they would like to see gain more traction beyond COVID-19. The top responses were [[anticipatory_innovation_and_futures_thinking | anticipation and futures thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>, followed by [[systems_thinking_and_anticipatory_innovation_governance | systems approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a> and agile and adaptive working methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. This indicates a clear appetite for new approaches, recognizing the need to implement them before the next challenge arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Call to Action and Future Outlook

The current moment represents a "pivot point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. The question is how to ensure that governments truly heed the lessons learned from the pandemic and embed them into their working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. It's crucial to connect, empower, and legitimize efforts both within and outside government to demand better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.

The "Government Aftershock" initiative itself served as a collective learning prototype, demonstrating a different way of collective learning and sense-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. The ambition is to create a "call to action" that outlines a provocation for governments and all stakeholders, prompting reflection on what everyone will do differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>. Change requires active participation from everyone, not just governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. This initiative aims to hammer home insights and make them actionable, aligning with or influencing governments' future intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

Key desired outcomes for the call to action include:
*   Actionable guidance for increasing experimentation and a values-led approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   Best practices in [[anticipatory_innovation_and_futures_thinking | futures thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.
*   A truly actionable call for governments that provides inspiration for what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
*   A multi-disciplinary approach to improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

This initiative seeks to provide insights to help inform those determining the future state of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

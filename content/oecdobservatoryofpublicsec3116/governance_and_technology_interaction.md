The need for governments to respond to emerging challenges is particularly acute, driven by widespread events like climate change, migration, and rapidly developing issues [00:00:44]. The environment is characterized by [[complexity_in_governance | complex systems]] and problems that have become the norm rather than the exception [00:01:07]. This necessitates a shift from a reactive mode to a proactive approach in policy-making [00:01:19].

## The Imperative for Proactive Governance
Governments are currently proving increasingly inadequate with a purely reactive approach to policy setting [00:01:50]. Instead, there is a strong need to anticipate and respond innovatively before issues fully emerge [00:02:02]. This involves developing the ability to both respond to unforeseen challenges expediently and to adapt, as well as to anticipate different futures and prepare for these realities [00:02:08]. The aim is to build a system that helps policymakers learn from innovation and strategic insight [00:02:27]. This proactive stance is crucial for strengthening [[public_trust_and_governance | public trust]] and democracy [00:02:51]. [[Anticipatory governance in government and technology | Anticipatory innovation governance]] can strengthen trust not only from citizens towards government but also vice versa [00:03:10]. The growing pressures of democratic change, economic and social consequences of global pandemics, climate change, and evolving dynamics of the digital environment highlight where trust and anticipatory governance are vital for society [00:03:31].

## Finland's Approach to Anticipatory Governance
Finland, working in close partnership with the OECD, is actively addressing these issues [00:00:30]. They aim to build a functioning, practical, and implementable [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipatory innovation governance system]] that can serve as a blueprint for other nations [00:04:30]. Finland considers itself at an early stage, but optimistic about building a new governance model that stimulates policy-making for future needs [00:15:50].

Key building blocks in Finland include:
*   **Strategic Planning System Changes**: The move to a strategic government program system, first implemented in 2015, is considered a significant system exchange [00:17:03].
*   **Experimentation Culture**: Finland has experience in setting up an experimentation culture and enabling legislation [00:17:42].
*   **Digitalization and Ecosystemic Approaches**: Extensive work in digitalization and adopting ecosystemic approaches in many fields contribute to their progress [00:17:56].
*   **Innovation Models**: Finland has more experience with enhancing innovation, mission-oriented innovation, and adaptive innovation, with [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipatory innovation]] as the next ambition [00:18:12].

A current challenge for Finland is linking intensive foresight work with actual political decision-making processes, as foresight is often still a separate exercise [00:18:48]. There is a need to widen the understanding of the urgency for governance system changes to meet rapid and thorough transformations in society [00:20:09]. Motivating and involving political decision-makers is a particular concern, as changes in policy often have wide social consequences [00:20:28]. New elements that entrust the public sector with its responsibility as a guardian of the democratic base are needed, moving towards real-life co-creation and co-design approaches involving citizens and other stakeholders in a proactive role [00:21:16].

## Ireland's Strategic Foresight Journey
Ireland is embarking on a similar journey to introduce strategic foresight systematically into its policy-making process [00:24:51]. The motivation arose from the experiences of the financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impending climate crisis, prompting questions about how the public service could be fit for purpose out to 2030 and beyond [00:25:52].

Ireland's approach involves:
*   **Current State Analysis**: Identifying existing pockets of strategic foresight across the public service and understanding their extent [00:27:59].
*   **Collaboration with OECD**: Working with the OECD to explore options and models, learning from best practices in countries like Finland, Singapore, and the Netherlands [00:28:18].
*   **Capacity Building**: Developing a strategic foresight action plan with European Commission funding for capacity building across the public service [00:29:43].
*   **Integrated Governance**: Plugging the strategic foresight initiative into existing governance systems, such as the Public Service Leadership Board, to ensure top-management support [00:30:00].
*   **Policy Development Integration**: Ensuring that strategic foresight is directly integrated into the wider policy development system, rather than remaining a standalone exercise [00:32:00].

The goal is to move from simply factoring in future trends to using strategic foresight to interpret signals and take a longer-term perspective in policy decisions [00:27:17].

## Radical Experimentation in Government
Experimentation is key to building evidence for future directions and exploring potential futures [00:44:00].

### Canada's Approach to Government Experimentation
Canada has been working for about five years to make its government more experimental, defining experimentation as the process of rigorously measuring if new things work [00:45:58].

Key activities in Canada:
*   **Capacity Building**: Running a "Experimentation Works" training program across government, pairing experts with projects that want to experiment [00:47:42].
*   **Community of Practice**: Supporting a community of practice for experimentation within government through learning events and courses [00:48:23].
*   **Systems Change**: Working on systemic changes to make experimentation easier, including issuing directives to senior public servants and conducting annual surveys to track experimentation and the use of its results [00:48:34].

Common barriers encountered include:
*   **Access to Expertise**: Lack of methodological expertise to run rigorous experiments and process expertise to navigate government systems [00:49:45].
*   **Data Availability**: Challenges with data quality, organization, and storage, which are essential for measuring effectiveness [00:50:15].
*   **Openness to Failure**: A cultural barrier where risking failure is scary, despite experiments needing the possibility of failure to yield new insights [00:50:39]. The counter-argument is that the status quo is also risky, and experimentation can reduce long-term risk by identifying what works [00:51:06].
*   **Timelines**: Experiments often yield useful results a year or two in advance, making it hard to apply them to urgent, short-term ministerial demands [00:51:24].
*   **Precedent**: The difficulty of doing new things in government where precedent is powerful. Building case studies and examples of success is crucial [00:51:54].

There is no one right path for building experimentation; it depends on context, but the goal is to build momentum in an [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipatory way]] before it becomes urgent [00:52:17].

### Sweden's Technology Innovation and Ethics Committee (Komet)
Sweden's Komet Committee aims to deliver policy proposals to better handle rapid technology development, with an overarching ambition to increase speed towards Agenda 2030 sustainability goals and ensure responsibility for innovation and technology [00:54:57]. Komet's model is based on three parts: understanding, testing, and changing [00:56:56].

*   **Understanding**: Continuously understanding what is happening and creating safe mechanisms for this [00:57:30]. This involves knowledge building, like developing "technology briefs" to explain how technology affects policy [00:58:38]. It also requires financing for regulatory interactive activities, allowing regulatory authorities to interact with companies [00:59:12].
*   **Testing**: Creating "regulatory greenhouses" as transparent spaces where different actors (agencies, companies, civil servants, civil society) can jointly test new things under real conditions [01:00:13]. The government has proposed a strategy for testing and developing methodologies to support, follow up, incentivize, and audit testing [01:01:17].
*   **Changing**: Adopting a more agile and step-wise approach to regulation and policy change [01:02:30]. This means starting with understanding, then setting standards or working with agreements, and finally developing legislation [01:02:37]. Komet itself develops small, easy-to-implement proposals instead of gigantic reports [01:03:01].

The process is seen as a cultural journey, not a revolution, spanning several decades, emphasizing collaboration and building capabilities across the public sector [01:04:03]. It requires a framework for generic aspects of [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipation]], enabling municipalities, regions, and agencies to report regulatory problems hindering innovation and testing [01:03:52].

### Norway's Seamless Services and Life Events
Norway is working on developing "seamless public services" for seven prioritized life events, which requires both systemic innovation and [[digital_transformation_and_egovernance | digital transformation]] [01:16:30]. The project supports ministries, county authorities, and central government agencies in collaborating to develop user-centric digital services [01:17:29]. The Norwegian Digitalization Agency supports these life events by providing advice, creating an ecosystem for cooperation, and developing/testing new methodologies, including [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | foresight]] and [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipatory innovation]] methodology [01:17:40].

One life event, "starting and managing a voluntary organization," is testing a [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | foresight]] and [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipation]] approach [01:19:36]. By establishing an understanding of the voluntary sector and exploring the future through scenarios, it becomes easier to establish a mission [01:19:59]. This helps prioritize development areas for new services based on future user needs and leads to a transformation phase [01:20:33].

A key challenge is working across current government silos, as future needs don't fit into existing departmental structures [01:22:10]. Scenario planning helps create a common platform for different sector representatives to discuss future driving forces and uncertainties, leading to shared perspectives and better strategic decisions [01:22:32]. The program acts as an "innovation space" for testing new ways of working, cooperating, steering, and anchoring processes [01:24:26].

Regarding digital ethics and public privacy in the context of rapid technological innovation, it's crucial to consider future trust and involve technical startups, private businesses, and the voluntary sector in developing seamless services through testing and learning together [01:25:08].

## Broader Perspectives on [[Future governance and leadership | Future Governance]]

### Foresight and Democracy
The Project on Foresight and Democracy aimed to enhance civil discourse in the United States by buttressing it against hyper-partisanship [01:42:28]. The "roundtable process" involved assembling an advisory panel of futures analysts and a diverse panel of experienced individuals [01:42:42]. This process identified highly disruptive, longer-range trends (e.g., advanced AI, synthetic biology, social surveillance systems, extreme climate change, demographic changes) and used foresight techniques [01:43:09].

Discussions focused on the interaction between these rising forces and core values, promoting early recognition of challenges and opportunities for governance integration through networked operations and continuous monitoring [01:44:45]. The key learning was that working with people on methods for thinking better, rather than telling them what to think, leads to absorption and application of ideas [01:45:11]. The current stage involves testing this concept in a university setting to equip students with a more fluid view of events in a democracy seen as a [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | complex adaptive system]] [01:46:00]. The ultimate goal is a national network to support conversations about the future of democratic values and governance systems [01:47:14].

### Global Application and Ethical Considerations
There is a clear need for [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipatory governance]] concepts to be applied at the global level to resolve challenges beyond individual national governments or regional groupings [01:47:56]. The OECD's efforts are seen as a hopeful shift in this direction, as it is an influential center for best practices [01:48:10]. Decisions made today, such as those concerning radioactive waste disposal or carbon dioxide storage, can influence futures for millennia, posing a significant test for the application of foresight to policy [01:49:08].

A fundamental challenge is the dominant human tendency to approach the world with a preemptive, colonizing, and superior position, reflected in hierarchical, command-and-control governance systems [01:54:10]. This leads to perpetuating objectionable structures. [[Technology foresight and governance | Anticipatory governance]] needs to reconcile with [[complexity_in_governance | complexity]] and a notion of non-hierarchical, non-deterministic assemblages [01:56:37].

Transformation is unknowable, while transition is doable [01:57:07]. The focus should be on acting ethically in the present [01:57:16]. Anticipation is fundamental to life, and humanity can become much better at its diverse uses [01:57:48].

A major concern is whether institutions have the right policy-making processes to think ahead and tackle complex, ambiguous challenges like the Farm to Fork strategy [02:00:16]. Often, traditional policy document production may not be the right approach [02:01:47]. Instead, [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | multi-disciplinary approaches]] are needed, involving diverse backgrounds like designers and ethnographers, to co-create policy and involve stakeholders from the very framing of an issue [02:02:57]. The challenge lies in moving out of institutional comfort zones and embracing risk for necessary paradigm shifts [02:16:52].

### Paradigm Shifts
Responding to paradigm shifts is difficult due to their unpredictable nature and challenges in budgeting [02:05:32]. It is important to approach such shifts with an understanding of [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | systems and complexity]], acknowledging that while complete control is impossible, influence is achievable [02:06:05]. It may be necessary to completely rethink existing systems if they are no longer viable [02:06:56].

Finding individuals who naturally think beyond normal confines and giving them protected opportunities to express those thoughts, even if initially seen as "ridiculous," is crucial [02:08:10]. Sources of imaginative thinking, such as science fiction, can foreshadow future realities [02:09:26]. An example is the accelerating development of advanced artificial intelligence, which is projected to create discontinuous effects and profound societal challenges within a decade, challenging the present organization of society and economics [02:10:12].

Governments and large organizations often struggle to appreciate and plan for such paradigmatic shifts, preferring to maintain an "immortality" posture rather than embracing the natural evolution and potential "death" of institutions [02:14:40]. The tendency to translate everything into risk assessments and probabilities, despite human inability to effectively deal with probabilities, can stifle innovation [02:17:28].

Key levers for jump-starting strategic foresight or [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipatory innovation]] processes in government include:
*   **Empowerment**: Giving permission to empower those actually dealing with problems, allowing them to envision their own future and define their own challenges [02:21:01].
*   **Collaboration, Co-creation, Co-design**: Fostering these approaches in policy development [02:21:59].
*   **Humility**: Acknowledging that leaders do not have all the answers and expressing a willingness to discover solutions together with an open mind [02:22:13].
*   **Managed Transition**: While accepting the end of things, the proper function of governance is to manage transitions for the future, considering the well-being of people during these changes, especially given risks like nuclear conflict [02:24:54].# Governance and Technology Interaction

Governments innovate for various reasons, sometimes with a clear purpose and sometimes for the sake of exploration. Both approaches are beneficial for fostering [[innovation_in_government | innovation in government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Innovation Driven by Specific Challenges

One key driver for [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] is the need to solve known challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For instance, addressing issues like ocean clean-up or homelessness requires specific [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] to reach targeted outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This provides a clear direction for [[innovation_strategies_in_government | innovation activities]] and legitimizes the necessity for [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] based on the problem itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Innovation for the Sake of Exploration and Creativity

Conversely, governments also innovate simply to allow individuals to explore new ideas and be creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. [[innovation_in_government | Innovation]] is inherently new and uncertain, and the next breakthrough often comes from unexpected places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Allowing people to explore new ideas is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

In the private sector, this is known as "entrepreneurial discovery," where transformative ideas often originate from those with the freedom to experiment and "play around" with new thinking, as exemplified by inventions like the combustion engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This same license for exploration should extend to the public sector to revamp and transform services and products, making them better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Learning by Doing: Developing Innovation Capability

A third reason for civil servants to innovate is to develop their own capacity for [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Innovators are not born but learn to explore new ideas and think in new ways through practiceâ€”a process of "learning by doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This necessitates a license to experiment with new ideas and apply them in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

By doing so, governments build a workforce capable of [[strategies_for_fostering_government_innovation | innovating]] when new challenges arise, enabling them to build projects and solve problems in entirely new ways because they have prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This trend is evident in modern governments; for example, Finland has a new program for [[experimentation_in_government_innovation | experimentation]] at the central government level, and Canada has an [[experimentation_in_government_innovation | experimentation]] directive in action, allowing departments to test policy ideas before large-scale implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Staying Current and Avoiding Stagnation

Finally, governments also innovate to avoid being left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. When neighboring governments are [[role_of_governments_in_fostering_innovation | innovating]], it prompts others to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Unexplored options can represent a cost, and governments need to explore different avenues to remain competitive and prepared for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This mirrors the private sector, where companies like Apple and Sony constantly explore new ideas and solutions, not always for immediate application, but for potential future relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

These diverse reasons for [[governments_role_in_promoting_innovation | government innovation]] highlight the need for different methods and [[innovation_strategies_in_government | innovation strategies]] to achieve their varied goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

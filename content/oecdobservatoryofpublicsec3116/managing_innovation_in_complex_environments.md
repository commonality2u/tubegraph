Innovation in the public sector is often perceived through its resounding successes, such as a robot doing flips or artificial intelligence applied to solve hurricanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. However, what is typically unseen are the "tears, the sweat," the failures, false starts, and missteps that occur before a grand success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. The Observatory for Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) at the OECD aims to [[challenges_in_managing_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | demystify public sector innovation]] by showing what it truly takes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:04">[03:19:04]</a>.

## Challenges in Public Sector Innovation

Public sector organizations face unique challenges in managing innovation:
*   **Aversion to Failure:** Failure is not often discussed or celebrated, leading to a focus solely on triumphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:26">[02:48:26]</a>.
*   **Pre-defined Problems and Solutions:** Civil servants often begin innovation processes *after* the investigation phase, with problems already defined, or even solutions handed to them for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:07">[05:57:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. This leaves little room for problem framing, leading to disappointing results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
*   **Political Environment:** Politicians may arrive with pre-conceived solutions, limiting the public sector's ability to redefine problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:04">[07:21:04]</a>.
*   **[[challenges_of_organizational_change_for_innovation | Groupthink and Lack of Diversity]]:** Too much time spent together can lead to similar thinking and vocabulary, stifling creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:26">[12:48:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>.
*   **Expert Bias:** Long-term expertise can sometimes hinder the expansion of potential solutions, especially in the ideation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:05">[21:08:05]</a>.
*   **"Innovation Theater":** Leaders may verbally support innovation without providing the necessary resources, capacity, or slack time, making innovation a "side-of-the-desk activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:01">[29:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>. This often stems from a lack of understanding of the innovation process rather than malicious intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:00">[31:48:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Control:** The public sector often deals with complex problems (e.g., social services, changing human behavior) over which they have limited control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:45:15">[35:45:15]</a>.
*   **Ineffective Filtering Methods:** Simplistic scoring models for filtering ideas are often insufficient because they don't account for the type of innovation or the inherent biases in pitching processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:50">[49:52:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:07">[50:27:07]</a>.
*   **Path Dependency:** Developed countries often struggle with radical innovation due to deeply institutionalized systems and practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:28:44">[57:28:44]</a>.

## Strategies for Managing Innovation

### 1. The Innovation Life Cycle
OPSI outlines an innovation life cycle:
1.  Identifying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
2.  Generating ideas (ideation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
3.  Developing proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
4.  Implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
5.  Evaluation and diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### 2. Prioritizing Problem Framing
A key strategy is to spend more time in problem framing. Even if a problem is assigned, it's crucial to understand its context before moving to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:04">[06:56:04]</a>. This approach aims to prevent projects from failing or not delivering expected value due to a superficial understanding of the core issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

### 3. Understanding Ideation
[[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | Ideation]] is more than just brainstorming with sticky notes; it's about finding the best ideas from internal and external sources, and then effectively screening and prioritizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

### 4. Cultivating Creativity
Creativity is a resource that must be cultivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. Strategies to increase creativity include:
*   **Diversity:** Expanding the number of experiences and backgrounds of people involved in ideation and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.
*   **Constructive Conflict:** Building in a "little bit of conflict" to challenge perspectives and generate more creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>.
*   **Mobility/Rotation:** Rotating people in teams to counter groupthink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptability:** Recognizing that creativity also means adapting existing solutions to new contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>, such as applying an Xbox system to solve a problem in a different industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>.
*   **Diverse Information Intake:** Reading a diverse set of materials to challenge assumptions and understand what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.
*   **Experience:** Providing opportunities to test ideas and gain experience with "thinking outside the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:00">[25:54:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Engagement:** Having experts directly engage with the problem and interact with citizens or those with lived experiences, rather than relying solely on their defined expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Outcomes:** Starting from observing whether current outcomes are satisfactory helps create urgency and openness to new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.
*   **Good Facilitation:** Utilizing objective, critical outside voices to guide discussions and ensure experts temporarily set aside their "expert hat" to explore problems from a blank slate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a>.

### 5. Categorizing Innovation Types
Innovation is not one-size-fits-all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. OPSI considers two dimensions:
1.  **Uncertainty:** From certainty (exploiting/incremental innovation, e.g., making existing systems more efficient) to uncertainty (exploratory/radical innovation, e.g., dealing with AI or blockchain where solutions are unknown) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.
2.  **Direction:** From clear directive/top-down demand (mission-oriented innovation, e.g., reforming education) to adaptive innovation (user-driven, bottom-up experimentation based on citizen feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>.

Different types of problems and innovation goals require different ideation sources and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>. For high uncertainty, external signals and developers/partners are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>. For design- or citizen-oriented problems, stakeholders and target groups must be involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:20:00">[41:20:00]</a>.

### 6. Ideation Checklist
A basic checklist for ideation helps ensure the process is appropriate and effective:
1.  **Problem Framing:** Have you spent enough time studying and "fallen in love" with the problem, ensuring readiness for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>? Avoid moving too quickly to solutions based on limited data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:00">[34:34:00]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Environment:** Do you understand the top-down/bottom-up dynamics, leadership's resistance to change, and the broader political and organizational environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a>?
3.  **Strategy Match:** Does your ideation strategy match the environment and the type of problem (e.g., using broad crowdsourcing for uncertain problems, or more narrow co-creation for complex, wicked problems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:23:00">[36:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>?
4.  **Inclusivity:** Does your strategy allow everyone to contribute, accounting for different working styles (e.g., allowing time for quiet thinkers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>?
5.  **Right People Engaged:** Is the group diverse in backgrounds, thinking styles, and gender to avoid homogenous thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:08:00">[39:08:00]</a>?

### 7. Filtering and Prioritizing Ideas
Instead of simplified scoring models, the filtering process should align with the purpose of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:50">[49:52:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16:00">[51:16:00]</a>. For mission-oriented innovation, consistency with the mission is key, not necessarily novelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>. For anticipatory or radical ideas, legitimacy or risk might not be primary concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:14:00">[49:14:00]</a>. It's crucial to be transparent in selection methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47:00">[46:47:00]</a>.

### 8. [[collective_system_change_through_innovation | Organizational Capabilities]]
Building organizational capability in innovation goes beyond individual skills; it involves fostering motivations and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:15:00">[53:15:00]</a>. It's about building a culture where innovation is a normal practice, not a side activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:47:00">[53:47:00]</a>. Teams, especially diverse ones, are crucial for generating new ideas and operating methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:02:00">[54:02:00]</a>. Maintaining workplace civility and professional disagreement allows for constructive critique without personal attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:02:00">[55:02:00]</a>.

### 9. Innovation in Emerging Countries
Emerging countries often exhibit high levels of innovation, sometimes even more so than developed ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10:00">[56:10:00]</a>. This is because they may lack the deeply institutionalized infrastructure and "path dependency" that can hinder massive transformations in developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:20:00">[56:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:28:44">[57:28:44]</a>. They are often "bootstrapping" solutions and testing many ideas due to fewer investment resources, leading to highly creative public service and social service innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:40:00">[56:40:00]</a>.

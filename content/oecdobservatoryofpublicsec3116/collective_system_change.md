Collective system change focuses on stewarding innovation portfolios to achieve large-scale transformations in multi-stakeholder environments or ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This emerging practice is crucial for governments, especially given the increasing pace of change and diversifying problems, which means there is no single, one-size-fits-all approach to public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Governments are increasingly expected to handle unforeseen challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Innovation Portfolios and Stewardship

The core idea is to approach innovation with intentionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This practice involves using frameworks for clarification, [[sensemaking_and_organizational_adaptation | sense-making]], and orienting future action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. A key challenge is applying this in a multi-stakeholder environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Innovation Facets Model
The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) uses its "Innovation Facets Model" for portfolio management, developed from work with governments at national, regional, and sub-national levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This model describes four broad purposes of innovation:
*   **Mission-oriented innovation** focuses on overall societal goals and challenges, directing action in a top-down way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** aims to improve existing practices, making them more efficient and widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation** addresses new or expressed needs, creating spaces for bottom-up exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation** looks at extreme uncertainty to shape changes based on future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

The OPSI uses this model as a framing device for important conversations and to seed action around portfolios, clarifying what exists and for what purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This helps understand relationships between activities and purposes, guiding future directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Driving Portfolio Transitions
A crucial aspect is understanding what drives portfolio transitions beyond inherent contextual factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. These drivers can include scandals, societal changes, or technological shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The key question is whether the current mix of choices is right for the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Even without intentional management, an innovation portfolio always exists as a mix of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

## Key Challenges in Collective System Change
Organizations implementing portfolios often face several challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>:
*   **Understanding the existing portfolio:** Conditions and requirements, such as policy context, organizational environment, and goals, shape the current portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Identifying stewardship:** It's often unclear who is stewarding a portfolio, whether it's an explicit role or an implicit team providing oversight and impulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Supporting all facets:** Most organizations tend to be strong in only one or two innovation facets, lacking explicit support structures for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Assessing balance:** Determining if the portfolio's balance reflects a temporary or long-term trend, and if it truly supports the overall organizational remit or public purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Organizations may find their portfolio is at odds with stated objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem actors:** Understanding the roles different ecosystem actors play in shaping the portfolio, and the need for roles to steward portfolios across teams, organizations, and wider ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Roles and Tools for Collective Action
Effective [[systems_change_and_collaboration | systems change and collaboration]] at the system level requires stewardship, ensuring overall coherence, compatibility, and interoperability of innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Since no one person or group can completely control an innovation system, some form of collective stewardship is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

### Key Roles and Approaches
*   **Mission Drivers:** Organizations like Viable Cities position themselves as "mission drivers," connecting governmental agencies, municipalities, and other portfolios of needs and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. Their role is more about coordinating, inspiring, creating collaboration opportunities, and conducting analysis, rather than direct management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>.
*   **City-Centricity:** Placing municipalities at the center, or "behind the steering wheel," of initiatives, viewing them as facilitators for wider city and multi-stakeholder approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.
*   **Neutral Facilitators:** Organizations like Future by Lund act as neutral entities, building trust and navigating gaps between business, city departments, and universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. This neutrality allows them to "jump off" projects once momentum is gained, as they don't own the outcomes but enable them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>.
*   **Idea Trackers and Connectors:** Continuously engage with partners to understand needs, track ideas, and identify potential. This involves asking "what do you need?" and then matching ideas with resources or initiating pre-studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.
*   **Social Capital Builders:** Beyond technical aspects, a significant part of the role involves building social capital within the ecosystem, working with entrepreneurs, and fostering a shared understanding of values and how to achieve goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>.

### Practical Tools and Mechanisms
*   **Climate City Contracts:** These are negotiated collaborations, revised and signed yearly by mayors and government agency directors, assigning commitments to national and city-level organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. They act as "stewarding ownerships and commitments to the portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>.
*   **Transition Labs:** Mechanisms for accelerating learning, clarifying common direction, leveraging synergies, renewing decision-making processes, and building dynamic capabilities for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Open Calls:** Used to engage interested cities and organizations globally, focusing efforts and driving collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>.
*   **Grant Allocation:** Using grants as a lever to trigger innovations and influencing upcoming grant calls based on analysis and dialogues with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>.
*   **Portfolio of Portfolios:** An approach that recognizes the need to align and connect efforts through learning mechanisms across different actors and governance levels to achieve broader missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This requires thinking about "open interfaces" between portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
*   **Common Vocabulary and Framing:** Establishing a shared language and frame of reference is foundational for collective management and movement of the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Visualizing Strengths and Gaps:** Tools like the Innovation Facets Model, when overlaid with local models (e.g., the "Zone Model"), can visualize portfolio strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in exploratory activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. This allows for identifying holes to fill or directions to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.
*   **Playing Field Metaphor:** Using diagrams to represent activities and discuss moving them across a "playing field" or "dance floor" (zones) based on desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>. This facilitates discussions about necessary functions and collaborations, and why certain priorities exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>.
*   **Understanding Different Logics:** Recognizing that various organizations (companies, cities, universities) operate with different logics, even when sharing common goals like sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. The role of the facilitator is to decipher these differences and help connect diverse drivers and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:07">[01:32:07]</a>.

## Measuring Impact and Legitimacy
Evaluating impact in [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | complex systems]] and long-term [[systems_change_and_collaboration | systems change and collaboration]] is highly challenging, as standard models often fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a>. The focus shifts from merely achieving specific results to building the "muscle for achieving transformative change" and enhancing collective learning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>.

### Approaches to Evaluation
*   **Monitoring Transformative Change:** Beyond just measuring outputs (like CO2 emissions), the goal is to monitor how collective learning capacity and the ability to drive transformative change are enhanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:51">[01:43:51]</a>.
*   **Leverage Effects (Layer Model):** Inspired by other programs, one can track project investments as a proxy for a "gathering force" around a theme. This involves mapping how initial investments leverage additional projects and activities, and how partnerships change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Storytelling and Critical Events:** Qualitative reporting on critical events (e.g., ministerial visits, new initiatives) can trace the "impact story" over time, visualizing the scaling up of initial exploratory activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.
*   **Process Tracking and Agreed Indicators:** Instead of strict evaluation, focus on tracking transformative change processes in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:42">[01:45:42]</a>. This involves establishing a strategic direction, agreeing on appropriate indicators of success, and continuously feeding back progress to stakeholders to inform strategic adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>. This aligns with a developmental or formative evaluation approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:20">[01:46:20]</a>.
*   **Learning History Approach:** An emerging practice that involves structured reflectivity sessions and workshops where stakeholders come together to analyze what is happening and what can be learned from their practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. The aim is to institutionalize these sessions as part of normal operations, accelerating collective learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:37">[01:56:37]</a>.

### Maintaining Legitimacy
Given the long-term nature of collective system change, maintaining political legitimacy, especially for exploratory projects with invisible or unusual short-term results, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:07">[01:49:07]</a>.
*   **Higher-Level Mandates:** Relying on broader mandates from national or EU policy levels helps local politicians justify long-term initiatives, as these goals are "higher up in the ranking" and provide a stable reference point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:02">[01:50:02]</a>.
*   **Connecting to Daily Lives:** Emphasizing that climate transition also aims to create "better daily lives for citizens" links long-term goals to immediate, tangible benefits, thus generating broader appeal and legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>.
*   **Global Frameworks as Legitimacy:** The existence of global frameworks like the SDGs and Paris Agreement reinforces the idea that climate and sustainability work is not isolated but part of a larger, multi-scale effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:41">[01:52:41]</a>.
*   **Transparent Language:** Using common language and models, such as the Innovation Facets Model, helps explain the value of different activities, how they connect, and how they contribute to the overall portfolio and mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:48">[01:53:48]</a>. This transparency helps stakeholders understand their roles and value, fostering a sense of collective purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>.

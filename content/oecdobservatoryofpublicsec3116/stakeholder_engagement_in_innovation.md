Innovation is increasingly recognized as a process facilitated by the intricate interweaving of relationships among diverse actors with varied interests and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This contrasts with older views of innovation as a linear process or one-way technology transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Successful innovation relies on the effective engagement and orchestration of these stakeholders, drawing parallels to natural biophony where different creatures cooperate and respond to their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## The Concept of Biophony in Innovation

The concept of biophony, coined by Bernie Krause, describes the highly orchestrated acoustic arrangement in natural habitats where each creature has a niche and responds to others to be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This simultaneous, rich interweaving of sound allows animals to cooperate and respond to threats, essential for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The health of an ecosystem can be starkly indicated by its biophony; a decline in sound diversity reflects a decline in ecosystem health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

This analogy applies to innovation ecosystems:
*   A "cacophony of uncoordinated voices" needs to be orchestrated to foster harmony and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Governments and agencies must "listen and hear what's missing" to fill gaps between ideas and new products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   The goal is to help [[collaboration_and_peer_support_in_innovation | stakeholders]] hear each other, recognize complementarities, draw on capabilities, and develop coordinated, creative relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Challenges and Importance

Innovation ecosystems are complex systems characterized by interactions between heterogeneous actors, leading to emergent, non-linear, and unpredictable behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Their resilience stems from the diversity of actors and the flows of information and resources among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

A key challenge is avoiding a biased focus on mere innovation metrics or economic growth, instead concentrating on how the ecosystem truly functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Over-focusing on metrics can lead to "ordering" rather than orchestrating, attracting the wrong types of inputs, or an imbalance in the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Criteria for Successful Cooperation

A poll conducted during the webinar highlighted the most important criteria for successful cooperation between stakeholders in an ecosystem:
*   **Trust between stakeholders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a> (ranked highest).
*   **A clear shared purpose** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> (ranked second highest).
*   Other factors considered important included clear roles, adequate resources, and a dedicated ecosystem orchestrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

While a shared purpose is crucial, it's often difficult to define in multi-stakeholder partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. Some argue that fostering new relationships first, which can shift power dynamics, is necessary to arrive at new purposes, rather than a mere restatement of existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

## Strategies and Approaches for Engagement

Successful stakeholder engagement involves a blend of skills and strategic approaches:

### For Orchestrators and Teams
*   **Enthusiasm:** The team building the ecosystem must have genuine enthusiasm and willingness to try new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Practicality and Realism:** Emphasize practical aspects and identify realistic individual gains for all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Avoid abstract concepts that might seem unhelpful to industry partners focused on immediate projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Simplicity in Communication:** Design and explain concepts in a simple, understandable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **Shared and Individual Goals:** Set joint Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and clearly indicate both individual gains for each stakeholder and the collective gains the community can achieve together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Maturity Assessment:** Assess the maturity levels of stakeholders, understanding that companies at different life cycle stages have different goals and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This helps in coordinating and defining appropriate KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Building Trust with Coordinators:** Orchestrators must build and maintain trust with stakeholders by delivering on promises and demonstrating concrete results early on to avoid the perception of a "talking shop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

### For Broader Ecosystem Development
*   **Understanding Groundwork:** Have a very good understanding of the groundwork and preconditions of the situation in the local or regional context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Involving Key Players:** Bring together key decision-makers, "shakers, and movers" who can drive the agenda forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Holistic Situational Awareness:** Maintain a good situational picture of not only the focus area but also overall conditions nationally and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Inspiring Wider Networks:** Develop capabilities to inspire wider networks and communicate broadly to achieve a bigger impact on society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   **Continuous Evolution:** Emphasize evolution and revision as important parts of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Neutral Orchestration:** The presence of a neutral player can be very beneficial for building trust among diverse stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Leadership:** While not top-voted in a poll, a dedicated ecosystem orchestrator or multiple organizations providing leadership can be crucial for driving the process forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

### Fostering Systems Innovation
For innovating entire systems (e.g., healthcare, energy, mobility), a "washing machine" model suggests interactions between new entrepreneurial forces (disruptive ideas) and existing incumbents (seeking renewal or defending positions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This "washing machine" needs to be created, convened, commissioned, funded, and orchestrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. New systems emerge from the relationships formed within this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

Key roles in this process include:
*   Investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>
*   "Exiters" (those leaving old activities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>
*   Consumer innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>
*   Social activists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>
*   Evaluators (creating new metrics of success) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>
*   Policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>

Given that systems change often takes 30-40 years, the challenge is to accelerate this process. This involves moving beyond purely emergent models (which leave much to chance) and highly directive, mission-driven models (which assume a known destination, like a moonshot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. The aim is to cultivate "intentional emergence," deliberately synchronizing, complementing, and coordinating multiple commitments from various stakeholders to create a dynamic for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

### Balancing Value Creation and Extraction
[[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | Successful ecosystem initiatives]] focus on balancing the flows of information and aligning incentives towards a [[cocreation_and_stakeholder_engagement_in_mission_setting | shared purpose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. They also encourage autopoiesis (self-regeneration), which requires a "creative underground" (creative forces) and an "open middle ground" (institutions, universities, companies, the existing regime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Recognizing that "context is everything," different interventions are necessary for ecosystems at different stages of their life cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Ultimately, effective stakeholder engagement in innovation ecosystems requires constant adjustment and responsiveness to the environment, fostering an environment where something new is always being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

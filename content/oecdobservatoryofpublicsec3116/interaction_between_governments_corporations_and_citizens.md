The dynamic interplay between governments, corporations, and citizens is crucial for promoting innovation that benefits developing countries and addresses global challenges like poverty and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | multi-stakeholder collaboration]] is essential for sustainable development, especially in the wake of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, which have exacerbated existing inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The Role of Government

Governments play a pivotal role in creating an enabling environment for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Instead of being overly controlling, their function should be to coordinate, facilitate, and nurture innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This means steering rather than rowing, allowing others to drive the innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

Key governmental actions include:
*   **Creating Ecosystems**: Establishing frameworks that support innovation, such as Malaysia's Global Innovation Center, which provides an "innovation sandbox" with funding and mentorship for local innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This includes setting regulations and providing opportunities and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Facilitating Scaling**: Identifying successful grassroots or "positive deviance" innovations and providing resources to help them scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Platform Creation**: Developing digital platforms that bring together innovators and organizations that can help scale solutions, as seen with USAID's Million Lives Club or the Commonwealth Secretariat's platform for member countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic Procurement**: Using public procurement as a powerful incentive for aligning innovation efforts, especially for addressing identified problems like the SDGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Incentives**: Providing incentives and disincentives in budgets to encourage private sector [[collaboration_between_government_and_industry | participation in nation-building and citizen welfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. This can include supporting upskilling and reskilling programs that lead to private sector absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.

## The Role of Citizens and Local Innovators

Innovation is largely local, driven by individuals and communities facing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Citizens are often the true innovators, coming up with solutions to their own problems with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Key aspects of citizen engagement include:
*   **Grassroots Innovation**: Solutions often emerge from the ground up, characterized by "frugal innovation" â€“ doing more and better for more people with fewer resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This involves repurposing and reusing existing resources to create affordable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.
*   **Social Entrepreneurship**: A growing revolution of social enterprises dedicated to solving social problems using business and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **[[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | Co-design and Participation]]**: Citizens can act as co-designers of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. Their direct experience of problems makes them ideal for shaping relevant and contextualized innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Empathy and Local Needs**: Development partners need to stand in the shoes of local governments and communities, being informed and shaped by their values, priorities, and constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.

## The Role of the Private Sector (Corporations)

The private sector, encompassing both large corporations and agile startups, has a significant role in promoting innovation for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.

Key contributions from corporations include:
*   **Shifting Innovation Focus**: Traditional corporate innovation often involved expensive R&D and technology push, leading to high-cost products trickling down to lower-income groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. This approach needs to shift towards "frugal innovation," focusing on highly affordable solutions by reaching large volumes of people, which can still be highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   **Partnerships with Startups**: Large companies can partner with startups that develop early-stage ideas or technologies (e.g., Pfizer and BioNTech for vaccines), providing resources, expertise, funding, and distribution networks to help scale these innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
*   **Investment Capital**: Mobilizing private capital, especially in the form of foreign direct investment, is crucial for closing the financing gap in sustainable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. Blended finance models, combining grant capital with return-seeking capital, can lower risk for investors and grow the overall resourcing pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.
*   **Industry-specific Innovation**: Companies can look at their environmental impact and innovate for more sustainable products, such as biodegradable PPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.

## Ideal State Dynamic: A Collaborative Ecosystem

The ideal dynamic between these three entities is a collaborative ecosystem where each plays a complementary role:
*   **Government as Steerer and Enabler**: Governments create the space and provide incentives (e.g., regulatory sandboxes, procurement) for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. They identify key challenges, such as the SDGs, and create digital platforms to connect diverse players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
*   **Citizens as Innovators and Beneficiaries**: Grassroots innovators and social enterprises develop ingenious, often frugal, solutions tailored to local needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. They are at the heart of the innovation process, ensuring relevance and adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **Corporations as Scalers and Investors**: Large private sector entities leverage their resources, expertise, and market reach to scale promising innovations and integrate them into wider systems, often through partnerships with smaller, agile innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>. They also contribute financially through innovative financing mechanisms beyond traditional grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

This [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | collaborative triangle]] can address complex issues like unemployment by linking government incentives for reskilling with private sector absorption of newly trained individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis has revealed both the potential for innovation and the need to move beyond traditional silos in the development sector, promoting a holistic approach that considers broader impacts like mental health and economic livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. Furthermore, there's a strong call to broaden the [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | innovation conversation]] to include diverse and local innovators, particularly women, who may not be on the international radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

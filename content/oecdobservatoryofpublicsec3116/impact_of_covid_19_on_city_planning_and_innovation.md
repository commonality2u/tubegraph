Cities have been at the forefront of responding to the [[impact_of_covid19_on_global_innovation | COVID-19 pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, not only in containing the virus but also in coordinating efforts to ensure the well-being of their residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The crisis has underscored the critical [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | role of innovation]] in building back better for cities in the [[impact_of_covid19_on_global_innovation | post Covid-19 era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Cities on the Front Line of Response
Cities were particularly affected by the [[impact_of_covid19_on_global_innovation | COVID-19 pandemic]] and were on the front line of response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Their actions included implementing nationwide measures like lockdowns and physical distancing, and providing masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Beyond containment, cities played a critical function in coordinating and ensuring the continuity of local public services such as water, sanitation, solid waste, and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. They also focused on protecting vulnerable groups (elderly, women, youth, migrants), preventing evictions, and supporting small businesses like restaurants and local shops that were severely impacted by the halt in global production and consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

The crisis has revealed and accelerated existing structural inequalities and challenges faced by dense cities, such as housing affordability, traffic congestion, air pollution, urban safety, inequality, and spatial segregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Poll Results
> A survey among participants revealed that 38.1% believe the crisis exposed gaps in city services, infrastructure, and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. This highlights that many previously "invisible" issues were made visible during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.

## Innovation as an Accelerator
The distinctive element of the [[impact_of_covid19_on_global_innovation | COVID-19 crisis]], compared to past pandemics, is the acceleration of [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_transformation_in_the_public_sector | digital transformation]] and [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Massive investment in digital infrastructure allowed for a "digital proximity" to substitute physical proximity, manifesting in online education, telemedicine, e-commerce, and significantly, telework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Telework, in particular, saw a decade's worth of change happen in six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

### Shifting Perceptions and Agility
A key outcome of the pandemic has been a change in perceptions among leaders about what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Things previously deemed impossible due to rules or regulations, such as distance education, were rapidly implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. Cities demonstrated remarkable agility, with local authorities rapidly adapting to new operational models. For example, within days of the first lockdown in London, 95% of local authority staff were working from home, and all 33 boroughs established vulnerability hubs to deliver food and medicine and coordinate volunteers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

This period has shown that decisions can be made and actions taken without lengthy strategy documents, fostering a more tactical approach to urbanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

### Overcoming the Fear of Failure
A significant challenge to [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] in large organizations is the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>. Public institutions often discourage mistakes, hindering experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>. Cities like Helsingborg in Sweden have actively worked to tackle this fear by:
*   **Structuring for ease of navigation**: Creating clear pathways for employees to test and develop ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58:00">[27:58:00]</a>.
*   **Fostering a culture of learning**: Encouraging open discussion about failures and collective learning from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a>.
*   **Rewarding "good" mistakes**: Instituting an "internal award the fail of the year" award, which provides up to 50,000 kroner for competence training to those who make a "really good mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>. The focus is on the lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>.
*   **Building management capabilities**: Training all managers in managing change, transformation, [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]], and [[resilience_and_innovation_in_pandemic_response | resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:52:00">[28:52:00]</a>.

### Political Imagination and Citizen Engagement
[[Public sector innovation during Covid19 | Innovation]] extends beyond technology; it involves political imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>. Mexico City's former innovation lab, with a "chief creative officer" leading a team of urban scientists and humanities experts, emphasized defining the desired future society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:20:00">[33:20:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Political Imagination
> This involves fostering participatory practices and collaboration not just for specific projects, but to collectively ask: "Who do we want to be together? How do we want to live together? What type of societies are how do we want to move together be healthy together?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49:00">[33:49:00]</a>.

The crisis has also highlighted the interdependence of the world at both city and global levels, revealing how externalities, like vulnerable populations, affect the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. This systemic view is crucial for strengthening the "weakest links" in communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Future City Planning
The pandemic has accelerated positive changes but also exacerbated existing inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

### Data and Understanding Reality
While objective, outcome-based data is crucial for demonstrating the value of [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51:00">[48:51:00]</a>, it doesn't always provide the full picture. Cities must also consider subjective, people-centered data that reflects intangible infrastructure and how residents relate to their city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:27:00">[55:27:00]</a>. The "tyranny of the averages" can hide significant disparities within a city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:46:00">[54:46:00]</a>.

### Rethinking Urban Life and Mobility
The shift to teleworking raises questions about the future of metropolitan areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:33:00">[58:33:00]</a>. While virtual collaboration offers benefits like reduced commutes, it also highlights issues of digital inclusion for those without access to connectivity or devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. Cities are grappling with the implications for office spaces and their fiscal capacity tied to businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

The crisis has accelerated a shift from focusing on "mobility" to "accessibility," emphasizing amenities around people rather than constant movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:08:00]</a>. Concepts like the "10-minute city" (Brussels), "15-minute city" (Paris), and "20-minute city" (Melbourne) aim to rethink urban planning and public space around a multi-dimensional concept of well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>. In Mexico City, the recent passing of mobility as a human right at a constitutional level is a world first, accelerated by the pandemic's impact on transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>.

### Fortifying Public Institutions
The pandemic has fostered a renewed appreciation for the importance of public institutions, from health systems to [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | government innovation]] and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>. The focus should be on optimizing for public value, not just efficiency, and challenging the notion that corporations are inherently more efficient than government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

## Inter-governmental Coordination and Multilateralism
Coordination between national, state, and local levels has been a challenge, particularly in contexts like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. National initiatives, while well-intentioned, sometimes failed due to lack of consultation with city governments, leading to wasted time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Cities, knowing their communities best, must be at the heart of policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

[[Impact of COVID19 on global cooperation | City-to-city peer learning]] and collaboration have proven invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. Mayors and city managers facing similar ground-level challenges have found tremendous value in sharing experiences and workarounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. Networks like Bloomberg Philanthropies' Harvard City Leadership Initiative facilitate this dialogue, acting as a "school for mayors" to build a network for sharing information and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.

## Sustaining Innovation Post-Pandemic
[[Public sector innovation during Covid19 | Innovation]] is increasingly seen as a "must-have" rather than a "nice-to-have" in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. While cities often operate on tight budgets, the crisis has highlighted the necessity of dedicated innovation capacity to tackle root causes of problems and transform resident experiences, rather than just putting out daily fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Key Takeaways for the Future
> *   **Prepare for the unexpected**: Focus on building competencies, capabilities, and flexible working methods to face future crises, rather than rigid, detailed plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:26">[0:52:26]</a>.
> *   **Professionalize innovation**: Integrate [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] as a serious, professional function within organizations, akin to HR or communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:53:35">[0:53:35]</a>.
> *   **Balance data with context**: Combine objective, data-driven strategies with qualitative, people-centered approaches to understand complex societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:57:41">[0:57:41]</a>.
> *   **Embrace experimental probes**: Create opportunities for citizens to experience new urban realities, fostering acceptance for changes like pedestrianized streets or bike lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
> *   **Foster interdependency**: De-silo conversations and embrace the understanding of mutual interdependencies within cities and globally to solve complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.
> *   **Document and share outcomes**: Measure the tangible impact of [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] investments on residents' well-being to convince more cities to adopt innovative practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.

The pandemic has created a critical moment to embrace bolder and more ambitious [[innovation_strategies_during_covid19_recovery | innovation strategies during COVID19 recovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. The goal is to build a "symbiotic city" where all parts affect each other positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>, supported by open knowledge systems and international [[impact_of_covid19_on_global_cooperation | global cooperation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.

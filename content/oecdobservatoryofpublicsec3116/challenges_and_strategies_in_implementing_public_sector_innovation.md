## Introduction
[[Innovation in the public sector | Public sector innovation]] is a critical area of focus for governments worldwide, including Canada, which has a long and clear history of interest and an articulated ambition for more innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Despite this, there has been an ongoing struggle to find the right balance between control and allowing for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Governments today must change what they do to stay relevant in an evolving economy and maintain the same level of outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Citizens and public servants alike expect things to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. A government that fails to innovate risks being perpetually behind and disappointing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Innovation needs to be a core competency and a systemic, repeatable, consistent activity, rather than an ad-hoc or reactive one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. To achieve this, it's essential to understand the underlying innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

> A system is defined as "the things that mean that those in the system know what is expected without having to be told" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
>
> An innovation system encompasses "the factors, components, and practices that affect whether and to what extent innovation occurs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | Challenges in Public Sector Innovation]]
Research into the Canadian context revealed several preliminary findings and core understandings about the existing innovation system:

### Fragmented Understanding and Ad-Hoc Nature
*   **Fragmented Understanding**: There is a fragmented understanding of "who, what, and why" regarding innovation within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Innovation is inherently ambiguous and hard to define, leading rational individuals to prioritize clearer, more easily tracked agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This means innovation often comes second unless there is a clear agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Individuals**: [[Challenges in implementing innovation in the public sector | Innovation]] in the public sector often relies on the "right person being in the right place at the right time" rather than the merit of ideas or underlying need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. This makes innovation more about individual navigation of barriers, relying on luck, instead of a strategic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Marginal Activity**: Despite its development, the practice of innovation remains a marginal activity, not viewed as part of core business or "the way things are done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Innovation is about difference, while government traditionally focuses on replication and standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### Systemic Mismatch and Risk Aversion
*   **Unsuited to Context**: There is a mismatch between what can be done inside and outside of government, risking a public service unsuited to its context. If the gap between citizen expectations and government services is too large, it leads to disappointment and negative consequences for the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion**: A significant barrier to [[innovation in public sector | innovation in the public sector]] is a risk-averse organizational culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. Public servants often feel the need for explicit permission to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. This risk aversion is a structural issue across bureaucratic organizations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact**: Measuring the impact of innovation is challenging because it involves doing new things without established standards or performance targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>.

### "Clay Layer" and Lack of Centralization
*   **Middle Management Bottleneck**: Middle management, often referred to as the "clay layer," can act as a bottleneck, filtering information up and down the hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a>.
*   **No Central Agency**: The absence of a central agency responsible for innovation can hinder federal employees from sharing and developing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>.

## [[Public sector innovation methods and strategies | Strategies for Innovation Implementation]]
A model was developed focusing on three levels of analysis: individual, organizational, and system. This model highlights that if system elements are not in place, innovation falls to the organizational level, which operates from siloed perspectives. If organizational elements are also missing, it falls to individuals, who must go "above and beyond" to drive change, which is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:43">[02:21:43]</a>.

The model identifies four core determinants of innovation: clarity, parity, suitability, and normality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:56">[02:09:56]</a>. These are interdependent, meaning a weakness in one can impact the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:56">[02:55:56]</a>.

### 1. Clarity
Clarity refers to a clear signal being sent to system actors about innovation and its fit with other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">[02:27:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>.

*   **Shared Understanding**: Building a shared understanding of what innovation means is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. Denmark's Innovation Barometer, a widespread survey, helps create a common benchmark and agreed definitions across organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:12">[03:09:12]</a>. Canada's Declaration on Public Sector Innovation is a good start in coalescing core concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:26">[03:26:26]</a>.
*   **Relating to Priorities**: Actors must understand innovation in relation to other priorities. France's Manifesto on Public Sector Innovation helps set clear expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:55">[03:19:55]</a>.
*   **Defined Roles**: Clarifying roles within the innovation system is important, recognizing that everyone plays some part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:45">[03:32:45]</a>. Denmark uses "innovation archetypes" to articulate different ways people can participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:58">[03:32:58]</a>. Canada's innovation labs have helped people gain hands-on experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Context**: Connecting innovation to the public service's shared history and context helps integrate it. Emphasizing that innovation has always been part of the journey makes it less alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.

### 2. Parity
Parity ensures that innovation has equal standing with other considerations when proposing actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:55">[03:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:07">[03:05:07]</a>. Unlike the private sector's "marketplace for ideas" driven by profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:56">[02:49:56]</a>, the public sector's signal is often politics, which is changeable and noisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:24">[02:42:24]</a>.

*   **Open Processes**: Processes should be open to challenge, allowing new ideas to compete with incumbent approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:07">[03:12:07]</a>.
*   **Circumventing Bottlenecks**: Strategies to circumvent bottlenecks, such as those caused by middle management, are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:12">[03:15:12]</a>. Online platforms like GCconnects and GCcollab in Canada enable sharing and development of ideas outside traditional hierarchical channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>.
*   **Finding Allies**: Actively seeking allies for innovative ideas can help push them forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:35">[03:16:35]</a>.
*   **Navigating Risk**: There must be a capacity to navigate risk and uncertainty, acknowledging that innovation inherently involves new things without guaranteed answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:22">[03:19:22]</a>.

### 3. Suitability
Suitability focuses on whether the capability systems and infrastructure are appropriate and sufficient for available innovative options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:06">[02:36:06]</a>. Public sector feedback loops often favor what is already understood, making it difficult to invest in emergent possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

*   **Continuous Learning**: Parts of the system must be learning and keeping pace with external change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:40">[03:47:40]</a>.
*   **Technology Socialization**: New technologies need to be socialized within the public service, and leaders must be exposed to them to understand their implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **New Operational Models**: Exploring new operational models is essential. Talent Cloud in Canada is cited as an exciting experiment for a new HR operational model in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   **Tracking Expectations**: The public service needs to keep track of changing citizen and government expectations to drive an appetite for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:17">[03:46:17]</a>.

### 4. Normality
Normality ensures that innovation is seen as integral, rather than an occasionally accepted deviation from the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:14">[02:46:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:39">[02:50:39]</a>.

*   **Supportive Behaviors**: Clear behaviors around supporting innovation are needed, contrasting with the traditional focus on replication and standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Linking to Business**: Efforts should link innovation to regular business activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Socializing and Celebrating**: Innovation should be socialized and celebrated to embed it into the core workings of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Upholding and Defending**: There must be an appetite and ability to uphold and defend innovation, especially when experiments fail or things go wrong, as is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Addressing Specific Challenges with Strategies

### Overcoming Risk Aversion
Public services are inherently risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. The strategy is not to eliminate risk, but to balance it by increasing the perceived risk of *not* innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.
*   **Experimentation Mandate**: Structural forces, like Canada's experimentation direction and commitment, make experimenting acceptable and expected, thereby reducing individual risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Official Declarations**: Documents like the FPT (Federal-Provincial-Territorial) Declaration on Public Sector Innovation in Canada provide broad-based approval for public servants to explore and do things differently, giving "tacit approval" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.
*   **Outcome-Based Payment**: Focusing on achieving specific outcomes, rather than just activities, changes the risk profile. If an outcome isn't reached, payment isn't made, which is argued to be a better risk for the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>. This requires proactive assessment of data and agile implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.
*   **Challenging Convention**: Public servants should refer back to foundational policies and guidelines, which often provide more flexibility than conventional practice suggests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

### Managing Disruptive Change
Disruptive technologies like AI and blockchain pose significant policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Task Forces**: Committees, such as Canada's Deputy Minister Task Force on Public Sector Innovation, are mandated to explore core systems transformation and experiment with disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.
*   **Small-Scale Testing**: Learning lessons through small-scale testing of technologies (e.g., digital identity with blockchain, AI for translation services) allows for adaptation and adoption into government operations in a controlled way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.
*   **Data Strategy**: A foundational data strategy (like Canada's new one) is crucial for effectively collecting and using data to apply disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.

### Overcoming the "Clay Layer"
*   **Forums for Ideas**: Creating platforms and forums where people can circulate, share, and develop ideas to a more sophisticated level *before* requiring formal management attention can circumvent bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>.
*   **Storytelling Skills**: Public servants should develop storytelling skills to tailor their communication to different audiences (e.g., middle management, senior leaders, ministers), addressing their specific concerns (e.g., risk, communications, policy authorities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook
There are no simple answers to [[challenges and opportunities in public sector innovation | public sector innovation]], as it's a dynamic and evolving practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>. The aim is to make the implicit explicit, empowering individuals to see themselves as part of the system and understand the levers they can use to nudge its direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a>.

Suggested areas of opportunity and a speculative "maturity model" for innovation systems are offered as conversation starters to help countries reflect on their aspirations and track progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>. The "innovation facets model" also acknowledges the multi-faceted nature of public sector innovation, requiring different strategies for different forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:37">[01:45:37]</a>. Ultimately, achieving systemic innovation requires a collective effort, with everyone playing a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>.

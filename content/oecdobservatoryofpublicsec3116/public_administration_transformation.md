[[Public administration reform | Public administration reform]] and [[public sector transformation postcrisis | transformation]] are increasingly focusing on co-creation to build inclusive societies and create better futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">00:00:08</a>. The goal is to achieve more robust solutions and garner greater support for decisions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">00:00:22</a>. Co-creation, in this context, involves stakeholders in identifying all dimensions of a problem and designing and implementing solutions through a generative exchange of insights and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">00:03:58</a>. This approach differs significantly from merely informing (announcing decisions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">00:04:47</a> or traditional consultation practices, which often result in "monologues" from different stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">00:05:29</a>. Instead, co-creation facilitates a generative exchange where people come together to discuss and align their paths forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">00:05:33</a>.

## Practical Examples of Co-Creation

### The Circular Plastics Alliance (European Commission)

Ian Anderson, a participatory innovation advisor, shared an example from his decades of experience in the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">00:01:45</a>. The Circular Plastics Alliance aimed to recycle 10 million tons of used plastic into new products annually by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">00:08:56</a>. This complex systemic problem required collaboration across the entire value chain, including chemical producers, product designers, consumers, waste collectors, recyclers, and public authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">00:09:05</a>. Instead of legislating, the Commission proposed an alliance where members of the value chain co-created solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">00:09:56</a>.

Key aspects of this co-creation process:
*   **Generative Exchange** Building trust was central, allowing opinions to be "ground" against each other so participants understood diverse viewpoints and collaborated on solutions rather than competing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">00:12:21</a>.
*   **Structured Participation** Meetings were fully participatory, using classic techniques like World Cafe and Open Space Technology, with each meeting designed from the ground up based on identified needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">00:11:07</a>. Everything was meticulously scripted, yet participants felt complete freedom to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">00:12:05</a>.
*   **Transparency** There were no secret meetings; everything was open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">00:12:18</a>.
*   **Adaptability to Online Formats** While in-person interactions built initial trust, the transition to online during COVID-19 was straightforward for established groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">00:13:39</a>. Online methods increased reach, involving people who might not have been able to travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">00:14:42</a>.

### Innovative.si (Slovenian Public Administration)

Matja≈æ Kodra shared Slovenia's "innovative.si" project, which aims to creatively resolve complex social challenges and provide knowledge and competences for new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">00:15:46</a>. Their vision is to strengthen [[public sector innovation and government transformation | innovation culture]] within [[public administration reform | public administration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">00:15:56</a>.

Key elements of their approach:
*   **Social Platform** Matching [[public sector challenges and transformations | challenges in the public sector]] with internal or external facilitators to navigate co-creative problem-solving processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">00:16:20</a>. Public sector employees are often part of the facilitation team to learn methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">00:16:38</a>.
*   **User Involvement** Active involvement of users in design from the very beginning is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">00:16:58</a>.
*   **Innovation Community Platform** This platform fosters networking, learning, and support, and transfers good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">00:17:41</a>. With over 400 members from public, private, and academic sectors, it hosts regular monthly events using methods like workshops and hackathons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">00:18:04</a>.
*   **Innovative Ambassadors** Individuals actively participating in the innovation community and their work environments, serving as entry points and promoters of co-creative problem-solving in their institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">00:18:19</a>. There are currently 70 ambassadors across ministries and agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">00:18:35</a>.

### CO-GO Digital Toolkit for Public Administrations

Sanja Verbeek, a researcher, introduced the CO-GO digital toolkit, developed by an international consortium to provide holistic support for public organizations implementing co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">00:20:09</a>. This toolkit aims to transform [[public administration reform | public administrations]] into more [[innovative_public_administration_practices | innovative]], open, and collaborative spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">00:21:05</a>.

The toolkit comprises four tools used consecutively:
1.  **CO-READY** Helps public servants assess their organization's readiness for co-creation through a self-evaluation questionnaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">00:21:51</a>. It provides an assessment score and a roadmap with ideas and best practices to improve areas of low readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">00:22:25</a>.
2.  **CO-SERVE** Guides organizations in determining which public service is most suitable for renewal through co-creation, based on service features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">00:23:51</a>.
3.  **CO-NEW** Actively includes service users in the service renewal process, building on user journey mapping to help users voice problems and suggest improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">00:24:50</a>.
4.  **CO-MASTER** Allows organizations to assess the quality of co-creation that took place during service renewal, identifying areas for future improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">00:25:34</a>.

## Key Preconditions and Challenges for Transformation

### Mindset and Skills
*   **Hierarchical Mindset** A significant barrier to engaging stakeholders in co-creating policies and services is a hierarchical mindset within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">00:35:03</a>.
*   **Lack of Participatory Knowledge & Skills** Governments often lack the necessary knowledge, skills, and tools for participatory processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">00:35:06</a>.
*   **"Holding Space" vs. Control** Indi Johar emphasizes that "holding space" for co-creation is a fundamentally different skill than project management, which typically recruits for control-oriented individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">00:49:19</a>. It requires high levels of emotional intelligence and social presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">00:49:42</a>.
*   **Systemic Shift in Recruitment** A rebalancing of capabilities at the department level is needed, potentially through new recruitment strategies rather than just training those accustomed to control-oriented programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">00:50:00</a>.
*   **Learning Capacity** Co-creation is also about building a learning capacity within the system, where every partner is learning, forming a "learning community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">00:30:18</a>.

### Political Backing and Legitimacy
*   **Clear Purpose** Political backing and momentum are essential to ensure a clear purpose for the process, allowing participants to help define the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">00:37:05</a>.
*   **Project Ownership** Successful outcomes are more likely when the project owner or sponsor is committed to co-creation and has the mandate to implement solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">00:42:58</a>.
*   **Constructing Legitimacy** When moving off traditional policymaking tracks, it's crucial to ensure legitimacy, ethical integrity, and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">00:29:33</a>. The soft power unleashed in co-creation requires tight scripting and openness to prevent collusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">00:29:54</a>.
*   **Politicians' Role** Politicians should hold space and be part of the learning journey rather than being expected to provide all answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">00:33:52</a>.
*   **Beyond Community Interest** Public officials must also "provoke" and challenge community interests to ensure the public interest is served, as these are not always the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">01:04:16</a>.

### Organizational Structure and Process
*   **Time Consumption** While co-creation can be time-consuming initially, the subsequent implementation and public acceptance are significantly more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">00:38:00</a>.
*   **Authenticity and Trust** Organizations must be authentic in their engagement, meaning what they say and respecting the process entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">00:39:06</a>.
*   **Early Engagement** Engaging stakeholders early on in the policy cycle increases support and prevents later obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">00:40:15</a>.
*   **Dealing with Complexity** For complex challenges, participation and co-creation are vital for sharing diverse views, findings, knowledge, and experience to create sustainable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">00:42:06</a>. The ability to judge the complexity of each challenge is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">00:42:47</a>.
*   **Overcoming Silos** A lack of silos within an organization is a favorable structural feature for co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">00:48:19</a>.
*   **Transparency and Open Documentation** Working "out loud" through transparent processes, open documentation of learning, and regular reflections helps factor in input and allows for challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">01:04:46</a>. This openness also acts as a protection against undue lobbyist influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">01:11:15</a>.

### Impact of Crises and Future Considerations
*   **Crisis as Opportunity** Crises like COVID-19 highlight that traditional policymaking processes are not fast or [[agility_and_transformation_in_the_public_sector | agile]] enough for "long emergencies," necessitating a different, iterative, and parametric policy mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">00:54:20</a>. This requires [[adapting_public_administration_for_digital_transformation | rewiring of government]] and fundamentally different communication and participation with the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">00:54:59</a>.
*   **Involving Future Generations** A structural challenge for co-creation is the current exclusion of future generations, despite their significant potential impact from present decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">00:30:43</a>.
*   **Redefining Decision-Making** The ability of societies to make decisions together in a complex, emerging world with legitimacy is fundamentally broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">00:31:25</a>. This requires a structural reboot of institutional frameworks to enable co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">00:32:04</a>.
*   **Institutionalizing Care** For co-creation to succeed, public administration needs to institutionalize "care," meaning it must be open to open-ended questions and outcomes, recognizing the critical role of others in delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">00:51:46</a>.

Ultimately, [[public sector digital transformation | public administration transformation]] through co-creation is not a "recipe" but depends on a constellation of factors, requiring critical assessment and adaptation within each unique organizational context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">01:09:40</a>. It demands continuous effort in building skills, fostering motivation, networking, and providing ongoing support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">01:00:21</a>.

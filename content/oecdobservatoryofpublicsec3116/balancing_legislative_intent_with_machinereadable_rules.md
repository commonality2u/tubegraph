The concept of [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | rules as code]] is transforming how governments approach rule-making, moving beyond traditional human communication and natural language versions to include machine-consumable forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This shift, described as "re-thinking one of the core functions of government and the state," involves creating an official version of rules that can be understood and acted upon by computer systems consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

While coded rules already exist in various forms – for example, in tax return platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a> – the emerging approach emphasizes conceiving and creating [[machinereadable_data_and_emerging_technologies | machine-consumable]] rules from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. This strategic, deliberate, and systemic approach profoundly changes *when, how, why*, and *for whom* rules are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

## The Need for Rules as Code

### Addressing the Translation Gap
A significant motivation for [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | rules as code]] stems from the "major issues of translation gap" between written legislation and its implementation on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. This gap is common and can lead to substantial issues, such as mispaying people due to misinterpreted rules or inconsistent application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. Traditionally, lawyers act as "very expensive and quite variable modems" translating analog formats (legislation) into digital formats (software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. This process often results in limited reuse, conflicting interpretations, and a lack of assurance regarding how rules are being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

### Enhancing Policy Modeling and Compliance
[[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | Rules as code]] can enable greater and more accurate policy modeling by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This allows for testing the impact of potential legal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. By understanding rules through computer systems consistently, governments can improve compliance and make it easier for people to understand their rights and obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Adapting to a Digital, Complex World
The world is increasingly complex and digital. Policy development often occurs in silos, lacking input from service designers, technologists, end-users, or data experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. This can lead to rules that are ill-suited for purpose, as exemplified by a regulation allowing open Wi-Fi on heart monitors, which could endanger lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>.
Furthermore, machines are increasingly "users" of rules, not just humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. Unlike people, machines are not responsive to legal, financial, or criminal pressures, necessitating rules designed for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. Without clear rules, AI will interpret them according to its own internal logic, potentially leading to unintended and unfair outcomes, such as valuing money more than human lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

### Closing the Policy-Implementation Chasm
There is a "chasm" between policy and implementation, where "a lot of stuff falls into that chasm and never comes out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. This lack of line of sight means policymakers may not know if their intent is met, and implementers may not know the original intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. Rules as code, as part of a broader transformation, aims to create a continuum, enabling rapid iteration and response to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.

## The Challenge of Balancing Legislative Intent and Flexibility

A common concern with [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | rules as code]] is the perceived conflict between legislative intent and the need for flexibility in interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. Law, by its nature, cannot encompass every conceivable situation and evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. There's a risk of creating a "technocratic fantasy" that aims to automate everything, including areas requiring human discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.

### Not Automating Judgment
It is crucial to understand that [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | rules as code]] is not about automating judgment, justice, or complex decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. It's about codifying algorithms, not about machine learning based on jurisprudence that could repeat past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>. The goal is to free up civil servants from easily automatable tasks so they can focus on complex cases requiring their intelligence and discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

### Balancing Prescriptive and Principles-Based Rules
The discussion also highlights a past shift towards principles-based policy, moving away from prescriptive rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>. [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | Rules as code]] emphasizes restoring balance: where clear, consistent implementation is desired, prescriptive rules are helpful; where interpretation is needed, it should be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. Neither approach is fit for all circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

## Approaches to Achieving Balance

### Co-Drafting and Multi-Disciplinary Teams
The ideal future state involves co-drafting policy intent, concept models, logic flow, and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>. This means simultaneously creating human and machine-readable rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. This process offers a chance to achieve a better human draft and test it in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>. To achieve this, it is essential to break down silos and integrate multi-disciplinary teams, including economists, developers, policy officers, service designers, and end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

### Iterative and Test-Driven Policy Development
The traditional policy cycle is often linear and lacks iteration, testing, or co-design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | Rules as code]] supports a shift to an iterative, test-driven approach to policy. This involves identifying opportunities, learning, ideating, prototyping, and testing policies before scaling and implementing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Such an approach ensures high confidence in the policy intent being realized through implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.

### Incremental Implementation and Use Cases
Starting small with specific use cases that have a clear need for [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | rules as code]] is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. Examples include improving access to social benefits, simplifying tax compliance for small companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>, or enabling better scrutiny of budget bills by parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. These concrete applications, such as the French *OpenFisca* software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>, demonstrate the potential impact and build momentum, rather than relying on abstract notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.

### Transparency and Accountability
A critical aspect of [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | rules as code]] is increasing transparency. By publishing codes and policies for public consultation, civil society, hackers, and researchers can scrutinize algorithms and propose amendments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. This fosters trust and ensures explainability and access to justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. An authoritative source of [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | rules as code]] (e.g., via APIs) would allow businesses and civil services to branch off, promoting a "[[government_as_a_platform | government as a platform]]" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.

### Organizational Change and Mind Shift
Implementing [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | rules as code]] requires a "mind shift" and significant organizational change within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. This involves changing the "very basic organization of the government itself" to be more impact-driven and user-centric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. It also means engaging with "street level civil servants" who exercise discretion and ensuring their intelligence is harnessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.

### Fairness and Traceability
The claim that [[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | rules as code]] makes things less fair is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. In fact, it can improve fairness by providing full traceability between the law and its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>. By capturing the law and data points at the moment a decision is made, it enables easier appeals and audits of decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. This is critical for accountability in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[rules_as_code_and_its_implications_for_governance | Rules as code]] is not merely a technocratic solution, but a fundamental shift in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. It is about "rule-making for humans and machines," ensuring rules are both understandable and transparent to citizens, while also being actionable by the increasing presence of [[machinereadable_data_and_emerging_technologies | machines]] in our physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. By embracing multidisciplinary approaches, iterative development, and a focus on transparency, governments can bridge the policy-implementation gap and build a more resilient, effective, and responsive public sector fit for the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

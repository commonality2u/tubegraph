From: [[oecdobservatoryofpublicsec3116]] <br/> 

The recent global crisis has provided critical insights into the preparedness and adaptability of health systems worldwide, highlighting both vulnerabilities and areas of unexpected strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This period has revealed what systems should abandon, what practices to retain, and what new approaches to adopt to build future resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The objective is to contribute to a "call to action" for governments and stakeholders, fostering [[postpandemic_institutional_changes_and_future_preparedness | institutional changes]] that enhance preparedness for future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Initial Readiness and Rapid Adaptation

While many countries faced significant challenges, an unprecedented pace of change was observed, particularly in technology adoption, staff redeployment, and behavioral change communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Country Experiences:

*   **Latvia**
    *   Despite being one of the least funded health systems in the EU, Latvia achieved a "miracle" by reorganizing and utilizing its best resources, particularly its strong epidemiological services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Successful cooperation with private services dramatically increased testing capacities in a very short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This highlights that people are often more innovative than institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Ireland**
    *   Ireland's public health system was not ready to absorb the scale of change, facing a shortage of critical care beds and being in the midst of a new health reform program (*Sl√°intecare*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
    *   Significant work was required to build surge capacity for critical and acute beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   Success was largely attributed to the willingness of all staff, especially nurses, to undertake training and support surge preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Challenges included recruiting staff for testing and scaling back primary/community services to redeploy resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Korea**
    *   Korea's relative success stemmed from three key factors:
        1.  **Diagnostic Capacity**: Early enhancement of PCR testing capabilities, allowing for over 25,000 tests per day, ensuring all exposed and suspected patients could be tested quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
        2.  **Existing Data Infrastructure**: Leveraging the national health insurance system (100% population coverage) and advanced information infrastructure, such as the drug utilization system. This enabled clinicians to track patient travel history and facilitated a mask distribution system to prevent panic buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Credit card and CCTV information were also used for epidemiological investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
        3.  **Governance of Relevant Organizations**: All relevant organizations, including local governments, were linked under a central disaster management headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   Past experience with MERS in 2015 led to the building of a [[role_of_systems_thinking_in_crisis_management | crisis management system]] and improved hospital infection control systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Public behavior, such as widespread facial mask use, also played a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This highlights that [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilience and preparedness]] are linked to pre-existing healthcare delivery systems and universal operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Sweden**
    *   Sweden was well-prepared to scale up capacity, doubling ICU capacity and maintaining availability from the pandemic's outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
    *   A significant leap was made in creating a digitalized health system, delivering services through new digital ways for follow-up visits, monitoring, prescriptions, and consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
    *   Accurate information and high public trust were key to fighting the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
    *   The crisis fostered tight collaboration within a previously fragmented health system, an investment Sweden aims to sustain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. The pandemic provided a single clear goal for the health system, simplifying collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
*   **Israel**
    *   Despite a tight health budget and a thinly stretched healthcare system, Israel was familiar with emergencies and had a long-standing pandemic contingency plan that had been drilled multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
    *   Key helpful aspects included:
        1.  **Proactive protection of the elderly and high-risk groups**: Intensive efforts to inform vulnerable populations to stay home and protect patients in their homes and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
        2.  **Early mass diagnostic testing**: Free-of-charge, large-scale PCR testing at one of the highest global rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.
        3.  **Timely adaptation of hospital care**: Early understanding that ventilation was not always ideal, along with appropriate supportive care and proning, contributed to low case fatality rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
        4.  **Rapid transition to online care**: Leveraging existing digital health infrastructure to focus on chronic disease management and proactive preventive medicine from afar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.

## Managing the "Double Burden"

The initial response to the pandemic often involved hospitals largely cancelling non-emergency services to focus on COVID-19, leading to an increase in mortality from other conditions like heart attacks and strokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. In the second wave, countries tried to maintain non-emergency services.

### Adaptations and Challenges:

*   **Latvia**:
    *   During spring, all planned services were immediately closed, impacting accessibility and worsening already long waiting lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.
    *   In the current wave, the goal is to keep healthcare open as long as possible by reorganizing designated COVID-19 beds and reducing ambulatory care, rather than planned care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.
    *   A significant challenge is the shortage of healthcare workers, who often work in multiple places, making it difficult to apply strict safety measures without shutting down half the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Efforts are underway to develop home healthcare services, including oxygen monitoring and leveraging general practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   **Ireland**:
    *   The backlog of non-COVID care is a challenge due to self-isolating staff and weariness among frontline workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.
    *   e-health solutions, such as telehealth in GP practices and OPD clinics, and electronic transfer of prescriptions, have been rapidly implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
    *   A COVID-19 tracker tracing app was rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
    *   Community support initiatives and increased well-being budgets (from 6 million to 20 million) are aiding prevention and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.
*   **Sweden**:
    *   Sweden explicitly avoided a full lockdown to protect the broader health system and prevent negative health impacts (e.g., kept schools open) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
    *   Statistics show no increase in suicidal rates or mental health illness so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
    *   In the first wave, resources were reallocated, leading to halted screening programs and elective surgeries. Many patients also avoided scheduled appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.
    *   In the second wave, the health system has "bounced back quite quickly," and elective surgery is largely back on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
    *   The health workforce is tired, but applications for doctor and nurse programs have increased by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
    *   There is an increased need to invest in preventive measures and public health to tackle waiting times, not just by performing more surgical interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.
*   **Israel**:
    *   In the first wave, Israel faced similar problems of focusing solely on COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
    *   The second wave was handled "completely differently" and "pretty well." Hospitals did not stop elective procedures, and community-focused care, including primary health care, preventive medicine, and proactive care by GPs, continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.
    *   Predictive, proactive approaches were developed to identify patients at high risk of deterioration from various conditions, leading to targeted outreach by physicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Korea**:
    *   Even without a total lockdown, during periods of high prevalence, Korea faced shortages of hospital beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.
    *   The government implemented a three-level care facility system: general hospitals for severe COVID-19, "living care centers" for low-level care, and home isolation with regular checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
    *   Patient movement tracks were totally separated for COVID-19, other respiratory diseases, and other conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
    *   A 30-day mortality assessment for myocardial infarction showed no increase within this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>.

## Designing Better Public Health Systems Post-Crisis

The crisis has underscored that public health is a complex public policy issue, inextricably linked to the economy, jobs, education, and public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

### Key Learnings and Future Directions:

*   **Integration and Holistic Approach**:
    *   **Ireland**: Increased public health funding by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. The *Sl√°intecare* reform aims to deliver health in the right place at the right time. Alternative approaches like e-medicine, online consultations, and electronic prescriptions are being pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. Wellness initiatives, community support (e.g., "Keep Well" campaign, local authorities, sporting organizations), and prevention of illnesses are priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. The crisis has created a window of opportunity for health services to feel empowered and for the public to show appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
    *   **Latvia**: The pandemic offers an opportunity to end the "health vs. economy" false dilemma. Adequate response to pandemics involves implementing a [[challenges_and_improvements_in_public_health_systems | universal health care approach]] and prioritizing health promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. Health systems only impact about 20% of population health; other factors like well-being, household situation, and environmental issues are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. Politicians often struggle to follow expert advice on tough decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. A key commitment for the future is tackling inequalities, as economic vulnerability directly impacts adherence to public health measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.
    *   **Korea**: The crisis made people realize the need to redesign the health system towards a more public sector dominant model, focusing on "human security" beyond just patient safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. All health issues are deeply linked with other sectors of human security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. The importance of healthcare resources and delivery for infectious diseases, alongside epidemiological testing and public health, was realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>. Building a sound healthcare delivery system and ensuring universal health coverage are critically important for [[building_resilient_and_adaptive_government_systems | resilient and prepared]] health systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>.
*   **Acceleration of Existing Trends vs. Rethinking Directions**:
    *   **Sweden**: The crisis largely accelerated ongoing trends like digitalization, patient-centeredness, and health system collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. However, it also forced a rethinking of preparedness systems (e.g., supplies) and the need for greater adaptability to new situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. There's a new learning about the need for faster adaptation and better collaboration with civil society and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>. Personally, the director general will speed up processes, increase the use of health data, and provide clearer, more focused messages for the healthcare sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.
    *   **Israel**: The pandemic was the "best accelerator of digital health," overcoming years of resistance and bureaucratic hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. Digital health is now inseparable from healthcare, with a new equilibrium expected where more care is provided online (both synchronous and asynchronous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. The concept of digital transformation as a redesign of care processes augmented by technology is now fully embraced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. There is a hopeful realization that maintaining a barely sustainable healthcare system has significant economic tolls, necessitating safety margins for future pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>. A key commitment for the future is to remember that the crisis is "not over until it's over," avoiding hubris and maintaining vigilance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.

## Impact on Population Behavior

The question of whether general population behavior will change due to the pandemic (e.g., related to obesity, smoking, alcohol use, which increase risks for both non-communicable and infectious diseases) is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>.

*   **Korea**: While acute diseases saw decreased elective surgery, the use of medical services by chronic disease patients increased slightly, suggesting that the pandemic did not negatively impact their care-seeking behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.
*   **Ireland**: Significant opportunities exist as people working from home have more family time, reflecting on life's priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>. An interesting trend observed is an increase in people depositing money into their bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.

## International Collaboration

The pandemic has definitively shown that national responses alone are insufficient to deal with global problems; international collaboration, such as with the EU and WHO, is crucial for better preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

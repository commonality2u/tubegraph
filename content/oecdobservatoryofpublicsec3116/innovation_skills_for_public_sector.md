This article provides an introduction to [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] and problem framing, as viewed by the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) within the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## What is Innovation?

There isn't a single, specific definition of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation in the public sector]] because it's highly dependent on context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. What is innovative in one country or organization might not be in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

However, OPSI has identified three common factors of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>:
*   **Novelty** It introduces new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Implementation** Having creative ideas is only part of the process; implementation is a core focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Impact** The implementation must have an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Measuring impact can be challenging, especially when doing something genuinely new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Why Public Sector Innovation is Needed

The public sector needs [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] due to several factors:
*   **Changing Functions** The world is constantly changing, leading to expectations that government services adapt as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Service Gap** There's often a gap between private sector services and public sector services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Governments are working hard just to maintain this gap, rather than closing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **No Room for Spectators** Governments need to engage everyone in [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] efforts, not just specialists in labs or training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Everyone should understand how to engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Increasing Demands** Citizens and politicians expect more from government services as technology advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. A mismatch between expectations and delivery can lead to issues with government value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Core Competency** [[Innovation in public sector management | Innovation]] needs to be embedded as a core competency throughout government to enable better responses to crises and evolving needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Ways to View Innovation

OPSI views [[types_and_purposes_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] in three distinct ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>:
1.  **Delivering on Today** Mission-driven innovation that produces better value based on current goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
2.  **Delivering on Tomorrow** Anticipatory [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] that considers future trends like AI or blockchain to innovate today for tomorrow's challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
3.  **Ensuring Readiness** Building capacity and capability to innovate when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Core Innovation Skills

Beyond core job-specific skills, certain "skill areas" are crucial for thinking differently and achieving different results in [[Innovation in the public sector | the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>:
*   **Iteration** The ability to do things quickly, cheaply, and with reduced risk to get feedback faster and achieve better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Canada's "experiment mandate" is an example of pushing iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Data Literacy** Understanding how data can provide insights into problems and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **User Centricity** Placing the end-user at the center of the design process for services and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This contrasts with traditional government approaches that focus on internal process efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Co-designing with users helps break down barriers between policy and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Curiosity** Asking questions and looking for new ways of doing things, including horizon scanning for cutting-edge practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Storytelling** The ability to tell a compelling, short, concise, and memorable story that resonates with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Insurgency** Questioning the status quo and trying new ways of doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Insurgents, though sometimes perceived as difficult, can be the best source for identifying what's wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

### Abilities, Opportunities, and Motivation (AMO) Model
Possessing these skills is important, but individuals also need the **opportunity** to practice them and the **motivation** or incentive to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## Innovation Lifecycle: Problem Framing

OPSI has developed a six-step [[types_of_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | innovation]] lifecycle:
1.  **Identifying Problems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>
2.  **Generating Ideas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>
3.  **Developing Proposals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>
4.  **Implementing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>
5.  **Evaluating** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>
6.  **Diffusing** (sharing lessons learned, including failures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>

This lifecycle is not linear; steps may be revisited as new information emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### The Importance of Problem Framing
The GE MRI machine example illustrates the power of reframing a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Instead of focusing on the MRI machine's design flaws or sedation rates, GE reframed the issue as the "experience of using the MRI machine" for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This led to a simple, low-cost solution (telling stories during scans) that drastically reduced the need for sedation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

The **Double Diamond design methodology** emphasizes spending significant time in the "problem space" (discovering and defining the problem) before moving to the "solution space" (developing and delivering solutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. However, public servants often skip the problem definition stage, jumping straight to solutions or implementing pre-defined solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. This can lead to disappointment and a lack of impact because the root problem was not addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

### Why Governments Struggle with Problem Framing
*   **Pressure for Quick Responses** Governments prioritize immediate solutions over finding the right solution, often addressing symptoms rather than root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
*   **Complexity and Intimidation** As new information emerges and problems are analyzed, they can become large, complex, and unwieldy, leading to intimidation or exceeding one's scope of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Evolving Problems** Problems can change or evolve into completely new issues, requiring continuous re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

### Tips for Better Problem Framing
New information should trigger a series of questions to better frame the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>:
*   What is known? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>
*   What is possible? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>
*   What is expected? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>
*   What is actually needed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>
*   What is the problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>

Key strategies for effective problem framing include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>:
*   **Clarifying Intent** Defining what is truly being attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Making Assumptions Explicit** Differentiating facts from assumptions to challenge and verify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Jumping to Conclusions** Resisting the urge to immediately move to solutions after a brief analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
*   **Connecting with Others** Being inclusive and collaborative by bringing in diverse perspectives to broaden understanding of the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.
*   **Reframing the Problem** Approaching the problem from different perspectives to facilitate new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.
*   **Experimentation** Using experiments in the problem space to better understand the problem, not just to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

### Common Problem Identification Tools and Strategies
*   **Dashboards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a> (provide data but don't explain the "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>)
*   **Horizon Scanning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a> (looking at what's happening elsewhere, e.g., other organizations or countries)
*   **Design Thinking/Human-Centered Design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a> (designing experiences, services, and products to fit citizen needs)
*   **Systems Thinking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a> (understanding the complete lens of all actors to fully grasp the problem)
*   **Behavioral Insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a> (understanding how people behave and make decisions)
*   **Peer-to-Peer Learning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a> (working with peers and networks facing similar challenges)
*   **Learning Organizations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a> (constantly seeking new methods within an organization)
*   **Innovation Labs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a> (dedicated spaces for innovation, with various structures)

### The Five Whys Exercise
This simple exercise involves defining a problem and then repeatedly asking "why" it's happening to gain a deeper understanding of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. For example, a US government agency trying to improve customer satisfaction learned that customers found them "too complex" and "too slow." By asking "why" repeatedly, they discovered the root cause was a confusing website, which was easily tweaked to improve satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges in Innovation

### Leadership and Adoption
Leadership's evolution in [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] moves from skepticism, to talk without real change, to limited project-based innovation, to finally embracing that ideas can come from anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Practitioners are encouraged to focus on what they can directly control or influence, even if it's just a small part of a larger process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. Sending leaders to [[developing_leadership_skills_for_public_sector_innovation | innovation training]] can help them understand concepts like iteration and prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>.

### Conservative Culture and Risk Aversion
Most public sectors are conservative and risk-averse due to political issues, media scrutiny, or a fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>. Innovators need resiliency, a willingness to push despite stumbling blocks, and a network of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. The traditional government model of five-year plans and exhaustive analysis often leads to costly failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. The alternative is to quickly and cheaply test multiple solutions to gain information, even if they fail, leading to better-informed larger investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.

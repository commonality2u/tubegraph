Governments are increasingly exploring innovative approaches to foster youth engagement and ensure their voices are heard in policy-making processes. A notable example is the "Future Mentors Program" piloted by the City of Espoo, Finland, which exemplifies a novel approach to [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | citizen participation in policy making]] by reversing traditional mentorship roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

## The Future Mentors Program

The Future Mentors Program is a reversed mentoring initiative where small groups of young people actively mentor decision-makers from their own cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. The program's core aim is to bridge the gap between youth and decision-makers at the local level, fostering dialogue and mutual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

The City of Espoo's mayor emphasizes that "active and included youth is the best asset to a future proof City" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, reflecting the underlying philosophy that young people, whose future is significantly impacted by today's decisions, should have a voice in these discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

### How it Works

The mentoring sessions are led by the young "future mentors" and focus on themes they deem important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. Young mentors are tasked with contemplating their hopes, dreams, and fears concerning the sustainable future of their home city, which they then discuss with their mentee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

The process unfolds locally within each city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>:
1.  Young people apply to the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
2.  They conduct pre-research among local youth to gain a broader perspective on their peers' hopes and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
3.  Mentors develop their ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.
4.  They engage in dialogue with a decision-maker during mentoring sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

Each city also designates a coordinator to facilitate the process and support the young mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. The pilot program included a virtual platform for networking and peer support among mentors, alongside online sessions with sustainable development experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

### Scale and Scope

The program can be implemented at a single-city, national, or even international level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. The international pilot added wider perspective and peer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. For the pilot, one mentor from each participating city traveled to the Eurocities conference in Espoo to further work on topics with city leaders and integrate the youth perspective into the conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

A comprehensive manual, "Future Mentors Manual and Step-by-Step Guide," provides detailed instructions for running the program locally, along with communication materials and results from the pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. These materials are freely available for any organization to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### Pilot Results

The first round of the program involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>:
*   94 mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>
*   26 cities from the Eurocities Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>
*   26 decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>
*   26 coordinators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>

During the program, youth discussed their dreams and fears for the future of their cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. Common topics included [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | public participation]], public transport, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. Their fears largely revolved around the climate crisis, unemployment, inequality, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

At the Eurocities conference, mentors presented six key recommendations for involving young people at local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. These included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>:
*   Compulsory and non-tokenistic youth engagement in decisions that affect them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
*   Creating a youth department or university to ensure young people are always part of the university's network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   Regular (at least twice a year) communication between city leaders and youth representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
*   [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | Inclusive and accessible engagement]] with young people, with extra care to include those from disadvantaged backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
*   Sufficient resources to support youth and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.
*   Constant evaluation and feedback gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>.

Feedback from both mentors and mentees indicated general satisfaction with the program, viewing it as an effective way to involve young people in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

### Impact and Future Directions

The Future Mentors Program has already achieved tangible impacts, including the establishment of youth councils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. Participating cities (93%) expressed interest in continued collaboration on youth participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. The program was also shortlisted for the Finnish National Education Agency's best youth participation practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>, particularly praised because themes are decided by the young participants themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. At least one city has already organized its own program after the pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.

This initiative is a compelling example of how governments can actively transform their engagement with citizens, fostering a stronger sense of [[trust_and_engagement_in_public_governance | trust and engagement]] and ensuring that policy-making is responsive to the needs and perspectives of all generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

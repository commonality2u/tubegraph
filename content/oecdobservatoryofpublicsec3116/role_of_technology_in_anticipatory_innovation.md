Technology is a significant influence on the environmental changes governments and public organizations face daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. It introduces new and different elements that demand an adequate response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## The Collingridge Dilemma

A key challenge related to technology is the "Collingridge dilemma," which impacts the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. In the early stages of technological development, the possibility of controlling change is much greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. However, as innovation develops and evidence of its potential impacts becomes clearer, the ability to control or influence it diminishes significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

For instance, at the start of platform economies like Uber in the transportation industry, influencing their development was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Yet, once an innovation has millions of users, it becomes very difficult to reverse or change it, even when adverse effects (e.g., related to climate change or emissions) become evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This means governments must consider technological and non-technological changes early on to influence values and potential impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Beyond the Technology Silo

While innovation is often seen as a discipline related solely to technology, it is increasingly multi- and transdisciplinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. Governments often create a "digital silo" or "technology silo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. However, technology's design inherently has both flaws and opportunities that influence how humans interact with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

To adequately anticipate, it's crucial to:
*   **Consider Human and System Design** When examining technology, one must look at its function from a human-centric or system-centric design perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.
*   **Understand Societal Impact** Digitalization, for example, simultaneously allows for centralization and personalization/decentralization of services, leading to fundamental rippling effects on human contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.
*   **Recognize Technology as a Tool** Human and social contexts drive the need for different technological solutions and choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>. Technology plays an instrumental role in achieving goals or "preferable futures" but should not be a goal in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>. For example, a smart city vision should prioritize seamless services and addressing inequality, rather than simply accumulating technological choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>.
*   **Adopt a Balanced Perspective** An "anticipatory" approach requires looking at technology from both its inherent characteristics and its human/social implications to avoid a skewed point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

## Building [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] around Technology

Governments and organizations must build and manage [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance | anticipatory]] ecosystems around different technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. This includes understanding how technological characteristics will play out in human contexts and affect society, leading to proactive choices and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.

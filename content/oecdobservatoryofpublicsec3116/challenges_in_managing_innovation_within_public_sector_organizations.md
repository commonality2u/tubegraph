Managing innovation within public sector organizations presents unique challenges due to their inherent characteristics and the specific demands placed upon them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. While innovation portfolios exist within the public sector, they are often not formally acknowledged, stewarded, or thought about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Lack of Formalized Portfolio Management
One significant challenge is the general absence of structured innovation portfolio management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. Public sector organizations are often project-oriented but lack occasions where innovation projects are steered or reviewed collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. This often results in a "huge gap" in addressing whether projects are genuinely contributing to organizational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>.

### Lack of Dedicated Responsibility
Effective portfolio management requires someone to be responsible for collecting and making sense of innovation information, and periodically reviewing it to ensure alignment with strategic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. Without dedicated time and space for these activities, efforts can "fall under the radar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>.

### Difficulty in Defining Innovation
A fundamental challenge is gaining a shared understanding of what "innovation" truly means across a diverse organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>. Staff often question if their current activities are innovative enough to be included in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. While a project should be novel to its context, implemented, and have an impact on public value, defining "how innovative it is" often needs internal clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

## Balancing Different Types of Innovation
Public sector organizations have different purposes and aims, meaning their innovation portfolios will inherently be "unbalanced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. For example, a caregiving organization may focus heavily on adaptive innovation, while a space agency would be more mission-oriented or anticipatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. The challenge lies in consciously stewarding these different types to meet specific aims and avoid "lock-ins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.

### Risk Aversion and Statutory Responsibilities
Public bodies, often funded by taxpayers, must balance the need for innovation with statutory responsibilities around regulation and enforcement, which can be risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. This tension makes it difficult to "experiment more" and move into more uncertain, anticipatory innovation spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

### Challenges in Resource Allocation and Procurement
Innovation projects often face hurdles related to resource allocation and procurement processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. For instance, an innovation fund might become constrained by public service requirements for transparency and clarity, effectively turning into a small internal grant scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Projects with a stronger "core of innovation" may even struggle to progress due to such internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>.

## People-Oriented Challenges
Managing innovation in the public sector is not merely a technical or process management task; it is highly dependent on "people relations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>.

### Siloed Operations
Public sector organizations are often composed of many different departments, each largely in charge of their own areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This can lead to scattered innovation efforts that do not work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. The challenge is to foster collaboration between departments and with external partners, managing the "meeting point" of different organizational and partner portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

### Political Context and External Pressures
Working within a political context means that demands for specific innovations can arise from various stakeholders, often requiring immediate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The challenge is to manage expectations and ensure that proposed innovations are deliverable, considering the appropriate tools and the broader innovation ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

### Fostering a Culture of Experimentation
Public sector organizations, by their nature, prioritize stable delivery of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. This can make it challenging to foster a culture that encourages experimentation and accepts the inherent risks of innovation, where "single innovations can fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.

> "If you have 100% success rate in innovations across your portfolio you're probably in the wrong business so you know you're not actually taking any risks you're probably not doing any innovation work either" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>

## Overcoming Challenges
Despite these difficulties, tools like the Portfolio Exploration Tool (PET) can help by:
*   Providing a starting point for discussions about an organization's innovation portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
*   Helping to understand where innovation is happening and fostering conversations about synergies or discords between projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.
*   Encouraging organizations to think about what they need to "leave behind," "keep," and "do differently" in response to significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>.

Ultimately, successful innovation management in the public sector requires dedicated organizations willing to engage in difficult conversations, look deeply into their existing practices, and build teams committed to navigating the journey of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

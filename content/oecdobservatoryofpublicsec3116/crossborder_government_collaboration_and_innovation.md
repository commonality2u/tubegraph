The Innovation Incubator initiative focuses on fostering [[crossborder_government_innovation | crossborder government collaboration and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>. It is designed as an open dialogue and a moment of openness, rather than a closure, aiming to facilitate an important dialogue among participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. The program highlights the importance of government teams from different countries working together and [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | collaborating across borders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>. It recognizes the extra efforts made by colleagues to share their challenges and experiences in finding positive solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

The journey of [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | international collaboration on governance innovation]] is acknowledged as not always "flashy" or "flawless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>. Therefore, the Innovation Incubator adopts an experimental approach, serving as a "safe space" for exchanging and learning in a protected environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This incubation process itself is an experimental initiative, and the positive reaction from the global community confirmed its beneficial potential for participating countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Its primary goal is to bring value to projects, provide a safe space for teams to work [[crossborder_government_innovation | across borders]], and facilitate [[collaborative_learning_and_innovation_in_government | collaborative learning]] to improve practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Rationale for Crossborder Collaboration

An initial global exploration of existing incubators and accelerators for the [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | public sector]] identified that the public sector has its own specificities, with government roles differing from those in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Two key takeaways from this exploration of 88 case studies highlighted the need for [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | crossborder government collaboration]]:
1.  **International Borders as Barriers** Despite globalization, international borders still impede [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | collaboration between governments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Other sectors have been more efficient in [[crossborder_government_innovation | collaborating across borders]], indicating room for improvement in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
2.  **Need for Shared Platforms** There is a clear need to strengthen [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | collaboration across borders]] by creating a shared platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This is crucial because some challenges are transversal, crossing borders, and even when challenges are not shared, they are often similar, warranting collaboration on tools, learnings, and accumulated experiences from different governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

The initiative aims to transform these "blind spots," where borders hinder government collaboration, into "sweet spots" by specifically focusing on and making these obstacles the center of the Innovation Incubator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. This led to the development of a government-to-government Innovation Incubator model that promotes [[crossborder_government_innovation | crossborder collaboration]] among governments facing similar innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

## Program Value Proposition

The program's value proposition translates into several key aspects:
*   **Peer Learning Process** It facilitates learning among peers and brings in experts to contribute insights and learnings, nurturing the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   **Recognition and Visibility** It provides well-deserved recognition and visibility to government teams making significant efforts to produce successful, impactful, and value-creating initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:15]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Support** The program is designed for long-term support, believing in the importance of weaving close relationships and building trust between teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Iterative Learning** The entire process, which began in December 2023, uses iteration loops to generate knowledge for continuous improvement of the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions in Practice

The Innovation Incubator initiated a "call for challenges," receiving 72 submissions from 25 diverse countries across all continents (except Antarctica) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. These challenges were identified as being at the cutting edge of what innovation teams struggle with or strive to achieve in their governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. Following this, a "call for solutions" was launched, inviting government teams working on similar issues to share their accumulated learnings and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Initially planning to select four solution providers, the high quality of 26 submissions from 18 countries led to the selection of eight, demonstrating their experience, willingness to partner, and focus on practical consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

Four key challenges and their matched solution providers were presented:

These examples demonstrate the range of [[examples_and_case_studies_of_innovation_across_borders | innovation across borders]] and the practical application of [[challenges_and_success_factors_in_crossborder_collaboration | collaborative solutions]].

## Advisory Board and Collaborative Learning Track

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) Secretariat is supported by an Advisory Board of international experts, whose role is to broaden perspectives, challenge assumptions, and share experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:48:00">[55:48:00]</a>. Key insights from the Advisory Board emphasize the value of the initiative:
*   **Tackling Barriers to Innovation** Starting by identifying and tackling barriers to [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | innovation and collaboration in the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:31:00">[57:31:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling Impact** Scaling the impact of innovations not through replication, but through lesson learning and sharing ideas, diversifying the outcomes and adapting to different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:09:00">[58:09:00]</a>.
*   **Creating Safe Spaces for Learning** Creating a "safer space for innovation" where organizations can learn from each other's successes and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. This is crucial as the public sector often has low tolerance for failure, yet failure is essential for learning and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. The initiative provides "critical friends" who can offer advice and share firsthand experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.
*   **Addressing Organizational Development** Public services are good at conceptualizing ideas but less successful at embedding new solutions into existing systems and scaling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. The program helps ensure that valuable projects don't remain small and local, facilitating radical solutions that "stick" beyond incremental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>.

In addition to the main incubator track, a parallel "cohort-based learning track" was created for 30 government teams worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. This track offers thematic sessions on areas such as open experimentation, cultural transformation, [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | citizen involvement]], evidence-based policymaking, and scaling public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>. Teams learn novel ways of working, exchange resources, and share opportunities through structured collaborative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>. Participants value the opportunity to gain insights from experts and international peers, learn best practices, and receive criticisms to avoid pitfalls in their own projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The incubation process is just starting, and the program is seen as a pioneer initiative that will ideally be the first of its kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. The community of practice is encouraged to help improve future initiatives and disseminate the insights and learnings generated to create value in participating countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation aims to support governments in their transformation journey by connecting them [[crossborder_government_innovation | across borders]] and supporting experimental processes like this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.

The program is an ongoing experiment, testing its model and methodology, and continuously improving based on critical engagement and feedback from participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. It is designed to be a "critical friend," a safe space for learning and exchanging ambitions, and for trying out things without guaranteed success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. While not a magical solution to all problems, it demonstrates the importance and possibility of connecting [[crossborder_government_innovation | across borders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. Supported by programs like the European Commission's Horizon Europe, it enables OPSI to invite communities to share challenges and potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. The initiative counts on challenge owners for their pioneering work in stepping forward, and solution providers for their engagement in sharing accumulated knowledge, including both successes and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>. With 30 additional teams in the cohort-based learning track, the program aims to collaboratively tackle cutting-edge issues without clear, pre-set answers, fostering new, unexpected ways of delivering value to public administrations and improving citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:53">[01:20:53]</a>.

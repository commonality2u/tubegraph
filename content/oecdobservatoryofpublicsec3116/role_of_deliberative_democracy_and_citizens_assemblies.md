The relationship between government and citizens is undergoing a significant shift through various [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | democratic innovations]] occurring at local, regional, national, and international levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This evolution is crucial when considering contemporary democratic challenges and the future of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Drivers for Change
People's expectations regarding [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | participation in public decision-making]] have changed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While there is evidence of reduced trust in government, citizens are more engaged than ever on issues affecting them and their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. They seek to contribute meaningfully to decisions that impact them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This demand has led to [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | democratic innovations]] that empower citizens to inform and shape policy and service design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Reframing the Citizen: From Consumer to Agent of Change
John Alexander, founder of the New Citizenship Project, argues that the relationship between individuals and organizations, including citizens and the state, has often been framed as a consumer relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In this "consumer democracy," the individual's role is primarily to choose from offered options, rather than actively shaping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. A helpful analogy contrasts choosing from a menu with being allowed into the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

The goal is to infuse the democratic relationship with the same creativity and energy typically seen in consumerism, making democracy joyful, meaningful, and dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This shift is seen not merely as a "nice-to-do" but as an existential challenge: failure to evolve towards a more dynamic, [[participatory_processes_and_governance | participatory mode of democracy]] risks its complete loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Proponents of this shift aim to bolster and build up democracy against these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Deliberative Democracy in Practice

### Agora Brussels
Pepin de Bruycker, an Agora MP in the Brussels regional parliament, exemplifies this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Agora Brussels advocates for the permanent installation of a citizens' assembly – a deliberative body of randomly selected citizens with a direct say in policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The Agora MP seat is used to organize citizens' assemblies and defend their decisions in parliament, making citizens "agents of their own political change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This initiative aims to give the city back to its citizens, fostering [[citizencentered_governance_and_engagement | citizen-centered governance and engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Democratic Fitness
Zakia Elvang, co-founder of We Do Democracy in Denmark, emphasizes that democracy is a design that can be redesigned, not something static <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. She advocates for "democratic fitness," treating democracy as something to be actively done, trained, and practiced to remain strong and competent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. We Do Democracy trains young people in "democratic muscles" like listening, empathy, compromising, and activism, moving democracy from abstract lecture rooms to active, playful arenas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### The Conference on the Future of Europe
Gaitan, from the common secretariat of the Conference on the Future of Europe, highlights it as a large-scale [[participatory_processes_and_governance | democratic participatory exercise]] with a strong deliberative dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. It involves four randomly selected European citizens' panels, meeting over several weekends to reflect on Europe's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. The conference operates on three pillars: a multilingual digital platform for contributions, the European Citizens' Panels, and a plenary session mixing citizens, national parliamentarians, European parliamentarians, and government representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

This initiative is innovative in applying deliberative democracy at a pan-European level, involving citizens from all EU countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. The intention is to catalyze a longer-term change in people's relationship with EU institutions, moving away from the perception of them as distant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Challenges and Tensions

### Power and Follow-up
A crucial question revolves around the "contract of power" and ensuring that citizens' participation leads to meaningful influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. Critics worry that without real power or accountability, such initiatives risk disappointing or "letting down" participants, becoming "one-sided" contributions without long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. The concern is that governments might "cherry-pick" recommendations, implementing only those already foreseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.

For impact, there's a need to clearly define the expected outcomes and acknowledge that these processes are not direct democracy, but complement representative democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. Establishing "democratic impact goals" beyond just legislation—including trust-building, networking, and fostering engagement—could provide a broader language for evaluating their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>.

### Digital vs. Physical Spaces and [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | Technology Governance]]
Dan Podjed, an anthropologist, highlights the increasing time spent in front of screens, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, raising concerns about the importance of physical reality and public spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. He warns that relying solely on digital platforms for democracy risks feeding "digital capitalism" or "digital feudalism," where individuals provide free data that benefits a global elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. A key challenge is maintaining the "analog component of democracy" and ensuring the right to privacy and invisibility when desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.

John Alexander adds that the privatization of public space, both online and offline, influences power dynamics. When platforms for political discussion are based on advertising and consumption models, it creates an "unhealthy dynamic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

### Trust between Government and Citizens
A core dilemma is whether governments truly trust citizens to make the right decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. The shift requires governments to initiate trust by putting meaningful power into citizens' hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. It also demands that civil society and citizens step into that power when offered, rather than rejecting it, fostering a "virtuous cycle" of power being offered, taken, and more being asked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

### Media's Role
There's a recognized need for a [[cultural_change_and_medias_role_in_shaping_democracy | cultural change in the media]], encouraging them to cover innovative, future-oriented, and peaceful democratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. Such visibility is crucial to create impact and pressure politicians to act on citizen recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Commitments
Despite the challenges, there is a prevailing sentiment of hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. Hope, as defined by Rebecca Solnit, is a combination of clarity (seeing the world as it is) and imagination (seeing what could be if involved) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.

Personal commitments to driving this change forward include:
*   **Trusting the people:** Shifting from expert-based solutions to [[citizencentered_governance_and_engagement | people-centered solutions]] by involving citizens in identifying problems, analyzing, interpreting, and testing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. Solutions should be made "with the people, not just for the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:45">[01:09:45]</a>.
*   **Encouraging cultural change in media:** Promoting media interest in [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | democratic innovations]] to ensure visibility and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.
*   **Fostering entrepreneurial innovation:** Recognizing the crucial role of entrepreneurs and the private sector in driving [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | democratic innovation]], bridging the gap between the public sector and civil society for fast-paced, risk-willing energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. Creating physical "democracy garages" can provide spaces for collaboration and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.
*   **Persistent advocacy for [[inclusive_and_accessible_democratic_participation | inclusive and impactful democracy]]:** Continuously pointing policymakers to the importance of listening to citizens and engaging in dialogue to foster a more inclusive, deliberative, and meaningful democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. This aims to build cities that are "by and for its citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>.

The overarching sentiment is one of "yes, and..." – acknowledging that progress is happening and moving in the right direction, but that further steps are needed, especially in truly shifting power relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

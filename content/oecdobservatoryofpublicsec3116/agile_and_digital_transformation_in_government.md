The world is rapidly changing, making the future unpredictable, and understanding the sources of disruption is crucial for navigating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Citizens, accustomed to excellent services from the private sector, now expect the public sector to also be customer-focused, efficient, innovative, personalized, and technology-enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The key challenge lies in how the public sector can provide such high-quality services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Core Principles for Transformation

To meet these expectations, governments must [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovate]] and transform how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This involves:

*   **Agile Practices and Structures**
    *   Formalizing agile working practices, such as remote working, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The pandemic demonstrated that [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | public administration]] can be agile and responsive, adapting quickly to new ways of working and communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The goal is to embed this agility and [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation]] into structures and work processes to create a "better normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   An agile [[role_of_digital_transformation_in_public_administration | public sector]] organization should be flexible to adapt to citizens' needs, flatter, connected, team-based, and aligned with strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

*   **Collaboration and Co-creation**
    *   Collaborating outside the government ecosystem is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   Exchanging good practices with other governments globally is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   Co-creating services with citizens is essential, requiring the promotion of active citizenship and the creation of platforms for direct connection with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

*   **Data-Driven Policy Making**
    *   Emphasizing the importance of using data and analytics for building evidence-based policy making and finding innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Workforce and Organizational Development

Achieving this transformation depends on the right people in the right places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Key aspects include:

*   **Strategic Workforce Planning**: This involves recruiting innovative and collaborative civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Job and Process Redesign**: Redesigning jobs and processes is important to enable greater efficiency and innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: Continuously upskilling and reskilling civil servants is crucial to keep pace with new technologies and complex societal problems, preventing skills from becoming obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   Future essential skills include critical thinking, creativity, [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation]], problem-solving, and anticipating future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The most important skill will be the ability to continuously learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   [[role_of_digital_transformation_in_public_administration | Public administration]] should become a learning organization, capable of learning from the past and anticipating the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Overcoming Inertia and Envisioning the Future

The public sector has historically been built for predictability, stability, control, and managing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. These "stability-seeking and bureaucratic institutions" face strong forces that resist change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. While these traits are valuable, especially in times of crisis, there is a constant push for [[digital_transformation_of_public_services | transformation]], [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation]], embracing [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital]], and connecting with citizens to meet diverse societal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

### Strategic Approaches
*   **Imagining New Futures**: Instead of starting from the present, organizations should imagine desired new futures and mobilize stakeholders around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This includes new approaches, new types of organizing, new leadership, and new thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Foresight and Scenarios**: Utilizing foresight, scenarios, and future thinking allows organizations to immerse themselves in potential futures, becoming more humble yet ambitious about uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This systematic exploration helps in understanding stories around the future and placing oneself in the shoes of future citizens or decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Co-creation and Collaboration**: Combining design methods with foresight is powerful, enabling diverse stakeholders—decision-makers, experts, and citizens—to explore different futures and make informed decisions collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **"Dynamic by Design"**: The public sector should aim to be dynamic by design, not just have separate stable and dynamic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. Dynamic organizations are also resilient by design, able to offer services and solutions even in complex situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. Investing in long-term capabilities, like [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital infrastructure]], can enhance this dynamism and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

### Challenging Entrenched Thinking
Some entrenched futures that need to be challenged include:
*   **Linearity**: The deep-seated paradigm of linearity, which has driven modernism and a technocentric belief in rationality, suggests that the future will always be a progression and better than the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. However, current generations often believe the future will be worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. A collective imagination is needed to build a more inclusive, circular, and connected economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.
*   **Traditional Capitalism**: The notion of capitalism being solely an opposition between government and market is a mistake; markets are co-created by various actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. Governments should be more open and radical in rethinking the kind of markets and capitalism they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.
*   **Growth Narrative**: The dominant growth narrative, often focused on GDP, is deeply entrenched in governmental economic statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. This narrative has not adequately addressed climate emergencies or inequality, which have worsened even as economies grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>. This future needs to be rethought and debunked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

### Required Capabilities for Future Governance
Key capabilities for governments to navigate uncertainty and drive change include:
*   **Framing and Reframing Problems**: The ability to take problems out of policy silos and reframe them in ways that citizens understand and that motivate public sector employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. This involves adapting problem framing as the future constantly changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.
*   **Openness**: [[role_of_digital_transformation_in_public_administration | Public organizations]] are becoming more open by design, requiring engagement with diverse stakeholders and viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This means flatter, team-focused organizations and openly designed [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.
*   **Ethics of [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | Innovation]]**: With increased openness and innovation, civil servants need a strong capability to think about their own ethics and biases, and to integrate others' perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.
*   **Diverse Analytical Capacities**: Governments tend to look backward with analytical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. Building diversity into public sector organizations—including diverse analytical viewpoints like ethnographic analysis alongside economic data—is essential for responding to a constantly changing future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>.

## The COVID-19 Impact

The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a major accelerator of change, speeding up the adoption of technology and directing the [[digital_transformation_in_government | public sector]] towards different types of interaction with citizens and greater automatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. It also highlighted the responsibility of government to address the unequal effects of these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>, such as the disproportionate impact on low-skilled labor due to automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

The challenge is to be humble about uncontrollable complexities while being ambitious in influencing and acting on the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. The "liquefaction moment" created by the pandemic, where previously solid structures become fluid, presents a short-lived but crucial opportunity to rethink and redesign the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.

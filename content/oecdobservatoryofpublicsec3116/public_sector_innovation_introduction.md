This article provides an introduction to [[Public sector innovation]], how the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) views it, and a foundational understanding of problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The content is based on a webinar hosted by Kevin Oren, an Innovation Specialist at OPSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Welcome and Webinar Overview
This webinar, the first of its kind for OPSI, aimed to introduce [[Public sector innovation]] and problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Participants include beginners, intermediates, and expert practitioners with diverse experiences and valuable perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The goal is to encourage engagement and contributions from everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Observatory of [[Public sector innovation]] (OPSI)
The Observatory of [[Public sector innovation]] (OPSI) was founded in 2016 as a partnership with the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. OPSI functions in three key ways:
*   **Uncovering what's next** Identifying innovative practices within and outside Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Being a trusted adviser** Partnering with countries on specific issues to help them develop new ways to provide value to citizens and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Turning innovation into the new normal** Embedding innovation into the regular way of doing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The OPSI team, though small, comprises members who have all been public sector innovators and employees, which helps keep their work grounded in what is practical in different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Defining [[Public sector innovation]]
There isn't a single, specific definition of [[Public sector innovation]] because it is highly dependent on context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. What is innovative in one country or organization might not be in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

However, OPSI has identified three common factors or commonalities of innovation:
1.  **Novelty** Introducing new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
2.  **Implementation** Having creative ideas is only part of the innovation lifecycle; ideas must also be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  **Impact** The implementation must have an impact, though measuring this can be challenging, especially for truly novel activities where appropriate metrics might not be immediately clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Innovation often appears as a grand achievement, making it seem out of reach for ordinary people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. However, [[Public sector innovation]] 101 focuses on the "building blocks" and the "sloppier part of innovation" where things fail and many steps lead up to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. It's about celebrating the small, behind-the-scenes work that makes innovation accessible to everyone in their current jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Why [[Public sector innovation]] is Needed
A study on the innovation culture and system in Canada (and ongoing in Brazil) revealed several reasons why [[Public sector innovation]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>:
*   **Changing functions** The world is constantly changing, leading to expectations that government services also evolve to keep pace with changes in citizens' private lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Closing the gap with the private sector** There is often a gap between the quality and responsiveness of services from the private sector and those from the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. The public sector must rethink how it delivers value to close this gap, rather than just expending effort to maintain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **No room for spectators** Innovation should not be limited to "innovation labs" or specialized training that feels inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Limiting participation naturally hinders a government's ability to innovate, so everyone needs to be engaged in some way, even if not as an expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Citizens and politicians want more** With increasing functional changes and new possibilities, citizens and politicians have growing demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Failure to respond risks a mismatch where government provides services no longer desired by citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Innovation as a core competency** [[Public sector innovation]] needs to be embedded everywhere, as a core competency, to enable better responses to future crises or unforeseen needs for rethinking government service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Ways to View Innovation
OPSI identifies three distinct ways to view innovation:
1.  **Delivering on today (Mission-driven innovation)** Innovating to deliver current missions of ministries, departments, or sub-organizations differently to produce better value based on existing goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
2.  **Delivering on tomorrow (Anticipatory innovation)** Looking at "weak signals" and future trends (e.g., automated cars, AI, blockchain) and innovating around them today, knowing it will take time for governments to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
3.  **Ensuring readiness (Capacity and capability)** Building the capacity and capability to innovate when needed, ensuring the right resources are in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Essential Skills for Innovators
While core job-specific skills remain critical (e.g., a lawyer knowing law), additional skill areas are needed to foster innovative thinking and achieve different results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. These "skill areas" become more effective with practice, and their application is influenced by opportunity and motivation (the AMO model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>:
*   **Iteration** Doing things quickly, cheaply, and with reduced risk to get faster feedback and achieve better results, as seen in Canada's experiment mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Data Literacy** Understanding how to use data to comprehend impact, information, and gain greater insights into problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **User Centricity** Putting the actual end-user (citizen) at the center of government work, shifting from process efficiency to citizen impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Co-designing with users helps break down barriers between policy and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **Curiosity** Being able to ask questions, look for new ways of doing things, and engage in "horizon scanning" to identify cutting-edge practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Storytelling** Telling a compelling, short, concise, and memorable story that resonates with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Insurgency** Questioning the status quo and trying things in new ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. While sometimes seen as "a pain," insurgents can be the best source for identifying what is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## The Innovation Lifecycle
OPSI has developed a six-step innovation lifecycle, distinct from many other models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>:
1.  **Identifying Problems:** Ensuring the right problem is being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
2.  **Generating Ideas:** Collaboratively developing new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
3.  **Developing Proposals:** Filtering ideas to select those for deeper exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
4.  **Implementing:** Putting ideas into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
5.  **Evaluating:** Assessing outcomes, which is a major challenge for innovation groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
6.  **Diffusing:** Sharing best practices and lessons learned (including failures) across the organization, an area where the public sector has traditionally struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

This lifecycle is not linear; users may need to jump back and forth between stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Problem Framing
Problem framing is the crucial first step in the innovation lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### The GE MRI Machine Example
General Electric (GE) developed a world-class MRI machine for children, investing hundreds of millions in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Despite its technological excellence, hospitals complained that children were terrified of it, leading to 80% needing sedation, which can have neurological impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

Instead of framing the problem as a design or technology failure, GE engineer Doug Dietz reframed it around the "experience of using the MRI machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. They transformed the machines into themed environments (e.g., pirate ships, outer space) and trained technicians to tell stories that incorporated the machine's noises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This simple, low-cost solution reduced sedation rates to under 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This example demonstrates how reframing the problem can lead to entirely different, more effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

### The Double Diamond Design Methodology
The Double Diamond design methodology illustrates two main phases:
1.  **Framing the problem:** This involves a "discover" phase (understanding and investigating the problem) and a "define" phase (narrowing down to the actual problem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
2.  **Defining and finding the solution:** This involves an "ideate" phase (generating new ideas) and a "deliver" phase (narrowing down and testing solutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

However, in government, public servants often start *after* the first diamond, either being given a pre-defined problem or a solution to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. Ignoring the crucial problem-definition stage, where sufficient time is often not spent, can lead to disappointing results, a lack of return on investment, and a constant search for new solutions without addressing the underlying problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

### Why Governments Struggle with Problem Framing
OPSI's lifecycle report on problem framing identified common challenges:
*   **Push for quick responses over right responses:** Government often prioritizes immediate solutions, even if the apparent problem is just a symptom of a deeper issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
*   **Problem complexity and intimidation:** As new information emerges and problems are analyzed, they can become large, complex, and unwieldy, making them intimidating or beyond one's responsibility to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Changing problems:** Problems can constantly evolve or turn into entirely new issues not initially understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

### The Problem Framing Cycle
New information should be the starting point for asking questions to better frame a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. This involves a cyclical process:
*   What is known? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>
*   What is possible? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>
*   What is expected? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>
*   What is actually needed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>
*   What is the problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>

This iterative process, fueled by continuous feedback and new information, helps evaluate understanding of the problem and situation, leading to tweaked or entirely novel solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

### Tips for Better Problem Framing
Practical tips for individuals or groups to improve problem framing:
*   **Clarifying intent:** Clearly define what is actually trying to be achieved, beyond surface-level metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Making assumptions explicit:** Differentiate between definitive facts and assumptions, especially anecdotal information, to challenge assumptions and correctly frame the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **Avoiding jumping to conclusions:** Resist the urge to immediately jump to solution mode after limited investigation of a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   **Connecting with others:** Be inclusive and collaborative by bringing in people with different experiences and perspectives to broaden understanding of the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.
*   **Reframing the problem:** Approach the problem from different perspectives to make it easier to identify various solutions (e.g., instead of "too hot weather," reframe around "appropriate clothing") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

### Common Problem Identification Tools & Strategies
While not exhaustive, common tools and strategies for problem identification include:
*   **Dashboards:** Provide data but often don't explain the "why" behind results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.
*   **Horizon Scanning:** Looking at what is happening across different organizations or countries to find similar problems or solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   **Design Thinking (Human-Centered Design):** A methodology focused on designing experiences, services, and products to fit citizen needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.
*   **Systems Thinking:** Analyzing problems through a holistic lens, considering all actors and interconnected elements to fully understand the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Insights:** Understanding how people behave and make decisions, a growing area in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
*   **Peer-to-peer Learning:** Working with peers and networks who face similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations:** Constantly seeking new methods and ways of doing things within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.
*   **Innovation Labs:** Structured environments for innovation, with various models and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

Each tool has strengths and weaknesses in framing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

### Practical Exercise: The Five Whys
A simple yet effective exercise for problem framing is "The Five Whys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. This involves defining the current problem and then repeatedly asking "why" it's happening to gain a deeper understanding of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>.

For example, when customer satisfaction scores were stagnant, asking "why" revealed that anecdotal assumptions were prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. Engaging with end-users uncovered the core issues: the service was "too complex" and "too slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. Further "whys" revealed complexities rooted in organizational history, policy, and a confusing website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. Simple website tweaks directly improved customer satisfaction, demonstrating how this method can reveal underlying issues and lead to effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

### Overcoming Challenges in Conservative Cultures
[[Public sector innovation]] in conservative, risk-averse government cultures is challenging due to political, media, and internal factors like fear of failure or ingrained traditional methods, particularly when using taxpayer funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. Innovators need resiliency, a willingness to push despite stumbling blocks, and a supportive network of peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.

For practitioners, it's advised to focus on areas of direct control and influence ("own your 50 or 100 meters") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. Small improvements within one's scope can drive change and influence others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. Quietly testing new approaches and then presenting results to management can also be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. Sending leaders to innovation training to experience design cycles, iteration, experimentation, and prototyping firsthand can build understanding and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

The traditional government model of multi-year studies and analyses before implementation is often ineffective, as predicting future outcomes precisely is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>. Countless government projects have failed or become sunk costs despite extensive planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. The key is to overcome the belief that this traditional methodology is more successful or reduces risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.

Instead of trying to predict the future perfectly, the mentality should be to acknowledge that the right answer isn't always known at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>. The goal is to study the problem, identify a few best solutions, and test them quickly and cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. Even if these initial tests fail, valuable insights are gained, leading to more informed, higher-chance-of-success investments with quicker results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

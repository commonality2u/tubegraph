Panelists from Georgia, Slovenia, South Africa, and Portugal shared their experiences, underscoring how [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] became a cornerstone for governance models and democratic societies during unprecedented times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

## Importance of Trust and Transparency
Several nations found that [[Building trust in public institutions | citizen trust]] significantly aided the implementation of decisions and compliance with public health measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

*   **South Africa** In South Africa, the consistent and perceived as "correct" sharing of information led people to [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] the government's messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. Communication directly from the highest office, such as the Minister of Health and the President, brought [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] and legitimacy to the measures, leading to widespread compliance like mask-wearing and mall regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. This high level of [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] allowed the government to minimize the spread of the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Georgia** In Georgia, the way the government communicated with its citizens helped to build [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. In contrast to peaceful times where distance might exist between government and public, crisis situations necessitate [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] and public confidence for effective and speedy decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. The absence of public protests against government decisions indicated the presence of this [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.
*   **Portugal** Portugal emphasized that [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] begins with communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>. A massive communication campaign, including a motto "we are on" and an online website/app providing information on government responses, helped citizens find vital information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. This transparency was crucial when implementing rapid measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

## Strategies for Building and Maintaining Trust

### Transparent Communication
Transparency and honesty were key to building [[Building trust in public institutions | citizen trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>. Georgia, for instance, never hid difficult information from the public, instead educating them with the participation of epidemiologists and other specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

### Citizen Participation and Dialogue
*   **Georgia** Actively involving citizens in decision-making and fostering dialogue with businesses and representatives from all parts of government helped explain decisions and make citizens feel part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.
*   **Portugal** Beyond providing information, governments must involve citizens in choices, particularly concerning socially acceptable measures and digital tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. This approach reinforces collective decision-making and builds better democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
*   **Slovenia** The importance of [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] is highlighted by Slovenia's experience where fake news made it harder to gain public confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>. The key to obtaining [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] is to involve experts like doctors and epidemiologists, rather than just bureaucrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. Improving digital literacy is also crucial to ensure correct information reaches the public, thereby improving [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.

### Admitting Mistakes and Corrective Actions
The willingness to admit mistakes and make corrective actions based on public feedback also contributes to a participatory approach to decision-making and [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

## Impact on Future Expectations
The experiences during the pandemic have set new, higher standards for public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. Citizens now expect more explanations, more communication, and more proactive actions from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. This increased involvement and participation mean that core principles like competence, responsibility, openness, and [[Trust and Transparency in Public Policy | transparency]] are no longer mere words but real needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>. The crisis revealed that public administration can operate differently, setting a new reality for citizen-government relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

*   **Poll Results** A poll conducted during the discussion revealed that "digitalization of government services" and "intergovernmental cooperation at all levels" were top priority areas, followed by "cross-sectoral collaboration in policy and service delivery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. This suggests that while citizens may not explicitly prioritize data governance and privacy (only 17.2% concern), their overall agreement with these themes testifies to a generally high level of [[Building trust in public institutions | trust]] in government actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

In summary, the crisis reinforced that [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | citizen trust and its impact on governance]] is paramount, fostered through transparent communication, active [[citizen_engagement_and_trust_in_uncertain_times | citizen engagement and trust in uncertain times]], and a commitment to adapting and improving public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

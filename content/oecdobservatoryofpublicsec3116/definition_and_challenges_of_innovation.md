Innovation is generally quite difficult to define because it involves new things, novelty, and concepts that did not exist before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Innovation in the Private Sector

In the private sector, innovation is understood as something new that is implemented in a market context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its purpose is for a firm to gain a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This can manifest as a new service, process, product, or any other form of new thinking applied to achieve a direct market proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Innovation in the Public Sector

Defining innovation becomes more [[challenges_in_managing_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | complicated]] in the public sector because it lacks the market feedback system present in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Public sector innovation is defined by its novelty, meaning things that are new to the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Crucially, these new services or ways of thinking must always be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It's not about inventions or ideas that have been discussed, but about actually applied new thinking, services, or processes that have had a real impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Unlike the private sector, competitive advantage is not a relevant concept, as the government is typically the sole player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Instead, public sector innovation contributes to a change in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Impacts and [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | Challenges]]

The impact of innovation in the public sector doesn't have to be exclusively positive or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For instance, digital advancements that provide services more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> could simultaneously exclude parts of the population that lack access to digital tools or the capability to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Therefore, innovation can yield both beneficial and detrimental outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, but it is fundamentally about new things implemented in a new context that bring some form of value to the population they serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The "Government Beyond Recovery" conference, co-organized by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), highlighted the opportunity to develop new, bold missions in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These missions aim to prevent future global crises and address long-term challenges, emphasizing the need for agile and iterative approaches to avoid "lock-in" in an uncertain future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

A key aspect of this discussion revolves around balancing technological solutions with the necessary behavioral and societal changes to ensure successful mission execution.

## The Challenge of Future-Ready Missions and Uncertainty

A poll conducted during the conference revealed that only 17% of organizations have mechanisms to make their missions future-ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Conversely, 41% reported no such mechanisms, and 43% were unaware of their organization's future preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

The areas identified as most uncertain and influenced by continuous change include:
*   **Climate Challenges:** 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>
*   **Societal Challenges:** 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>
*   **Economic Challenges:** 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>
*   **Health Challenges:** 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>

This highlights the complexity of setting targets that can adapt quickly as conditions change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Moving Beyond Purely Technological Solutions

A significant observation in mission-oriented innovation policy is that most missions remain heavily focused on technological or scientific solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. There is a notable gap in venturing into behavioral dimensions, changing social norms, or altering population habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>. This approach assumes that technology alone can preserve well-being without requiring changes in human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.

The OECF report "Climate Actions Through a Well-Being Lens" addresses the need to integrate well-being and behavioral dimensions directly into missions to facilitate a smoother transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>.

### Strategies for Integration and Adaptation

To address these challenges, several strategies are being adopted:

#### 1. Co-creation and Broad Participation
Missions are most effective when they are co-created by diverse actors, including public and private sectors, researchers, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. This ensures shared objectives and strong commitment from all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>.

*   **Japan's Visionary Council:** Japan's "moonshot goals" use a visionary council, including a science fiction novelist, to broaden perspectives and explore new options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>.
*   **Danish Green Research Strategy:** Denmark insists that all relevant ecosystem partners, from companies to public administration and private investors, co-create the roadmaps for their green missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. This deep dialogue helps align understanding of targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>.
*   **European Commission Missions:** The development of the European Commission's five missions involved extensive citizen engagement and strong agreement across policy areas to ensure robustness and buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>.

#### 2. Agile and Iterative Approaches
Given the uncertainty, missions need to be adaptive and not locked into initial assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Learning Mindset:** Denmark's approach to the green transition involves building the program while executing it, fostering a "learning mindset" where partnerships are allowed to adapt, integrate new partners, and embrace uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Pace and Courage:** The urgency of challenges like climate change demands courage and speed, implying a need to "try things" and learn from both success and "failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>.

#### 3. Governance and Monitoring
Effective governance structures are crucial for managing missions and allowing for dynamic adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

*   **Decision Points:** The European Commission emphasizes decision points and an analytical framework to monitor performance, allowing for steering and adaptation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>.
*   **Regular Evaluation:** Missions require governance models that allow for regular evaluation, including international progress reviews, and the ability to stop or finance new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:01">[01:51:01]</a>.
*   **Nested Structure:** While broad mission statements (e.g., net zero by 2050) remain stable, lower-level objectives require constant adaptation and a portfolio approach to projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">[01:52:52]</a>.

#### 4. Financial Roadmaps
Beyond technological roadmaps, there's a need for clear financial roadmaps that can accommodate evolving needs and attract diverse funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This involves linking resources to ambitious goals and demonstrating a credible path for investment beyond initial funding sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>.

#### 5. Overcoming Incumbent Bias
To truly transform, missions must include new businesses and partners beyond existing economic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:08">[01:39:08]</a>. This requires challenging existing mindsets and actively integrating diverse perspectives, such as social science and humanities, into technological solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>.

#### 6. Leadership and Trust
Strong political, financial, and organizational leadership is essential to maintain ambition, ensure public good perspective, and drive consensus across disparate actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. Building trust through transparent information sharing and fostering a "culture of cooperation" are key to supporting challenging endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:56">[01:59:56]</a>.

#### 7. Unexpected Allies
Seeking out unexpected allies within and outside traditional government structures can strengthen mission implementation.
*   **Parliamentary Engagement:** Engaging bipartisan political leaders can champion the agenda and make missions non-partisan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:31">[01:56:31]</a>.
*   **Supreme Audit Bodies:** International audit bodies like GAOs and NAOs are valuable in assessing and guiding long-term public investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:49">[01:56:49]</a>.

### Integration of Strategic Foresight in Mission Development
[[integration_of_strategic_foresight_in_mission_development | Strategic foresight]] is critical for making missions future-ready and adapting to change.

*   **Anticipatory Approach:** The OPSI actively works on an anticipatory and [[mission_oriented_innovation_strategies_and_practices | mission-oriented approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The OECD has launched a [[mission_oriented_innovation_challenges_and_implementation | Missions Action Lab]] focusing on proper implementation in an iterative and agile manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Moving Beyond Current Problems:** Foresight helps to "uncouple" from today's problems and obstacles, fostering discussions about future needs and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>.
*   **Methods:** This includes scenario planning, identifying strategic "blind zones," and developing "future personas" to consider the needs of future users and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:40">[02:04:40]</a>.
*   **Youth Engagement:** The importance of youth involvement was considered from the start in the European Commission's work, especially through citizen engagement activities and connecting with the European Solidarity Corps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:30">[02:08:30]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Justice:** Questions about [[Crossdisciplinary collaboration for mission success | intergenerational fairness]] and accountability for future generations are increasingly prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:06">[01:46:06]</a>.

[!NOTE]
Future foresight practitioners are seen as an "amazing resource" to tap into, as young people are already using systematic ways of thinking about the future to transform their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:09">[02:06:09]</a>.

## Reframing "Failure" in Mission Contexts

The concept of "failure" in missions is complex and not binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   **Learning from Experience:** Missions, especially ambitious ones, inherently involve challenging boundaries and creating disruption, meaning some aspects will succeed while others will not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.
*   **Performance Measurement:** Existing monitoring and performance measurement systems are often not attuned to allowing for "failure" as a learning opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. There is a need for sympathetic performance measurement and governance systems that foster a "culture of cooperation" where blame is not attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>.
*   **Exit Strategies:** Having an exit strategy for missions that are not progressing as intended can prevent brutal backlash and allow for the repurposing of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>. For example, Norway's "moon landing mission" for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) was scaled down but kept some activities, leading to a new, larger CCS mission years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>.
*   **Side Effects:** Past missions, even those considered failures in their primary objective, have often led to unexpected positive side effects and technologies (e.g., the internet and smartphones from Cold War-era missions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

*   **Ambitious Goals:** These missions aim for a 70% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero by 2050, while also increasing biodiversity and enhancing Danish industry competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>.
*   **Holistic Approach:** Success relies on systemic development covering the full value chain, including technological, financial, and regulatory roadmaps, and connecting all players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.

### OECD (Philippe Larue, Science and Technology and Innovation Directorate)
*   **Missions Action Lab:** The OECD's [[mission_oriented_innovation_challenges_and_implementation | Missions Action Lab]] helps countries and public authorities implement ambitious [[types_of_innovation_missionoriented_enhancement_adaptive_anticipatory | mission-oriented innovation initiatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   **Future Orientation:** Missions are, by definition, future-oriented, providing directionality and intentionality towards long-term objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.
*   **Co-creation:** Missions are co-created by diverse actors to achieve shared objectives and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>.
*   **Blind Spot of Foresight:** While missions are about the future, formal foresight practices are not always integrated, presenting a "blind spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a>. However, this could change how foresight informs policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>.

### Norway (Kirsten Carlsen Haukedal, Senior Advisor at Norwegian Digitalisation Agency)
*   **Seamless Services for Life Events:** Norway's digital strategy prioritizes seamless services for seven "life events" (e.g., new in Norway, losing/finding a job, seriously ill children), recognizing these as complex problems requiring systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.
*   **Mission Approach for Wicked Problems:** A mission approach is explored for "seriously ill children" and "voluntary organizations" to foster collective, targeted efforts from public, private, and voluntary sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>.
*   **Top-down Goals, Bottom-up Efforts:** This approach combines ambitious top-down goals with broad bottom-up efforts to create solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:48">[01:49:48]</a>.
*   [[integration_of_strategic_foresight_in_mission_development | Strategic foresight]] is used to future-proof services by analyzing driving forces for change, potential impacts, and using scenario planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:45">[02:02:45]</a>.

### School of International Futures (Cat Tully, Founder)
*   **Transformation at Speed:** The School of International Futures uses strategic foresight to achieve social outcomes and transformation, recognizing the urgency and complexity of current challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>.
*   **Alternative Scenarios:** Foresight helps identify alternative scenarios for an uncertain future, going into "different alternative worlds" to co-create a desired future while remaining aware of risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Work includes the campaign for a nuclear-free weapons world (considering geopolitics, post-carbon economy, technology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>, and addressing childhood obesity in London (engaging excluded families, understanding urban food system evolution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:53">[02:40:53]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Institutions:** Key challenges include fostering leadership for "right brain" activity, creating institutions that support long-term, [[public_sector_adoption_of_mission_oriented_approaches | mission-focused]] thinking, and weaving networks/coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Fairness:** Emphasizes assessing investments for their impact across different generations, both alive now and in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:06">[02:46:06]</a>.
*   **Democracy and Applied Policymaking:** The need for representative democracy and policymaking to become more emergent and applied to reflect complex times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>.

Two recent [[OECDs Role in Public Sector Innovation | OECD reports]] provide an [[public_sector_innovation_overview | overview]] of [[public_sector_innovation_overview | public sector innovation]] in Brazil, aiming to help the country adopt a more deliberate and systemic approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. These reports are part of a broader collaboration stemming from a 2015 Memorandum of Understanding between ENAP (Brazil's National School for Public Administration) and the [[OECDs Role in Public Sector Innovation | OECD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Background and Purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

Following a successful 2016 review on digital government, two new reviews were initiated focusing on:
1.  [[Innovation models and methods in the public sector | Innovation skills and leadership]] in the Brazilian public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
2.  The [[framework_for_innovation_in_public_sector | innovation system]] of the public service of Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

These reports were launched at the fifth edition of Brazil's Public Sector Innovation Week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The external perspective offered by the [[OECDs Role in Public Sector Innovation | OECD]] was crucial in providing continuity to the innovation agenda during Brazil's administrative transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Report 1: Public Sector Innovation System in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>

This report addresses how Brazil can adopt a more deliberate and systemic approach to innovation, moving beyond sporadic and reactive activities often seen in public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Key Messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>
*   Innovation is essential for Brazil to achieve its ambitions and solve real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   While innovation has occurred, a deliberate and systemic approach is required for consistent and reliable innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   A systemic approach involves assessing the extent and mix of innovation, and the degree of stewardship over the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Why Innovation is Crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
Innovation, defined as something novel to the context that achieves impact, must be central to effective government, not just an occasional activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Complex challenges necessitate routine, ongoing innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

In Brazil, [[innovative public administration practices | innovation]] can address issues like inequality, financial constraints, corruption, and changing demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

### Brazil's Innovation Journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>
Over the last three decades, Brazil has focused on:
*   **Debureaucratization:** Streamlining processes for efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **New Public Management (1990s):** Reforms for effective government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Modernization:** Followed New Public Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation (last decade):** Specific focus on [[public_sector_innovation_overview | innovation]] needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

Key characteristics of Brazil's public service include a legalistic system, strong emphasis on controls and anti-corruption, and a focus on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. While digital transformation has gained momentum, [[public_sector_innovation_overview | innovation]] hasn't been fully integrated into the public service narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Mandates alone are insufficient; continuous effort is required to embed innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Challenges to Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>
The public sector, by its nature, is designed to avoid negative feedback, leading to risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. This contrasts with the private sector's tolerance for risk in pursuit of profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Innovation is also inherently difficult, requiring continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

### A Deliberate and Systemic Approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>
To counterbalance these challenges, innovation needs to move beyond being driven by exceptional individuals, crises, or political commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. A systemic approach requires:
1.  **Extent of Innovation:** Is innovation occurring to the necessary degree? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>
2.  **Mix of Innovation:** Is the current innovation likely to provide the right mix of options? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>
3.  **Stewardship:** Is there effective oversight to ensure the [[framework_for_innovation_in_public_sector | innovation system]] delivers as hoped? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>

### Models for Understanding Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>
*   **Determinants Model:** Examines underlying factors influencing innovation. It identifies three levels of activity:
    *   **Individual-driven:** Common in Brazil, vulnerable to individual burnout or departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
    *   **Organizational-driven:** Focuses on an organization's specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
    *   **Systemic activity:** Integrates collective interests for sustainable innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. The goal is to move innovation from individual to organizational and systemic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   **Innovation Facets Model:** Describes different types of innovation activity:
    *   **Enhancement-oriented:** Building on existing approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
    *   **[[Missionoriented innovation in public administration | Mission-oriented]]:** Addressing big, audacious goals (e.g., putting a man on the moon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
    *   **Adaptive:** Responding to changing conditions on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
    *   **Anticipating:** Asking fundamental questions about future relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

In Brazil, the risk-averse environment often pushes innovation towards incremental and uncontroversial "enhancement-oriented" approaches, despite a need for more radical exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

### System Stewardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>
Innovation, being context-specific, can pull a large, complex system like Brazil's in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. There's a need for collective consideration and explicit responsibility for the stewardship of the [[framework_for_innovation_in_public_sector | public sector innovation system]] to ensure coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

### Findings from Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>
*   Most innovative activity is individual or organization-driven, not systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.
*   Lack of emphasis on underlying determinants of systemic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   Current structure pushes innovation towards incremental and uncontroversial forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
*   Stewardship of the system is largely implicit or circumstantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

### Achievements in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>
*   **Innovation Awards:** Provide insight, underscore value, and inspire others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
*   **InnovaGov Network and Innovation Week:** Mechanisms for socializing innovation, connecting people, and building momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **Collaboration:** Significant cooperation among major actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
*   **Innovation Labs:** Growth of labs across agencies, testing new approaches and fostering sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation Agenda:** Highlighted the value of change and provides a model for system-level transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

### Key Areas of Opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>
Recommendations are categorized by audience:
*   **Whole System:**
    *   Establish an explicit agenda for [[public_sector_innovation_overview | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
    *   Give more attention to structural drivers for innovation to offset inherent inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
    *   Explicitly assign responsibility for stewardship of the [[framework_for_innovation_in_public_sector | public sector innovation system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
*   **Central Actors (e.g., ENAP, Ministry of Economy, TCU):**
    *   Major agencies should have explicit roles in the system's functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
    *   Ministry of Economy should clarify links between [[public_sector_innovation_overview | public sector innovation]] and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
    *   Control bodies (e.g., TCU) should identify how audit and risk management can support innovation, rather than being barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
    *   ENAP, on behalf of the InnovaGov Network, could partner to develop an annual commentary on the [[framework_for_innovation_in_public_sector | public sector innovation system's]] performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
*   **Individual Agencies:**
    *   Identify and publicize innovation priorities within their operations to guide contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

## Report 2: Skills and Leadership for Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>

This report builds on a 2010 study that found Brazil's civil service rigid and lacking clear leadership for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. The concept of innovation serves as a rallying call to rethink civil service organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.

### Why Focus on Senior Civil Servants? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>
Senior civil servants hold pivotal positions to drive or enable change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>. In 2010, there was little coherence in managing these positions or their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

### Challenges and Arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>
1.  **Productivity and Efficiency:** Brazil's civil service is expensive (13% of GDP vs. OECD average 10%; 30% of public expenditure vs. OECD average 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Effective management and leadership of this investment are crucial to maximize talent and address pressing needs like innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.
2.  **Public Trust:** Low public trust in government in Brazil is linked to perceptions of integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. A highly qualified, professional senior civil service correlates with less corruption and greater public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
3.  **Support for Innovation:** Leadership support is critical for successful [[public_sector_innovation_overview | public sector innovation]] and its absence is a major barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

### Skills and Competencies for Innovation Leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>
Public leadership for [[public_sector_innovation_overview | public sector innovation]] is highly contextualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. Leaders must understand their situation and apply appropriate tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. The report identifies six core skills areas for [[public_sector_innovation_overview | public sector innovation]] at the organizational level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. Leaders enable innovation by ensuring their workforce possesses and can activate these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

A survey (with almost 3,000 respondents) found that Brazilian civil servants had a middle-level assessment of their own skills, with less confidence in iteration/user-centricity and particular gaps in prototyping and using behavioral insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. Perceptions of management support for these skills were significantly lower, while organizational readiness fell in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.

### Leadership Model for Innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>
Based on workshops with Brazilian innovators, a leadership model was developed with three main skill groups, founded on public service values and ethics:
1.  **Business Skills:** Aligning resources with needs and using management tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Skills:** Leaders need to understand how innovation processes are supported, how to lead them, and how to create space for professionals using innovation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
3.  **Mindsets:** Empathy, empowering civil servants/citizens, continuous learning, courage, and digital orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

### Senior Civil Service System Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>
Most [[OECDs Role in Public Sector Innovation | OECD countries]] have structured processes for defining, developing, selecting, and reinforcing leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. This model considers "supply and demand":

*   **Supply Side (Building Leaders):**
    *   Clearly define needed skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.
    *   Provide opportunities to develop these skills for current and future leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
    *   Map the workforce to identify existing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.
    *   Create a learning culture for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
*   **Demand Side (Calling for Leaders):**
    *   Appoint leaders using these skills as selection criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.
    *   Provide support through training and performance/accountability mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

### Main Findings on Leadership in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>
Brazil shows effort in building the *supply* of leadership through various training initiatives, largely led by ENAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. However, there's very little done on the *demand* side, due to a political system where appointments are often made at the will of the president and ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

### Recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>
Recommendations are phased: immediate, second stage, and longer-term.

#### Building the Supply:
*   **Unify and Network:**
    *   **Immediate:** ENAP and others could develop a hub to connect people working in innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.
    *   **Second Stage:** Use this network to develop a unified [[innovative_public_administration_practices | innovative leadership competency model]] reflecting Brazil's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.
*   **Align Leadership Development Ecosystem:**
    *   **Immediate:** Create greater transparency on available training offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.
    *   **Second Stage:** Conduct a skills analysis to align training with the competency model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

#### Building the Demand:
*   **Develop Merit-Based Hiring:**
    *   **Immediate:** Identify where merit-based practices are already used in the federal administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. A presidential decree has established minimum criteria for certain positions, which is a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Second Stage:** ENAP could conduct pilots to support merit-based hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.
    *   **Longer-term:** Scale up and embed these practices in legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>.
*   **Innovation-Oriented Objectives in Job Profiles and Assessments:**
    *   **Immediate/Ongoing:** Innovation must be reflected in job descriptions to provide accountability and protection for civil servants undertaking innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. This is complex as innovation isn't easily measurable as a mechanical performance objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

## Role of Universities and Open Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>

*   **Public Universities:** Play a crucial role in the [[framework_for_innovation_in_public_sector | innovation system]]. They can:
    *   Provide insight into problem identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.
    *   Generate and source new ideas (technology, policies, practices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.
    *   Offer rigor in studying and appraising implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>.
    *   Create the pipeline of future public servants and leaders by teaching relevant skills and presenting public service as a valuable career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
    *   Promote stronger connections between government, universities, and the private sector to develop innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.
*   **Open Innovation:** Can be a valuable tool, recognizing that solutions may come from outside government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. It is particularly effective when broad aims are clear (e.g., for "enhancement-oriented" or "adaptive" innovation) but may be less suited for exploratory "anticipatory" innovation where questions are less defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. Brazil is experimenting with open innovation platforms like challenge platforms for public challenges, where organizations offer awards for solutions or prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>.

The reports are seen as providing an adequate vision of the context and challenges, along with good suggestions for the path forward in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>. The continuous work involves translation and dissemination of the documents, fostering discussion, and creating networks to engage more people in the [[public_sector_innovation_overview | public sector innovation]] conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.

The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) identifies different types of innovation within the public sector, categorized by their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Even without formal acknowledgment or stewardship, organizations inherently operate with an innovation portfolio composed of various innovation projects and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

While various categorizations exist, from incremental to blue-sky thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, OPSI emphasizes looking at innovation from its purpose to understand what it intends to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. These different types of innovation are connected to broader public sector goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## [[Mission oriented innovation | Mission-Oriented Innovation]]

[[Mission oriented innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] aims to achieve specific results and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. It is typically a top-down approach, where goals are agreed upon at the highest level or through social agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Once goals are set, there's a high level of certainty in terms of delivering on these agreed-upon missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. Examples include goals related to climate change or welfare development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

[[Mission oriented innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] can provide political legitimacy, creating space for other types of innovation that might question the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:48:00">[53:48:00]</a>. Projects in this area should support the overall mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[51:26:00]</a>.

## [[Enhancement Oriented Innovation | Enhancement-Oriented Innovation]]

[[Enhancement Oriented Innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] focuses on improving existing processes and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. The purpose is to do better at what an organization is currently doing, striving for greater effectiveness, efficiency, or broader reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. This type of innovation operates within current systems and is characterized by high levels of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Common drivers include austerity, cost reduction, or increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. For public sector organizations, being strong in [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] is often natural due to highly specialized staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:14:00">[39:14:00]</a>.

## Adaptive Innovation

Adaptive innovation emerges from the system itself, responding to evolving situations and new demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. Unlike [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]], adaptive innovation cannot be steered top-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. It requires fostering creativity and creating open spaces for employees to experiment and explore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Organizations providing caregiving or support services, such as those working with children and families, often engage heavily in adaptive innovation as they gather direct feedback on what works and how to adjust their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15:00">[36:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>.

## [[Anticipatory Innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]]

[[Anticipatory Innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] focuses on preparing for future fundamental shifts, new risks, and uncertainties that may challenge current public sector activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. This area is characterized by high uncertainty and requires a different type of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Ideas within [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] can be critical to an organization's strategic aims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. It's crucial for addressing massive challenges like climate change or nature collapse, which demand radical solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:00">[39:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>. This type of innovation involves dealing with uncertainty and moving beyond conventional approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:49:00">[40:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:59:00">[40:59:00]</a>. [[Anticipatory Innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] projects can even be designed to question an organization's core missions, exploring hypothetical future scenarios to prepare for drastic changes (e.g., a healthcare system without doctors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:27:00">[52:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:46:00">[52:46:00]</a>.

## Innovation Portfolio Balance

An organization's innovation portfolio doesn't need to be equally balanced across these different types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[35:52:00]</a>. Instead, it should be meaningfully stewarded to align with the organization's specific aims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. For example, a service provider focused on welfare might naturally have a portfolio dominated by adaptive innovation, while an organization like NASA or the European Space Agency would likely have a highly anticipatory and [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:00">[37:11:00]</a>.

Despite a focus on one type, organizations still need to perform other types of innovation. Even highly anticipatory organizations must consider efficiency and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:00">[37:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:46:00">[37:46:00]</a>. It is essential to consciously allow for different types of innovation to prevent becoming "locked in" to a single approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Connecting the innovation portfolio to strategic aims is crucial for effective stewardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>.

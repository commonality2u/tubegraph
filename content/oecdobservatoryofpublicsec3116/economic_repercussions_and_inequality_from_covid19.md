The [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19]] crisis has revealed existing vulnerabilities and created new needs, particularly highlighting significant inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The prevailing policy directions seen previously in [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | government]] require radical reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Exposing Systemic Flaws
The [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19]] crisis is not merely a crisis caused by the virus, but rather a crisis that emerged because the virus exploited a flawed system of [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | governance]] that is not aligned with its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. The pandemic is a symptom of deeper underlying systemic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

Historically, the period after the Industrial Revolution saw exponential growth in GDP per capita and significant improvements in quality of life and life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. This was enabled by modern [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | governance]] and professional public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>. However, this progress came at a cost, contributing to a large ecological footprint and growing inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.

The pandemic has accelerated existing global long-term trends and revealed that a paradigm shift is underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. The vulnerabilities experienced today attest to the inadequacy of the worldview that established our current systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Deepening Inequalities
The [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19]] crisis has exacerbated existing inequalities:
*   **Income and Unemployment** In Helsinki, Finland, a direct correlation has been observed between [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19]] prevalence, higher unemployment, and areas with a larger immigrant population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. The "reddest areas" in Helsinki had an eight-time greater [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19]] prevalence than the rest of the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Racial Disparities** In the U.S., Black individuals were twice as likely to die from [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19]] compared to white individuals (13.2 deaths per 100,000 people for Black individuals vs. 5.7 for white individuals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. This demonstrates how [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19]] and issues like Black Lives Matter are inextricably linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   **Poverty and Health** The [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | economic crisis]] triggered by [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19]] is predicted to lead to a million lost life-years due to people falling back into poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>. In the Netherlands, the difference in life expectancy between someone with an average income and someone with a low income is ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>. [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | Governments]] need to invest in preventing extreme poverty, as it has an enormous [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_health_systems | health effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.

## Financial Strain on Governments
Austerity measures are imminent due to the enormous repercussions on [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | government]] budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.
*   **Budget Shortfalls** The city of Santa Monica, California, faces a $224 million shortfall on a $650 million annual budget (a 35% gap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. Helsinki, Finland, has a current budget gap of over half a billion euros, or 12% of its overall budget, after only four months of [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.
*   **Projected Gaps** It is not unreasonable to expect 25% to 50% budget gaps in 195 countries and over 110,000 cities worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. These gaps stem from dwindling tax revenues, higher unemployment, and rising [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_health_systems | healthcare]] costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.

## [[government_responses_to_covid19 | Government Responses]] and Future Challenges
[[role_of_government_after_covid19 | Governments]] have provided subsidies and incentives to maintain the current economic model, including bailouts for industries like airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. However, there's a growing movement to connect this conditional support to [[impact_of_covid19_on_sustainable_development_goals | sustainability goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The European Commission's "Next Generation EU" recovery package aims to repair the social fabric, protect the single market, and rebalance balance sheets, pushing towards a green, digital, and resilient future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

The challenge is whether the momentum for change can be sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. There is pressure to return to "fast, cheap, quick carbon-intensive jobs" to restore economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.

[[role_of_government_after_covid19 | Governments]] face difficult questions:
*   Should public resources be used to save old structures or to help those affected prepare for new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>?
*   Restoring the system to its previous state might be a self-defeating strategy as it would no longer be adapted to new circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

New strategies are needed, including an "exit strategy" that transitions the system and addresses legacy lock-ins like a carbon-intensive economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. This requires broad, socially engaged, and creative efforts, rather than being confined to narrow interest groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.

### Austerity and Investment
Austerity is unavoidable, but the approach to it is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. Instead of cutting to save, the principle should be to "cut to invest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>. For example, for every euro saved, cut two euros and invest the extra euro into building new capabilities and a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. This requires quick action within a 100-day window during periods of calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.

## Outlook
The current moment offers a great learning opportunity for [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | governments]] to build new approaches and "muscles" to deal with the cascading effects of the crisis and address the underlying inequalities it has made visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>. This means rethinking [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | government]] and seizing the opportunity for innovation for a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:44">[01:29:44]</a>.

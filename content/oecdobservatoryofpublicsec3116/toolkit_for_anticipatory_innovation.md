This article explores the development, purpose, and challenges associated with creating and implementing a toolkit for [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]], drawing insights from the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and its collaborations with various countries.

## What is the [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]]?

The [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]] is a key initiative aiming to provide a practical approach to [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]], translating concepts into actionable steps to tackle real challenges in public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Development and Collaboration

The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is developing an [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | anticipatory innovation starter kit]] in collaboration with Portugal and the Danish Design Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The project with Portugal is part of an incubator program, supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme, focusing on incubating this starter kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This collaborative and experimental approach allows OPSI to learn from practical implementation and develop an international version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### Purpose and Target Audience

The primary purpose of the [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | starter kit]] is to raise awareness and generate interest in [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. It aims to help public managers and civil servants, particularly beginners, get started with [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and strategic foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. It seeks to bridge the gap between knowledge and action, providing a practical way for people to engage with future-oriented work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.

### Design Principles

The design principles for the [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | anticipatory innovation starter kit]] emphasize:
*   **Problem-solving**: It should be based on solving real problems and translating those problems into actionable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **User-friendly**: It needs to be accessible and support a "do-it-yourself" mentality, without creating new dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Actionable and Adaptable**: The kit should produce real changes and bring value, being adaptable to different contexts and capable of recontextualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:10]">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Socializing Skills**: It aims to stimulate critical abilities like imagination, boldness, and prospection within public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:35]">[00:56:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>.

### Structure of the Kit

The [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | starter kit]] is structured around three main areas:
1.  **Problems**: Starting with real problems that users face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
2.  **Challenges**: Translating these problems into specific challenges, such as:
    *   Producing and imagining alternative futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
    *   Envisioning a new organizational vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
    *   Setting a concrete strategy to attain goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   Understanding the drivers of change surrounding an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
3.  **Tools**: Each area of challenge will have different tools to help tackle them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## [[Challenges and Strategies for Implementing Anticipatory Innovation | Challenges and Limitations]]

Implementing [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and using related toolkits face several barriers and limitations.

### General Barriers to [[Anticipatory innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]]

OPSI identifies five broad categories of barriers that contribute to an "impact gap," where excellent future thinking doesn't lead to implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>:
*   **Competency Barriers**: Strategic foresight practice is not universally embedded in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **Cultural Barriers**: Unreasonable expectations that foresight will reveal the future like an oracle, leading to an over-reliance on experts who are not clairvoyant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Barriers**: Difficulties with complexity, uncertainty, and exponentiality, leading to avoidance of uncertainty, groupthink, recency/availability bias, and a lack of imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
*   **Corporate Barriers**: Organizations may hold onto implicit or "zombie futures" that are no longer relevant in a fast-changing reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Communication Barriers**: Different perceptions of the future within an organization, leading to implicit disagreements that can hinder action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

In Chile, for example, less than 20% of public funding for science, knowledge, technology, and innovation is invested in organized future-facing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>. This highlights a lack of political agreement, sufficient funding, and multidisciplinary technical knowledge needed to address future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. Slovenia faces challenges with changing government support for innovation initiatives, emphasizing the need for civil servant motivation and soft skills like collaboration and co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:48:48]">[00:47:57]</a>.

### What a Toolkit Cannot Do

A toolkit for [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]] is not a panacea and its benefits are not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. Limitations include:
*   **Not a Solution Provider**: It is a platform for asking questions and a process of learning by doing, rather than providing immediate answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.
*   **Requires Sustained Effort**: [[Anticipatory innovation | Anticipation]] and strategic foresight require long and sustained effort to bear fruit; breakthrough moments are not expected from a single exercise or kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.
*   **Cannot Complete the Picture**: While it enlarges understanding, it cannot fully complete the picture of relevant considerations for decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Needs to Lead to Action**: Foresight work must lead to action, strategy, and implementation; simply thinking about the future is not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:49]">[01:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:26]">[01:05:24]</a>.
*   **Not Prescriptive**: It should be modular and adaptable, not a rigid recipe, allowing users to upgrade or leave aside parts as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.
*   **Does not Replace Political Engagement**: It is crucial to consider how the toolkit connects to other approaches and how politicians are engaged, as desired futures involve the value domain of politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

## Broader Context and Future Outlook

[[Anticipatory innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is a key facet of OPSI's multi-faceted innovation model, particularly important because it tends to be systematically under-invested in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:02:11]">[00:01:42]</a>. The distinction between [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipation]], [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]], and [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] is crucial, as effective change requires mechanisms and structures within governments to enable sustainable work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:40]">[00:02:26]</a>.

The goal is to foster an "authorizing environment" and "agency" for [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:03:03]">[00:02:57]</a>. By offering scenarios as a public good and promoting a less linear way of thinking about the future, societies can agree on desires and identify opportunities and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:11:28]">[01:10:48]</a>. The ongoing work aims to refine the [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | anticipatory innovation starter kit]] and continue to support governments in embedding strategic foresight and [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]] into their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:18:02]">[01:17:44]</a>.

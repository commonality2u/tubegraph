Innovation, once established, can create "dominant designs" that are very difficult to change later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These historical innovations often lock in subsequent systems and practices.

## Examples of Lasting Impact

A prime example is the decision regarding which side of the road cars drive on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This initial choice, an innovation in itself, locked in many aspects of mobility systems, including how cars are driven and how infrastructure is developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The way our current infrastructure and driving practices are structured is based on these long-ago "training practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Government's Role in Shaping Future Systems

Today, new technological and non-technological choices are becoming innovations and dominant designs in their own right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Governments need to be proactive and engage with potential future developments, even if uncertain, to influence emerging dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This proactive approach, known as [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]], is crucial because once a dominant design takes hold, it becomes extremely challenging to alter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

For instance, with the rise of artificial intelligence, governments need to consider ethical and technological solutions *now* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Similarly, questions about blockchain solutions should be addressed preemptively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Influencing these decisions today ensures that governments can help shape what is best for their people and countries, rather than being forced to adapt to realities set by others in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
